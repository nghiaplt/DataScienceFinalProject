Pew army? 	2
People doesnt know him, he laughs when he is confused, or in an awkward situation and doesnt know what to do. He did not think about it and how everyone got angry and of course he would never take a picture of a dead person without bluring it. And yes he tried to make a positive video of what a bad problem suicide is and why its not the right way to end your life.	3

@Wlfclud AJ Like I said Raghu Seetharaman is a pussy who will never admit he's wrong or that he lost.	0
@Raghu Seetharaman Did you just dab? That's so fucking stupid and doesn't help your side of the story. he  showing a dead body, laughing at it, doing other messed up shit  (like throwing plates and leaving the shards of glass for his dog to step on), is not okay. Think of how their family felt, seeing their dead loved one hanging from a tree on YouTube. Movies and video games are different, those characters do not exist in the real world. This was a real issue and you are not right in any way. The fact that you would support he and his terrible decision to go into the Suicide Forest, and especially his decision to FILM it when he knew he'd find at least one person dead, is fucked up. Maybe if you were a part of the victim's family, you'd understand the pain and horror they went through when seeing this video. That enough to get you to stop defending yourself because you know you're wrong?	2

'what he  did WAS funny' Explain that to the mans family.	1
The point is people here don't know you so they can't tell if you are joking. Saying 'Can you take a joke?' sounds like a cop out.	2

Just remembered this vid and I was like huh wonder where that body came from	0
he should delete his channel cause he got beaten by ksi	0
News anchor is sure impressed by how much he owns	1
He honestly has a lot more to apologize about than just this. Not saying this is nothing because I saw that video he peosted and I dont understand how he could have by any means thought it to raise awarness. Its disrespectful to the family and to the person who unfortunately took their own life. He was obviously going to get an uproar from this because its sickening. Being someone whos dealt with suicide and attempts multiple times both very person and first hand, it made me furious when he posted it ti have a laugh with hus friends as I knoe it infuriated many other people as well. He has caused so much damage, done so many wrong things that apologusing isn't enough, he's a horrible person for thinking half of the things hes done is ok, I just wish he would actually think before he did...	3
Stupid he  fans still supporting him after this	0
Block him and bring Bart Baker backkkkk	1
First off it's absolutely amazing that anyone would watch a complete f****** moron like this guy. He's never worked a day in his life could care less about anything but himself and makes millions of dollars doing nothing. I bust my ass and do this every single day for real I stand in the middle of forest beings every single day. I have 20,000 still pictures from live video of these creatures. This is a Bigfoot Forest it's amazing how f****** stupid all of you are there's no other way to say it. You're all brainwashed and you don't even know it if you want to see real stop by. Freaking amazing how dumb people	2
WTF why did he even do that tweet out stuff instead of putting footage of suicide and dead bodies on a app that kids watch	2
He deserved worst then death	2

Wouldn't the left claim this to be a hate crime? They're race obsessed.	2
he did not get smacked by ksi. It was a split decision, and if he retained his 2 points, he would have won.	2
Yeah - pretty sure his career will survive tho. Split decision and scored the bigger knock down....not like he got devastatingly finished....	3

Of course Japan is the best at kamikaze	1
He just did a harakiri to his own career.	0
This is why i hate he 	2
I hate he , hes a spoiled little BITCH and he needs to grow up and get off YouTube. Hes fame that comes from little fan girls makes him have a chip on his shoulder	2
They funked over Lagan  because they have to many feelings fucking liberals suck. Just because it affected you someway because it was suicide doesnt mean he did anything wrong. Its not like he laughed because there was a dead body. He showed a video that he happen to get and wanted to raise awareness. I think hes a dick but not for that. Was just to many feelings involved by a bunch of clowns from liberal Hollywood.	2
SNEADLEVISION SLOTMAN except hes fans are 8-10 years old and hes showing a dead body	0
You do realize most of his audience are kids? Some probably younger than 10.	3
What a idiot	2

im just here bc of nas daily	0
Did nas post on that area	0
Fuck U he	2
Fuck your profile picture 	2
You fucking chap	2
Did anybody else see the video?? or just me	0
was the I get views appropriate ?	0
Yea to address the fact he wasnt trying to show a dead person for views or money	0
Ofc it was he has to flex how much views he gets lol	1
I think his channel needs to be demonetized for what he did That is very disrespectful towards to a deceased person and he should be charged with wait I don't know what criminal type of charges right now in Japan	2
He should have taken that stupid hat off.	2
'followers in YouTube' really? I think it's 'Subscribers' :) .	1
I don't see the problem .....if you hide death the entire time which the USA does and we are one of the only countries that does it.....it's a growing up experience and as a American you will only see it when you travel or war unless it's your family and the first time will destroy you especially when it's a loved one.	3
Wtf does it matter on the news its fucking YouTube and btw ik ABC news is only doing this for views	2
There is no need to discuss about his reaction. One person committed suicide and we should focus on prevention. Depression is still taboo and not accepted in society. If you have any psychic problems, people want you to hide them. We have to learn to talk about it in society!	3
Here in 2019, after Ninja mentioned him in his say regarding 'Content Creators'.	3
Dont people ever think that it probably was a murder	2
Thats a great idea for a killer like if u kill someone jest put them in the suicide forest people with think They kill themselves	2
What an asshole he is	2
he  is a dumbass ive never liked him his personality is just douchey	2
All of the comments on this video, are all *memes*  	0
I got to see the video	0
It's on archive.org	1
Beware cu'z he change just for like a week/ now his back on business/ dont get effected of this desease	2
Aaron  wanted everyone to make sure he is not affiliated with him 	0
Why is everyone like mad at him he did not mean to say what he did	2
As everyone else has pointed out, he had plenty of time to review what he was saying and doing while he was filming, editing, and then uploading. In such an involved process, even if he wasn't completely in control of all his faculties whilst seeing a dead person, he should have known that the presentation was such that it should have been edited out and either discussed later or not brought up.	0
Yes, people come there in the forest and end there lives, they tie the string on the trees and they walk and stay there...they tie a string cause they might change their minds you can barely see light there i saw it from nas daily and nas friend went there and died, i know i am young but i know the right thing.	2
Ksi saved his career	1
Ok but if YouTube deletes suicide could they delete porn?LITTLE KIDS WATCH IT TOO GET A BRAIN YOUTUBE!	2
ABC NEWS IS STUPID	2
Congratulations he you are ruining youtube's reputation you fucking genius you are destroying the business that makes you get money because you are too fucking stupid to understand why what you are posting is wrong	1
You libtards do worse. Please dont be so hypocritical.	2
Holy hell this is Crazy	0
here this is for u he  he doesn't care about what's happening (november 3 2019)	3
Lets be honest everyone makes jokes about this and dont fucking lie	2
The only idiot is the person who toke they own life in my opinion other people suffer from the stupid thing hes done by hanging himself	2
It happened. Get over it. Hate him for whatever reason. But the past is the past. and we can't change it.	2
Aight, let's forgive Hitler and Stalin, same goes for Mao, they killed like 6m+ but hey, that's years ago	2
He as over 15 million YouTube followers !!!!! 	1

Can someone share the real clip of the body	0
I really don't understand the backlash...	3
@Slap shot Studios1708 i believe they said the age range of his content was targeted to high schoolers to 21. So if he puts whats in it in the title, and he targeting this group but a kid sees it, I would say it's unfortunate. However this level of backlash is goofy imo.	2
DropSixteenTV Tv yes he does and if you see people who are fans of he theyre mostly children and theyll just click on the video because theyre big fans of him	2
@Slap shot Studios1708 but he put in the title there's a dead body from suicide and he doesn't make his content for kids. So no, I don't.	2
DropSixteenTV Tv most of hes fans are kids and he goes into a forest known for suicides and films a dead body and you dont know why people are upset?	3
Bruh why do people even watch him	0
I still see no problem with that video and I never have. Theres a lot worse on YouTube.	0
Ben Richardson you have to be really stupid to not think thats its ok to film a dead body when most of youre fans are kids	2
Clearly you havent had to deal with suicide and dont even say that you have	2
It was extreme disrespect to that man and the firest itself. Read up on it it explicitly say dont film and dont take pictures he slapped that whole country in the mouth and laughed	2
And thats the difference between a person who has empathy and one who doesnt. Never disrespect the dead especially knowing this one killed himself due to to toughlife situations.	2
Ben Richardson ??	0
He is such a douche bag.	2
Glad he won't be able to step a foot on Japan again. Haha 15 Million followers but no common sense.	2

Loser	1
Did he write that or did his intern write that 	0
There are 2 things I can't believe:	3
1- How idiot he is to think posting this was a good idea	2
2- How some people can still defend him	0
@Pancaqq no problem	1
Joo Leote yeah it was lol I just thought Id say that because people think he laughed disrespectfully! Sorry!	0
@Pancaqq Yeah, I laugh when nervous. But I didn't complained about he laughing, I complained about him showing a dead body in yt. Idk how much he censored, cuz I didn't watch the original video, but I heard it was little	0
Joo Leote there is a lot of evidence here that he may not be as crazy as you think. Have youve ever seen a dead body? Its scientifically proven that seeing somebody sad makes you sad. Also, in some people, feeling uncomfortable comes out with a laugh. Should he have posted it? No. There is no reason to not believe there was some human nature in there. Imagine how scary that wouldve been.	0
This big idiot  is still gaining subs coz JJ saves his carrer	2
6 reasons why he  is hated.	2
1. He is still healthy.	1

0:34 'He has 15M *followers* on Youtube.'	1
Most kids will be in disgust.	0
'I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention . . .' ?! he  is  disrespectful and a complete imbecile to lack any respect for the Dead. Also, on his video, he did not believe that the hang individual is a real corpse and he fooled around the hanged body. Over all, HE KNEW the nickname of the infamous Forest that its called 'Suicide Forest' for a sole reason!!!! In other words, he  is a DUMB FUCKED UP ASSHOLE who has no considerations about how precious life really is . . . . . . . .	2
'15 million followers on YouTube' 	1
Uh, they're called subscribers	0
The real question is that she said his channels followers	0

He is irrelevant	0
he : says he was trying to raise awareness	0
Me:butcha didn't	3
But honesty suicide is not a joke and what he did was wrong	3
In my opinion he's a big idiot because he just ruined his career like majorly.	2

Nobody cares about this dood anymore	0
followers on youtube uh	0
At the time of this, I was a HUGE fan so as soon as I got that notification, I clicked straight away and I was one of the unlucky few. Some would call me  lucky  but its honestly a scaring image and I know how others who also saw this feel. The whole video was so wrong from the way he was going on about seeing dead bodies and he seemed excited to the fact that he showed the body to an audience made mostly of teenagers and young children but at least he blurred out the face of this poor person. More you tubers need to think twice or three times before posting something 	0
R.I.P.	3
But still, it was horrifying to see.	3
In my opinion, you were lucky to see that video. If it hadn't happened, you would never have seen he's true colors.	1
YouTube should of ban him for life	2
'top entertainers of the world* filming a dead body and uploading it is entertaining?	0

Or just go outside and kill someone since theres something wrong with you	2
So go online and search for it...	0
I like how everyone is rooting for him with the KSI vs he  and they just totally forgot he laughed at a dead body last year 	1
'YUPPPPPPPPPP'	0

15 Million FOLLOWERS?! Seriously I thought they new what Subscribers were on YouTube because of the fact of them posting on it......	0
'He has 15 million *FOLLOWERS* on Youtube'	1
This guy is disgusting! He is not sorry and never will be because if he was he'd never had posted the video! And don't get me started on the 'Oh, but he apologized and took down the video' sh** cause he only did it when he was loosing subscribers by the second! I'm not one to hate but if you still like this guy after this video and countless others like this then you are just as horrible as him.	2
Also, can you believe the nerve of this guy to say in one of his tweets 'I didn't do it for views, *I have views*' as if he's telling you how popular he is even when he's supposed to be apologizing!? Honestly guys, I don't know how you kept calm and unbothered when you were saying all this. If I was there I would have probably told everyone to grab their pitch forks and torches cause we were going on a hunting spree.	2
Don't be like he  or his idiot brother (who I'm sure is just as douchey as his bro, if not I'll be surprised) cause these people are hated by soooooo many people, including me. Be nice, respectful, kind and thank you for letting me rant. I really needed to. Bye	2
Everything about this literally screams he has no feelings	2
jake pal is an idiot a stupid ass hole	2
Thats he  are you sure you arent the idiot here lmao	1

Guys let me explain a little drop of tea. Well if anyone sees a dead body in a freaking suicide forest they r prob gonna ditch the forest but lemme tell u my buddy he was all for the views he made sure that he had to record it. It only makes sense he is a clout chaser. No tea no shade but thats the truth.and ps rip the suicide victim they probably had a hard life sorry my dude. Rest In Peace at least now he is in a coffin probably and not in he s youtube videos.	0
Yes I liked my own comment 	1

Aaliyah hola	1
Seems like people are making a huge deal about this because of who he is not what he did. There are countless similar videos all over the internet. So freakin what.	2
 Hutchinson most of hes fans are little kids and the other channels who show dead bodies are mostly aimed at adults	3
I dont understand why people get so mad about showing a dead body shit if you find my body somewhere video away  give me the opportunity to photo bomb you as a ghost :P	0

Jerr S you right	1
LightningWolf TV oh please. Cry me a dang river, dont make him out like hes the victim in all this. Hes not.	2
I do believe in the old saying, 'What does not kill you makes you stronger.' Our experiences, good and bad, make us who we are. By overcoming difficulties, we gain strength and maturity.Learning lessons is a little like reaching maturity. You're not suddenly more happy, wealthy, or powerful, but you understand the world around you better, and you're at peace with yourself. Learning life's lessons is not about making your life perfect, but about seeing life as it was meant to be.	1
You know you fucked up when even Sansa Stark is pissed at you	3

*battotai intensifies*	2
Why are people mad? It's nothing more than a dead person. Sure, it was someone's family but in the end all we are is dust. This is not an offensive video , people need to grow up	2
You're saying people should come to grips with the fact that this life, everything we have experienced and ever will is gonna eventually end, and that we should make fun of people for which this enternal doom has already happened, disrespecting their family who has not yet come to terms with the fact that they have to live the rest of their lives with this one person?	1

Come on..give guy a break. He didn't record person committing suicide, he just uploaded a video of a dead body he found, he wasn't  thinking at moment about it being insensitive. Hell if i stubbled on a dead body some where i might bust out my phone to record or snap pics without thinking cuz its not something i have seen before and I'd be in shock.	3
You are a horrible person.	2
22 is old enough to know when something is insensitive or not.	2

Post EVERYTHING.	1
Fucking sjw crybabies	2
@Slap shot Studios1708 I know a few people who decided to take their lives. I was the first to call them losers.	2
Life is fucking tough for everyone. Suicide is an easy way out.	3
And it's not what you take it's what you leave behind. People who commit suicide that have families are dicks.	2
It's a selfish act.	2
And you're never gonna convince me that someone who takes their own life should be labeled a 'winner'. 	2
Sorry pal, that's an uphill battle you are simply NOT going to win.	2
Good luck with your idiotic views	1
Mathieu Lafreniere dude hes fans are mostly kids so people are gonna get upset if he posts a video with a dead body and I cant wait for someone you know to commit suicide and for someone to call them a loser	0
I'm sure the mans family and friends wanted him to be known as the suicide victim in a he  vlog.	3
He didnt care he only cared when he got caught smh hes trash	0
What a sociopath!  No true remorse at all!	2
Little over dramatic dont you think?	1
Fuck off it was awile ago dumbass	2
Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.	1
I get that he was a piece of shit,but i don't get why everyone is so sad about that person who comitted suicide..Like WHO CARES?!The idiots who comit suicide don't worth attention,they are just narcisistic and egotistical and they care just about themselves and don't give a shit about the families and friends they left behind!	3

Me:well God damn I though it was subscribers	1
He ducks m	0
I am not standing up for he but they blew this a little bit out of proportion i think we can agree on that	2
Not really this was messed up!	3
Snard Alexander im not saying it wasnt terrible what he did im just saying it went on for way too long and nobody unless you yourself kills somebody deserves to have that much hate and negativity towards them for a whole year and a half. (again im not saying what he did is not terrible and im not saying that most of the hate he got for it was wrong.)	2
Really? Please tell me how showing 6 - 15 year old kid(his audience) a hanging body and laughing about it live is being blown out of proportion. The videos dont upload themselves. He had time to think before uploading. He played it off like an adventure and openly showed the body.  Suicide aside , are you fine with someone making money joking over your family member's corpse.	2
So they let people go into a forest to kill them selves but lose it cuz a guy filmed it. Idiots if u dont want people filming dead bodies then dont let people hang them selves in a public forest.	2
Btw I hate the guy I just think this particular situation is retarded	2
Japans suicide forest is a popular destination and for anyone who wants to find dead body and film it for YouTube videos and shows so look it up on YouTube they have thousands of videos on it  Japan doesnt care they make money from tourists.	0

0:40 targeting an audience made of teenagers and children	1
Nah just children	2
Personally i think you are both children for arguing about such a small thing as age identity. Lol. Who cares. The real facts are (he ) is a piece of shit...	1
@cowdeemo Lol but their not in a different category their in the same which is a fact not a opinion. A opinion on age is basically kinda like 'Oh 12 year olds aren't kids their preteens' that's a opinion but saying teenagers aren't children isn't a opinion. Even people think 11 year olds are preteens but at the end of the day we are all children until 18. Don't know why you people don't get it.	0
@Ilpveanime Iloveanjme Okay, but in this instance, we are referring to children and teens as a different category, according to the main comment.	0
@cowdeemo That is when you talk about children and teens. Everybody have a opinion on who is a child and who is not. How about 11 and 12 are they not children. Also 18 and 19 are adult teens but I'm still going to put them in the adult category.	2
@Ilpveanime Iloveanjme When we talk about Teenagers and Children, we are obviously talking about young kids (typically around 10) and teens who are around age 16. Also, teenage years go up to the age of 19.	1
I dont see why people trippin he didnt kill him he jus got a dead body on video from what I see he realized he made a mistake and apologized and took the video down if it were for views hed really keep the video up there worse shit happening and ppl trippin over a dead body the body doesnt matter when its dead the soul is out and gone wherever he went I like he no matter what no ones says Im tired of this shit 	3
Slap shot Studios1708 yea but I dont hold people accountable for what they did in the past unless its a murderer but even then when that person realizes their mistake is really important and these kids are gonna see stuff regardless this world is pretty ugly hec even Disney has dead bodies in some kid cartoons so we really need to learn to move on but theres a lot of soft hearted people so that pretty difficult rn i understand its morbid and not family friendly at all but at the end of the day no one is perfect everyone makes mistake now hes growing and stuff so yeah	2
Trey Burwell you have to understand that most of hes fans are little kids and people are gonna get upset when he posts a video with a dead body to little kids	3
I probably would of shown the dead body too, we see worse on the internet!! 	0

I didnt do it for views.. 	3

'He posted a video targeting *_teenagers_* and children'	3
Bruh what teen watches this shit	0
The fact that he's popular at all on YouTube or anywhere else just shows the depraved state of America.	2
Lmfao sad thing is... the famous people that lashed out against him. Only did it for attention as well. So in hindsight they are just huge worthless cunts that deserve as much hate as him. I hope they all die soon.	3
He said sorry  its a ded meme now  >_<	0
that doesn't mean anything	0

Bubbadeaux people were gonna find out anyways	0
No he didnt he knew what he was doing	0
Its crazy to think im watching this in august 2019 and i remember watching that video and being traumatized. I was 11 at the time and i thought suicide was fine bc of this video. I remember showing my sibling this video, the part with the body. i was a huge he fan and that changed everything	0
I thought his career was over and felt so happy 	0
@T. K 14 Exactly bro, thats it 	2
@Thanos on drugs nah, I'm cool in middle class, better than being a rich moron, also, he isn't successful, being successful means doing something you love, the dude probably has to act like a moron for his fanboys who think he's cool, but the truth is all of you are just money bags to him	1
My kids saw the video and I was absolutely livid. Especially as I lost my brother through suicide. Suicide is not something to be shown like this talk to the survivors of suicide and see what's left behind not doing what he did	3
Why are people upset about this there are suicide videos all over YouTube, yeah their old but they still show	3
Damarcus Hode because those videos were aimed mostly at adults while most of hes fans were little kids	0
I will disown my kids if they watch this	2

Kourt Nee ah yes because he went into a forest know for suicide, filmed a dead body, edited the video, and uploaded the video on accident	3
@Angela Song why are people defending him he literally showed a dead body	0
Kourt Nee ?????? So what youre saying is he didnt mean to upload the video on purpose or he didnt mean to be disrespectful to the deceased on purpose????? Clearly, he was the one who decided to go to the forest, film the dead body and post it on youtube. Which part of this was not done on purpose? Please help me understand cuz I really dont.	2
he is such a dumb ass he disrespected the japan culture	2

Honestly this got way too much attention. People are too protective in America. If you lived in syria, kids are fighting in wars, dead bodies littering the street.	2
he is a narcissistic sociopath with zero conscience or real empathy . What a friggen loser !	2
I can bet you, I can BET you, that if he didn't get all this backlash and hate, that he would've never apologized for that video, that he would have no respect for that person at all. I BET you that. He is a heartless asshole and that is where I fully lost all respect for him. Absolutely Disgusting.	1
Tbh I always hated him but I saw the video posted and watched it and saw the og video	0
If this video was age restricted, this would get no dislikes	2
This is disrespectful he actually disrespected the Japanese culture to like dude that's just wrong u crossed the line	2
To be fair the dude shouldnt have killed himself in the first place, tho I dont agree with hes actions	0
@Wilisey p do you not realize that well he's disrespecting a dead man n the took he's life and Jake  or he  whoever this is they both disrespected a culture	2

How stupid can you be. he  you are the reason some youtubers suck. he you deserve all the hate. Why the fuck would you show a dead body on YouTube. Stupid ass nigga. I wish i could just slap the shit out of you. You are the reason dashie aint funny, bhd aint funny you son of a bitch. Then you have the nerve to say this was to teach kids not to do suicide. BITCH, you the reason Etika killed himself. YOU MADE YOUTUBE THIS WAY. Stupid ass nigga. You tried to entertain people by showing dead fucking body, and expected nothing to happen. Stupid ass, piece of shit ass, making excuses ass , bottom of my shoe faced ass. FUCK YOUR APOLOGY, FUCK YOUR CHANNEL, AND FUCK YOU.	2

You spelled I wrong.	2
There is no bad publicity	2
And there's actually a forest called suicide forest? If it wasn't for this he guy, I would've never known about such place. Suicide is an epidemic in this modern era. He actually did a great job relating the place.	3
I always knew he'd screw up one day, i just didn't know how bad...	3
U suck for news	2
He dies almost everyday chill	2
Im disappointed. Suicide / Depression is NOT a joke. He should regret that ALOT.	3
The only regret he has is about how it might negatively affect his YouTube subscriber count.	0
Hes not sorry. He really isnt. He just doesnt want his career to end. Which is why I am questioning why he even still has subs. Why do ppl still like him after all the crap he has done. He doesnt deserve his subs. He doesnt even appreciate them. And if he intended to raise awareness then why the hell was he making jokes of the man. It absolutely disgusts me. It really does.	2

He fin sucks	2
1:54 if I remember correctly...in the video he _pointed and laughed_ at the dead man. I might not be correct. I didn't watch the video, but he was smiling WAY too much to be trying to cause a 'positive ripple' and raise awareness about suicide. He and his awful brother disgust me. They need to stop getting attention. Everything they do is selfish and fake and they need to not have YouTube channels. Or any kind of social media. If I could, I would dump them on a remote island, with no cameras, no supplies nothing. And let them not be part of civilizations problems.	3
Screw he  hes an  idiot screw his apology its not ok he needs to go back to that place and find those dead bodies and apologize!!	2

He not the most the entertaining person to me...SAD	3
In my opinion at least dont get mad but, I believe that if it was any other youtuber not as popular as or is he , they wouldnt have received as much backlash. I say this because a lot of people dislike he . And further more onto the celebrities and you tubers, suicide is a very serious topic and should not be joked with, however most of the other people that called out he were probably just doing for attention. But like I said it is a serious topic so most people who called he out were just pissed off with him. I am not trying to defend he. What he did was wrong.	2

I ain't mad or offended at this video at all and I dont see why people are what I see is that if he didnt find that body it would still be there not put at rest and yeah he was rude with his reaction but why people offended at him posting a video of a dead body people are saying kids are watching but let's all be honest kids are not innocent these days anymore they already seen stuff and its different seeing it on video than in real life I'm not taking up for him at all because I'm not a fan I dont watch him nor do i judge him but really what's wrong with everyone getting offended when they should be happy thay the family thats been waiting to get their child back or a love one that's been waiting has got a body to put at rest not to leave that body in the woods would be very disrespectful I think people should go find them bodies in that woods and put then at rest just saying everyone has already been exposed to the world so what's the problem with a dead body I mean I understand why he should have covered it cause it's really disgusting but why get so offended by it I would like to hear others side of the story	0
Seriously he gets views so he didn't do it for views	3
Ppl need to seriously get a life ok I do not pitty cowards who take there life ok my birth father did that and never knew him but I will say this he did not go in thinking it was going to be that way ok he did nothing wrong in his video ok he didnt do shit its not his fault someone did that to them self he was showing the real ness of that forest ppl go there in real life all around the world to really kill them selves there is a movie made on Netflix of this forest so for all ppl sooo concerned go rage on ppl who allow these ppl to go there to do that shit they know why there walking into that forest ok so for ppl to get made at he  ur fucking idiots ok ur made at wat he showed the idiot who willing walked in the woods to hang him self like the coward he was or u made that the ppl running the park allowed the guy to walk in woods to hang him self instead of calling cops and getting this guy help come on ppl get off ur asses do something with ur life get off YouTube and stop blaming ppl for actions they didnt even do he showed the facts and truth of a place in this world that allows ppl to just kill them selves in ppl are fucking retarded	2

How? How was this a mistake? You film the video, you edit the video, you upload the video and not once do you think 'How does this make me look as an inspiration, as a person, and as a YouTuber?' 	3
You have little kids watching your channel, I'm talking 12, 10 and maybe even younger who look up to you for inspiration. And what do you do? You film a dead guy and even worse, you joke about it. They don't know any better than to do this. They don't know right from wrong. They see you do it and think 'that's okay, that'll get me views' when they have phones and can hide away from their parents and watch this stuff. They don't have their parents there watching their every search and every video they watch so their parents aren't there to tell them 'this is wrong. This is VERY wrong, do not joke about this'. 	0
Suicide and depression is NOT something to joke about. I've been through depression myself. I've had friends go through it. I've seen what it does to people, and I can tell you there's nothing funny about it. And for you to find humor in it makes me question whether or not you are actually a human being.	3

I was going to write something but nvm I dont want problems	0
Thats so dumb of course he filmed it anyone would have lol who cares alot worst things on youtube than that	2
I personally dont like him, however I dont think he deserves all the hate. No one deserves hate. Hes a human being for crying out loud! Hes not perfect! Yes, I agree he couldve made better choices in making the video, but hes just a person. He tried to raise suicide awareness in his own way.	2
Hes not funny 	2

Im Japanese and Im really sad and disappointed with how he treated a dead body disrespectfully.  Also, what he did in Tsukiji and Shibuya disgraced other Youtubers so now a lot of Japanese people think Youtuber as immortal people.	3
He should be aware of the fact that he is one of the top influencers in the world and how he could affect kids behaviour.	2
He's stupid.	2
The thing that gets me is that the entire time he's cracking jokes and acting obnoxious and it's clear that they continued filming for selfish reasons. There was no intent to raise awareness for 'suicide victims'. In fact, showing graphic content like this is often what pushes a suicidal person over the edge. Think of how many killed themselves after watching '13 Reasons Why'.	2
I'm pretty sure you shouldn't have posted a video about a person who committed suicide he has so many kid followers it's not even funny teaching more children about suicide might not be the best idea I basically live around death I see it every day and I don't want others seeing the horror of death	3

@YourNextLineWillBe:IsThatAJojoReference MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!	1
This is 'Unbroken' levels of getting punched in the face many times.	2
Who cares. Ppl kill themselves everyday. Leave the guy alone	2
Robert Carpenter and to answer your question on who cares: lots of people do, especially the people who have lost family and friends to suicide. Learn to be more empathic and educate yourself on the matter instead of being an ignorant jackass on the subject.	2
Robert Carpenter wow, youre a special kind of person, arent you? And by that I mean, dumb and pathetic loser.	1
the irony is it's twerps like this who end up committing suicide themselves in about 5 years when their C-List fame comes to a crashing halt (i can't wait for it)	0
Followers on YouTube lmaooooo	1
OK so he says he did it for suicide prevention.... BUT LAUGHS!!!!!!!!! AMERICAN IDIOTS	2

What about james Charles	0
Whats the big deal! He went into the SUICIDE FORREST! He found a body! It happens!	2
Jason Gentry yes, it happens. But not everyone is an idiot and films someone who just killed themselves. Why dont you morons get that?	2
I say this tongue in cheek. But there should have been a few murders in the suicide forest when that video was filmed. They were probably even poking the corpse with a stick when the camera was off.	0
******g get off his back already and stop busting his b****.	2
YouTube please take off this  YouTube. Because everyone trying to forget about . Everyone is trying to forget about it. Please 	3

He filmed it in the video he posted a year ago. He went up to it showing at hands, the body being limp the only thing he blurred was the face and that's it.	0
the only mockery you're making Is of yourself because no one with any degree of common sense thinks this is funny in any way.	2
I intended to raise awareness for suicide prevention.	0

No you didn't. You're still here fuck face...	2
He did it for the fucking money	2
look, did you see it? No. 	2
No picture no proof.	2
@Kauri 798 For a matter a fact, there are re-uploaded videos of the original one. So I agree with you.	1
If you saw his original video then you'll see it, you disrespectful dipshit.	2
He's a moron. He found a body in the suicide forest...NEVER	2
To be honest other youtubers have probley seen stuff like this but not been like him and be so fucking disraspectful and wip out the camera and started videoing because they achally know its wrong to post this stuff and it's so disraspectful for the person that achally died he wasn't trying to show ewernes for suicide I feel so sorry for they family member for that person and show my deepest sympathy.	2
Is statement on 'raising awareness' is bullshit.	2
when do these s make a suicide prevention video when these stupid fam just make crazy stupid videos to get views I mean his just  giving us reasons	2
'I did it to raise awareness, not of views.'	1
Oh BULL SH*T	2
He doesn't seriously expect people to buy that, does he?	0
He gives youtubERS (Not youtube because they allowed that to be posted and waited for him to take it down if you hadn't already realised)a bad name.	2
Though I will acknowledge that there are some pretty toxic people on this platform.	0

Everyone is so angry about he showing the dead body. 	0
Honestly, I'm more pissed about how ridiculously disrespectful he was throughout the rest of the video. 	2
That was the first video I watched of he  and it was my last.	3
The Japanese guy obviously wanted everyone to see his dead body. This guy just walked into suicide forest and committed suicide. What a clout chaser smh	3

Bruh, he couldve just cut it out in editing.	3
Like PewDiePie about that Fiverr video.	0
Moral lesson, dont upload it or regret it.	2
crazy people	2
Bro why do they have suicide park or forest in Japan.	3
This is why I am not that shocked about the outcome of his video. The initial problem is having a forest that is not only known for suicide as a tradition, but popularizing its name to tourists too.	3
FBI Suicides are common in Japan. Now please dont tell me to open up.	2
They lost their will to live, theyre depressed, they dont wanna live again...	3

One day when someone close to him dies he'll realize how wrong this was..what an immature fuck  there's literally children in these comments that have more knowledge than him	2
Hes subsribers are gonna unsubscribe hime t.b.h	1
I saw the video... He didn't do anything extreme or bad.. he did what a 22 year old would do...called police ... Talked about the craziness of the experience... Etc	0
Ms Twentythirteen like I said, Im not crying. But nice talking to you and I hope youre not an asshole to everyone that replies to your comments	2
@Jerr S stop crying to me about this... I don't care... Time to move along son... Don't forget your tissues.	3
Ms Twentythirteen hmm...so youre just an obnoxious outsider looking in and giving your lame opinion? Ok. And would you stop with the crying crap? Like you, Im giving my opinion too. Im not crying about anything, youre just being annoying.	2
@Jerr S I don't know what garbage he rants about on YouTube I've never heard of him until now... And as an outsider looking in I stick to my opinion... *Throws a crying towel to jerr s	0
Ms Twentythirteen youre not defending him, and yet you said he didnt do anything extreme or bad. Psh, BS I dont buy it. And Im not crying about your opinion, Im merely giving you mine as to why its stupid to say he didnt do anything wrong, when he clearly did.	2
Tbh We all expected he  was gonna do some dumb shit sooner or later. What he did was f*cked up his channel deserves to get taken down.	2
i see the dead bodyyyy no censored...	0
ima kid and why would i like this guy??!! he offended one of my fav countries!	2
Hey fuck all of you who are still on the he  Aokigahara forest controversy, this is old, he has improved and been doing all that he can to entertain and be more family friendly, he has matured over the year and you all need to just back down and put this Aokigahara forest controversy to rest	2
Retro Skill Vlogs 0x0 shut up you ignorant moron. Its sad that you obnoxious fans are still pathetic enough to defend him over the offensive crap he did. And hes not trying to be more family friendly, hes getting away from that.	2
I bet 999,999,999 he's gonna do this again	2
It's called suicide forest and he did a video about it.....	3
In my opinion the suicide victim looked fake. But either way fake or real you shouldnt film it. Besides, all of his content is useless!	2
A year later in 2019 and everyone over the mental age of 13 still hates this guy. I know I will never forgive him for disrespecting the dead, making it harder for YouTubers, and Americans who want to see Japan. This also shows you how much YouTube needs to fix their system because it took them almost a week to take that video down but a few hours to take down a false flagged video? Hopefully that guidelines strike will put some brian cells in his head...oh wait, it didn't.	2
Now 1 year later he jokes about that hes gonna be gay for the month 	3
He was born gay. Nobody cares. He's old news...	0
Oh hi I am he !  	2

Forget my other comment, IDC if I'm late...	0
I hated him even before that video. when I saw that video I was full of anger like 'he can't do that I mean sure he is a YouTube star but he can't film a dead body or something like that. Suicide is a big deal and we don't need anyone dying! #SuicidePrevention #STOP #DONTDOIT #FINDHELP #LetsMakeAChange #OurLivesMatter	2
He didn't show the body. It was blurred out. Stop hiding real life issues that happen in this world.	2
I really hate people who suicides	2
hes probably got subscribers on facebook!!! Get it?	0
Yes because he got a follower on youtube	1
The funniest thing is he saying that he wants to protect the people from suicide but in the video he laughs at the body how dare he because that's Someone's Child like you can shut the video down and call someone call the Japanese police like like what is going inside his head in like going to get so many views because of this video he  it backfired so I don't know what he was thinking but he did the wrong thing	0
You guys don't mess with my f****** Jake  or he 	2
Fernando Ybarra stfu	2
Come on let me tell you japan people actually do wrong thing and suicide themself and stop talking that and fuck you japan for it	2
What's even more enraging is the fact that YouTube didn't give a crap, even though it must have been flagged at least a billion times. he had to take the video down himself.	2
I have no idea what his video was.. but from what little I could learn from this news-report, I can only point out the hypocrisy of a news-agency making this report. Are you making some sort of claim that all your stories have merit, respect people's privacy and feelings, etc?..	0
Do you say that you never have a news story on anything that can be considered a tragedy?.. 	3
do you say that all your stories have value?.. and that you don't let 'likes' (or as you call it 'ratings') affect what you show?.. 	3
I don't know much about ABC News, as I am not from your country, but.. If you do make these claims, I'll call BULLSHIT.. 	2
News broadcasts often ignore important stories because they suspect they might not be popular, while showing stories because of the 'scoop' value.. or the rubber-necking value.,.. and you rarely ask everyone involved if it's okay.. I don't might not know ABS-news, but if you want to claim you never ever showed video or photographs, f.ex. from a war zone.. you know.. a place where people are dying.. (and this would be people who DIDN'T chose it themselves).. because you think it would be important for your ratings..?.. I seriously doubt it... 	3
I remember when I took media studies and learned that 'public interest'- when deciding whether something is news-worthy- meant what was in the public's interest to know.. not.. 'whatever the public might be interested to hear, plus whatever our sponsors and owners wants us to promote'.	0
.. pot.. kettle.. black..	0
dude that guy just said *Got rot in hell* thats scary as fuck	0
Both of them  brothers are fucking idiots	2
how was this already 10 months ago	0
Hey hey hey whats wrong with you guys, isnt right he make video like this. You guys should think carefully, without he this body cannot be found and stay hang in there maybe bocomes bones, and he never make jouke in that video, as you guys can see he shock to see the death body, and he never make a jouke when he saw that body and why you scoding people without wrong reason, and i know its not for publish but at that moment he not know, even that in youtube guiding line. 	2
Why you guys hate him just because he found the death body	3
Guys if know one uploaded a video with a real dead body but he  was the only one who did he wouldnt know so at least give him a chance also just get over with this now, this was ages ago	0
you guys need to focus on your business. Talk about you to talk about something that you guys could pick on cuz that is not your business don't talk about Jake  and don't talk about he because that is respectful and that chooses their mom and dad being being sad and mad at them so you can focus on your business English and cuz of KSI and daddy is like he Jake is a good boy jerk everything when it rains it does not rain so I don't know what you guys are talking about your business and don't not focus on his business	2

This is unbelievable. He is so popular even after all of this. He makes bad music videos too. That suicide victim probably went through a lot. Suicide is not something to mess with. He is so disrespectful to the people and country that I hold so close to my heart, that I feel sad, embarrassed, angered, and horrified after what he has done. Why does he have so much support? He doesn't care for animals (he made a dog ride a zip line which could be fatal if the dog fell out and scared it out of its mind when held up to a baby tiger), he disrespects the culture, religion, and the people of Japan (the suicide video, running around with an octopus arm and fish and leaving on a random taxi, screaming in a temple, etc) and is just stupid on top of that. I really wish that he would just stop. I feel heartbroken when I saw him disrespecting my home, and the most important place in my life. The people who greeted him with smiles and just tried to be nice were just shoved away. They tried being so kind, but he just... I just can't. He's terrible. If he could just stop...	3
 he is a liar!	2
 he is disgusting!  He does not know if that would happen in his family	2
Wait he showed the body!?	0
I don't watch him but I ALREADY think he's dumb because writes apolge say I didn't do it for the views SAYS THE PERSON THAT USES DEAD BODY in the thumbnail	3
Omg other YouTubers have done the same exact thing. In fact I watched the video on LiveLeak, he and his friends were in shock, some people react differently then others do. I do believe the close up shot of the victim probably wasnt the smartest thing to do. 	0
I was not bothered by the video at all, Ive desensitized to death, I worked in the medical field for years, so Ive become use to watching people die even taking their last breath afterwards I even washed the dead bodies. I worked in Hospice care in a nursing home so you have a choice to either get use to it or get another job.	0

parents shouldn't let their kids this guy	2
I believe that everyperson that walks into that forrest is hoping to find a dead body...for excitement or shock value. as far as he showing 'the guy' on tape...he was hyped up and shocked. Time to get over it. We are still allowed to watch those unfortunate souls jumping to their deaths from twin towers 9/11. dead bodies on the news and documentaries. Seeing the face doesnt make it any worse for me. just let it go.	0

At least in Japan culture accept suicides. In Church controlled Middle Aged vulgar and bigoted Europe suicide victims used to have an ignominious burial and the confiscation of the property. Now, at least there is a tribute to those gentle souls who refuse to adjust to the world where the heart must either break to turn to lead.	3

i seriously dont know how youtube allows this dude to keep making content.. i seriously posted just a couple of links to a website and now im banned from youtube for ever this dude posted a vid of a dead body and his channel is still up	2
Thing is that country gave the forest for that reason. Think about it,  there's no nice place to die anyway, but the gvment actually gave the forest as tranquillity, better than in the family house where families are...it sounds mad but they DO leave the dead at the very scene for days and loved ones make a sort of shrine with flowers and cards....HE KNEW HE WOULD FIND ONE..... I dunno if you know, but the Japanese police have a warent for his arrest.....	3
he and jake  both suck	2
I don't get it is his name he  or Jake  and is he human or Roblox	3
That is messed up bro	3
Other people have posted suicides from this forest, more than one suicide video, so why are people jumping all over this fellow? Also when you commit suicide you leave yourself open to those left behind, when you are dead you no longer need protection so what's the big deal?	3
he's he  and he's a disabled human and has fans of stupid 12 year old fans who thinks anything he does is funny even if he is killing people, his 12 year old fans will think that's funny. yep society has gone to hell my friend	2
He is a fucking idiot!	2
THIS ISNT THE REAL  I KNOW!! 	3
some targeted for kids. Life and death issues, people's strange attitudes etc...are just a part of everyday life. To me people tearing living people's lives apart is much worse yet people do it all the time.	3
Myke Plaz he  may not have made a good choice here but people, kids included have access to a lot of horrible things on line these days,	2
how can something positive come from a man who took his own life?	3
Debra Kerkkonen he disrespected a body by joking about it and he didn't cut the part where the dead body is. He knows his audience is full of kids and just shows it.	2

Thats Bullshit he.	2
Debra Kerkkonen yeah his a psychopath. Theres much worser than he  and things accessable to this internet thats unaccessacle. And thats life you might have weird friends or your close family member died	2

I never watched the video so im all good	1
From hearing the comments, you all are such pussies I swear, the jokes weren't even anywhere near as bad as people made them out to be, showing a dead body is a bit graphic but dam its not the end of the fucking world, also he was telling a few MINOR jokes because he was horrified on what he had seen and wanted to feel better, that being said to clear a few things up, I do have a lot of sympathy for the poor man that committed suicide, I'm no he  fan but seriously grow a fucking pair of balls.	2

on YOUTUBE	1
It's not he's fault he found a dead body and nervously laughed about it, he didn't know how to act around a dead body it's his first time and he was nervous and scared.  So stop blaming him he doesn't know how to reacts idiots.  If he wasn't there nothing would have happened but no one would have found the body anyway so I guess he deserved his YouTube Channel back.  Everyone looks up to him but after that video people left him because of that, I feel bad for the guy I mean he looked like he was in tears and depression after of what happened, so please just give him a chance and make his life better by going to his channel and subbing.  He needs all the support he can get by all you hegsters but if you still hate him why comment on his videos anyway? what's the point of hating on him? Just Let his life be and forgot you knew him its that simple.  I am glad for those people seeing this and rethinking about hating on him Let's make this world a better place.  Are you with me? If your not just leave and don't say anything alright?  Don't make this harder than it has to be.	0

he  sucks so baaaaaaaad 	3
intention is important. if suicide was discussed with a matter of fact view with the intention of informing others, it's different than disrespecting a dead man's body to get attention. his apology is bullshit too, he's not sorry at all. he never admit what he did was wrong, he still pretends to act all innocent and a victim in this. it's disgusting	2

If he cared he wouldnt act the way he does . Its about money always ! Hes pathetic and its sad he is an icon . He regret it because he got negative backlash from Hollywood and his publicist and lawyer said apologize.  he  is the biggest popular joke of 2018 and the longest standing april fools joke of all time . His quote ' I get views ' says in itself he didnt care .	2
This is not a growing up experience. This is not a 'mistake'. If no one had called him out on this he wouldn't have felt a shred of remorse. he  is a sociopath and does not deserve a second chance	3

How the fuck does joking about a suicide while in the presence of it spread awareness of it? If anything it's just spreading awareness of how stupid pricks like you shouldn't have access to technology.	2

Ya good for you stupid	0
Hey all...let's all unsubscribe and stop giving him views until he's a ordinary unpopular person .let's teach this tosser a life lesson. Lesson One jakey1. Never ever show a real dead person on any videos or photos where peple will see it.2. y? Cos it will make peple commit suicide more.so let's hang this bait bettling bonker out to dry and see that he loses his career on YouTube and so he can't be taken seriously by the public.hes a rich prick who mocked the dead person and put suicide into a whole new perspective.letz make sure his career is over .He does not deserve to earn so much money.	2
'15 million followers in youtube' don't you mean subscribers. But this is so fucked um why the hell would you even post a fucking picture of a dead person who hanged themself. Also,  he needs to cry himself a river,  build a bridge and get over it. Maybe he could actually get a job instead of making crappy videos with clickbait titles and him dressed in a dumb pokemon onesie.	2
This guy is a piece of shit, thats an all time low for YouTube, UNSUB FROM HIM NOW HES A IDIOT BEYOND BELIEF	2

So you're basically kill your whole family, record them and dab on them like he. Wow that's brutal.	0
he , what a controversal character he is. he does these stupidest things and he needs to stop with it. This video right here is the prime example of why he should not be able to influence people. Like the news caster said ' You may not know your kids are watching this guy.' Like in the Pokemon costume he was walking down the streets of Japan and just mocking the culture that Japan holds so high. How is one going to come into a foreign country and act like that? I am baffled at the audacity of this kid, I would call him a man but... his acts do not hold true to that. If the mocking of the culture was not enough, look at him in the suicide woods.  'We found a dead body', how are you going to make someones death click bait, hold some respect to the man that died. I agree with all the back lash he got, he is trash for what he did. Then to laugh at the fact they just saw a dead body, a body that someone took their own life, clearly they were down in the dumps then you find humor out of that? That is crazy I hope karma comes back and bites him in the ass. His response to all of it was a bunch of B.S, he thought it was hilarious because he is a child with no adult like tendencies, as he makes Youtube videos of things like this. This guy needs to get a life and not one like this. This kid angers me as you can tell.	2
he's done nothing wrong it's not his fault that he went into a forrest and found a dead body	3
I know it was pretty stupid but everyone makes a mistake like if you agree	2
I hope this he douchebag will be forever haunted by ghosts. He is so irresponsible, ignorant and so full of himself.	2

I saw the video when it was uploaded like 3 minutes ago I watched it all It was so disturbing espacilly when he went very close to it filmed the leg and fingers if it and the body he showed the bag of the victim he is a  absolute tash	0
I think people are hating on you far too much. I don't think such hate is fully deserved. However. You went about this video the wrong way bro. Seeing you react with enthusiasm  to such a tragedy was disturbing at best.  But i still don't blame you entirely. I truly believe you are a great guy at heart, that simply got caught up in a situation you didn't know how to handle.  How could you know how to handle it? You aren't a cop. You aren't an EMT. You aren't a fireman. You aren't a news reporter. You are not military.  Do you see where I am going?  You haven't been trained to handle this type of situation. At your age...all the little wires that make up our adult brains haven't even been fully connected yet. You are a very young man that is getting hate which is undeserved.  You are not a bad person because of this. Ya just fucked up. I challenge anybody behind a keyboard to say they haven't fucked up big time....at least once.	2
Send him to a prison in Siberia.	2
Ya know what ABC shush. What he did wasnt okay but your just banking on the problem for money so shush	2
Yeah he's popular and he is an IDIOT, FOOLISH and IGNORANT.	2
To raise awareness? Pshh nope	2
ARE YOU KIDDING ME YOU ARE WORSE THAN YOUR BROTHER!!!!!!  You knew what you were doing you messes up I don't think any one will wach you or your brother WHY WHY WHY would you do some thing that stupid not only your brother bullying the twins and now this I hope your parents are proud 	2

He is fucked up. Not only did he RECORD A DEAD BODY BUT HE WAS WEARING THAT FUCKING STUPID ASS HAT AND FUCKING DISRESPECTED THE FAMILY OF THAT GUY AND HE COMPLETELY DISRESPECTED JAPAN BY FUCKING DOING ALL THAT OTHER DUMB SHIT. HE SHOULD BURN IN HELL Also dont forget all of the ten year olds who now think that suicide isnt a big deal and think it is a joke and think that disrespecting a WHOLE bunch of people is okay and funny... Thanks he. Edit: Also, he put #heg4life at the end of his apology tweet... Yeah.... Smart...	2
ever since I told my friend I was suicidal she kept saying 'You don't wanna end up in a he  video!' and I was like ' true'	3

Life With Aysheh if anyone is rude, it's he. I'm just speaking the truth. I honestly don't get how you can still watch him after the suicide forest video, it was repulsive.	3

Easy to apologize but it hurts then IT REALLY HURTS, what he did is totally disgust and disrespectful Japanese culture and life even in any nations. Don't FUCK around bro!

It is not his fault that he found a dead body. He is the one that didn't know there was actually going to be a dead body, well he might of knew that there was a body, but he didn't know he was going to find one. He deserves the love and R.I.P the dead body ;c	3
atpanlilio dude, he went to a spot where people actually goes to kill them selves and of course something is going to happen, he knew what was about to happen you dumb fuck head.	0
atpanlilio it's called SUICIDE forest what did he expect!?	3
atpanlilio bitch if you dont stfu imma slap your stupid ass upside down bitch nigga	2
Ah yes, coming into a forest known for being a place where people in utter distress and depression come to take their final breath. No way a body could have been found there.	2
If you walk into a place called suicide forest, youre either there to commit suicide, or see the evidence of someone who committed suicide. People dont go into that forest just for hiking and picnics. So, yeah..... its all on him.	3
NO NO NO PLZ DON'T HATE ME EVEN THOUGH I ABUSE KIDS FOR MONEY AND USED A CORPSE FOR VEIWS NO NO NO	2

Must See	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMjCY-urxvg	2
he went to the forest knowing that there could possibly be someone dead in there and once he finds the body he keeps filming. He can fuck off and so can social media its turned people into brain dead zombies.	2
I don't like  him	2
 omfg...	2
Guys, he's just never been to Japan before. He didn't know what outcome could come out of this. He doesn't know how people do things there. I don't support he  or jake , but hear me out. He needs a second chance. I know not all of you are christians, but again, hear me out. One of God's rules was to forgive someone, even if they had done something wrong. So... plz forgive him...	3
HEHEHE IM A FAT KING ummm how about... 	0
Great way to start 2018 this and the Florida shooting	2
I watched the video, and he  seemed had good intentions concerning letting people know Suicide is not the answer. However, the way is was taught was not the best.  Americans must understand that what others consider sacred or of great delicate matter, should be respected	3

Kylie Reagan Yeah ok , its clearly what hes doing he was even LAUGHING at it and your saying He didnt know what to do. Even I forgive that he did the SAME type of shit with the dead, tasing dead rats pathetic. I dont know what is wrong with you supporting a person like he doesnt care about you he just want you to the buy his merch hopefully you see through your foolish ways and open your eyes. Once you do something people are going to talk about it forever especially with that fake apology and evil acts.	2
Did they have a new update again	0
(Joke)	2
He should've yelled ESKITET	3
*cLiCk ThAt FoLlOw BuTtOn*	1
People are making more terrible videos! There are people who spend 24 hours in stores and thats illegal! Your getting mad at him for spreading awareness! Your so selfish! He just wants people to be happy and live good and just be proud that in life that you have made it is this far!	2
People spend years to become like a nurse and earn (I don't know but just a guess) 43,000 a year. Now this piece of shit makes a video for views and gets millions, what is our life coming to. I know he said that he was sorry but he is still a little scumbag.	2
Dont come to Japan forever.	3
Guys. Stop saying such stuff about he. He made a mistake, i get it. But guess what. THATS WHAT MAKES US HUMAN. If WE never made mistakes and spread awareness, who would?	2
My uncle committed suicide you dont understand what it would feel like to lose a loved one so you can shut up kid	2
You seriously believe this video was some kind of PSA?? And yes, we all make mistakes. We all have to pay the price for them, too. This is his price, so he and his fandom just have to accept it. Its the same price anyone in entertainment has to pay when they make a mistake in judgement. Hes no different.	2
Abbii Draws that's like saying its OK and just a mistake if a terrorist came and murdered half a town.	3
he is not, and will not be forgiven. Though I do agree it's his *Biggest* mistake ever.	2
Shut the fuck up youre too young to understand	2
Followers	1
If he wanted to raise awareness he should have not uploaded that video but filmed a more serious video addressing the topic instead of discussing it just because of the situations he encountered.	2
AT LEAST HE SAID SORRY YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO UNSUBSCRIBE JUST BEACUSE A MISTAKE NO YOU GUYS ARE RHE NASTY ONES IF YOU HAVE HIS SHIRT THROW IT AWAY THEN BECAUSE IF YOU DONT LIKE he  GET TF OUT THIS WORLD	0

Disappointing behavior towards A suicide Victim, it is never funny when a life is lost. I've came across countless individuals with the same attitude, some are even friends I had who are spoiled or experienced family issues. Don't get me wrong, I don't know he  personally, it's the behavior he proved that is always familiar. Some never change, some remain. Stupidity is like a disease caught from bad leadership or 'IDOLS' and causes immaturity, spreading dumb actions and no sense of respect and honor for others or themselves.. But most of us learn from our wrong, I still have hope for the hopeless and restless. Even though he was wrong, I hope he learns, and that everybody will leave him at peace.	3
Why is he still a youtuber?	3
R.I.P to the late victim.Hitotsu no ai, and condolences to the family.	3

Wrong, if you watch TFIL's video of how they went to suicide forest, they clearly saw things. And yes they posted the video but, they didn't show the bodies. And if they did one it's because they didn't see them and two they would blur it out or not even show it in the first place. Btw if you want to see it then go to TFIL and look for the video description of 'OVERNIGHT AT SUICIDE FOREST (warning: incredibly scary)'. That video is 59 min long so you might take a while. And I advise you to watch it in the daytime.	3
Yeah raise awareness for suicide and stuff while making a joke out of it. It's just contrasting	2
Scary	0
I dont like he  now fuck him	2
Bullshit he is. He only said that cos his intent didnt take the best of turns and the outcome he wanted which was idk but not to prevent or raise awareness. Dumbass ytuber. Hope his so called success ends in a very fiery way	2
Why he i was a maverick	3
Huh.. I'm...NOT SCARED!!!  Jake  shows up, OH GOD NO!	2
Son of a ass bitches just because he apologized it doesn't mean the family of the suicidee is going to automatically accept the apology since the dead person was broadcasted to the public via the video he  has posted.	0
he is a pure idiot I agree	2
I really don't like that guy in the first place.	2
I LOVE HER GREY SHIRT SO MUCH!!!!!	1
Who will kill them self to be in Jake  video	3
Nobody	2
Hydro Hero not me	3
I am a 17 year old who has had a brush with suicide, I saw the original video, I saw that he was trying to raise awareness even if it was not in the most effective way. The video should have been taken down, However he should not have lost his YouTube page, and parents you should not blame he for your inability to keep tabs on what your kids whatch, it is possible with a little effort to monator what your kids watch. hes video does not offend me, what does is the celebritys and news personalitys and some just normal people acting like they know anything about suicide. If you knew anything about suicide, and had any first hand experience with it you would know it teaches you to be more careful when you use hurtful words, because you dont know what is going on in peoples life, and it could be your comment that pushes them over the edge...and that includes YouTube and social media comments. Take a lesson from this comment I expressed myself and shared my opinion, without telling anyone to go die in a hole or that they are a bad person.	3
Slurp Juice TF? Why on the earth will someone fake a suicide? You are disgusting	0
Slurp Juice bitch shut the fuck up 	2
Hammerschlgen M That's funny, i just saw someone's comment on how people should suicide and all who did suicide are weaklings. He/She even argued that the dead guy's family in Jake's video are happy that the guy died...	3
Im seeing a pattern here.	0
Hammerschlgen M just leave this person alone. He did nothing.	2
Well turns out everyone was wrong about he. The suicide wasn't even real and the police even admitted to the local press that the whole thing was staged. I put their statements into my playlist if you need to research. So everyone can back off and leave he alone. It's not his fault everyone fell for the poorly acted and scripted vlog. It was so fake how is everyone that DUMB	3
WHAT THE ACTUAL FREAK	0

I know the video of the forest was dumb but it doesn't mean you can give negative reviews everyone makes mistakes even I do I regret a lot of them and I'm a kid and probably you won't listen to me because you think Kids are dumb and don't review AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE AND I was depressed for 3 years because of bullying and almost committed death but then I thought if I died I couldn't see everyone and everything I loved so when he posted sure it was dumb but it was A MISTAKE SO STOP IT YOU ALL HATERS	2
Seriously your a special kind of stupid aren't ya 	2
Why cant you just reply to a single comment?	2
Ohh the children are watching! The children, the children. But the children. Haha.	0
THis shit is fake or what. This shit is fake. Didn't even see the suicide guy.	2
There are many documentaries on YouTube about the suicide forest. His video was really no different except for that it was real, in the moment and unscripted. Facing our own mortality makes us feel scared and vulnerable. I think it bothered people so much because it felt as if we were there experiencing this discovery ourselves. There were parts when he acted like an immature jackass, but he and the others were respectful in regards to the deceased. He should stop being slammed so hard by the world and media or he may feel so ostracized as to consider suicide himself.	3
Why did he do that 	3
Edgy my fatass what if that was someone you loved hanging and this dumb fuck laughed and cracked jokes and put your love all over YouTube to seeso you can shut the hell up and sit the fuck down	2
Why do you keep bringing up your fatass? And who the hell was cracking jokes about it? Obviously everyone is upset with it. Hahaha	2

But did ABC News seriously just show two television stars' twitter posts as if they are the most important people who have something to say about this matter? Wow, thanks. How else would we know what a self-absorbed piece of shit this guy is without the important feedback of television actors and actresses?	3
hes not intelligent	2
I think I'm not in the heg Amy more	3
At least he is raising awareness that this is what people go through and this is the real world he is truly trying to make a difference in the world	1
Hey news fuck you he didn't  mean to show a dead body	2
Your a jerk	2
Youre * dumbass. Hahahaha	1
No no no no no no no he	3
At least He Apologized,Just Hop Off Him,I really Dont Understand Whats Going On Cause I Barley Even Hear About he	3
Child fuckers in Hollywood and everywhere else seems to be a problem but no one wants to tackle that one because every mother fucker that you know is going to be outed as a child fucker. I will not live in a world where fucking children is okay. I am okay with suicide. I understand why any good soul would want off of this god damned planet. Man is a despicable, worthless, pathetic, heartless sack of shit with no intention of doing anything good on this planet. This place is a fucking joke.	2
Its better to leave the body alone	1
Everyone unsubscribe he he  does not deserve no more subscribers	2
Hahaha. You tell em.	2
I really dont know what was wrong with the video. You commit suicide in a very popular place known for suicides and yet we are shocked if someone discovers it and post it. People took it the wrong way. There are videos of worse things on YouTube but this gets people all hyper and offended!!	3
ABC doesnt know shit! All they do is talk shit	2
No no,it was an accident! He didn't know how to react! But you are half right. Sadly	3
What are you doing this again test why tell me why	3
I HATE he  AND JAKE 	2
Type louder please.	2
hes a creep and his apology was the least honest thing i ever watched.	0
Guys he did not quit YouTube	2
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES stop hating on he and he 4 LIFE	0
I'm not mad that he found a dead body, shit happens	0
What I'm mad about is that he had the audacity to record, edit, upload and LATER remove it and apologize NOT for the incident, but because he was sick of the backlash, people like him I loathe	2
I wonder how hes life is going by posting that video of he in the suicide forest and all his fans who hate him now	3
OMG BUT I AM STILL A heGER	3
I watch the video	0
I watch him	0
I love he vedeo	1
I hope that man who committed suicide is in peace. 	3
That video was unacceptable. 	2
My friends didn't understand the video. They thought he committed suicide, but actually he was hiding away from the people who know what he did.	3
I can't believe my friends even watch his videos. He is a horrible person.	2
Woah, sorry to break de angry vibe but my dog just came running when i on my Gorillaz CD on	2
Bullshit mistake my fatass your sorry because you got your ass ripped off and handed to your fucking retarded ass that that woman needs slapped in the damn mouth as well wow just wow you the bitch and everyone else that was laughing should have a bloody ass mouth	2

Yes. A subscriber is a follower. Dumbass	2
Fuck you im still watching him	2
Never watched a single video of his in full, and just seeing these clips is giving me whiplash lol	0
Stop just stop yeah he did a very big mistake but he didn't mean it ok people are like that so just stop	2
I didn't see the video, but I know what he did was wrong. He should be punished but anyway, everyone deserves a second chance.	1
this loser should of thought of what he had done.NOT COOL	2
To make my personal opinion a bit shorter, I'd like to say that killing a monster will only make ourselves a monster in the end. Though I do feel a deep hurt for the man who had taken his life, and only hope to never imagine the pain he had most likely been going through during his last moments of living, I encourage people to forgive. What I don't stand for is the idea that we should forget this whole situation. he performed a horrific, inhumane act, but we can't tell him to rot in hell like Aaron  did, as that encourages suicide. It doesn't matter how narrsasistic, rude, and prideful someone is, they can still become depressed. Though I do not hate nor support he, I would like to forgive. We shouldn't hate, we should educate.	1
Can people shut up and leave him alone dude stop trying to mess up his life bro you guys suck!	2

June Moon lmao isnt u like 7	0
June Moon firstly retake your spelling test and second,  his whole channel should be taken down and then he can actually get a job that doesn't involve making vids with a trashy clickbait title.	2
Shows how much the dead person thought of the people that would find him.  One thing is for sure this young man  he and those who were with him will never forget that imagine. They may need therapy. No one thinks of them.	1
Yes, He has 15 million followers.	1
He didn't do it to 'raise awareness of suicide.' He did it to increase prifit fir himself by getting views from gullible children and adolescents. The apology was a farce to smudge over the matter in the hope YouTube would still pay him for the clicks on the video.	3
Well from what I have seen this guy he  was not joking about the body and he literally went into shock during this video. He's only 22 and shouldn't have his life destroyed over it.  I am sure someone will make a documentary on this suicide forest and it will be on t.v. sometime soon. It is a wake up call to the world as to what happens in other part of the world.	0
Everybody makes mistakes	0
When someone finds a dead body and finds it comical while loading up pics of the dead body on youtube, for money. Wow, just wow! Must be hard on his parents seeing their son do something so eerie.	0
He is just such an idiot!!!! His apology is just him trying to fix his image!!!	2
He just didn't know how to react	0

He stopped making vids too	3
Just made fun of something so terrible. He acted like a fool at the expense of those that must have suffered to resort to suicide. The parents, relatives and friends that also suffer when someone takes their life.  He went into an area where suicide is common and he dressed like a fool and when he came upon a victim, he still acted like a fool. Now he says he was trying to bring awareness to the subject of suicide--PURE BS. He continued to act like a fool after the authorities arrived. This suicide was a tragedy and this fool made light over this shocking and troubling act. he , go away.	3
this means there is 15 million fucking idiots out there	2
I need link. I coundnt find in youtube	3

Pretty scary that so many young and impressionable kids watch him and want to model their own lives after his. What he did was WRONG. those of you defending Him do realize that he filmed an actual DEAD BODY, correct? That wasnt just a prop or a cloth dummy. That was an actual person. Someone who had hopes and dreams but felt so lost and unsure that they figured the only way to deal with their pain was Suicide. This is NOT a joke. Put yourself in the shoes of the family of this person he filmed. Think about how you would feel if you happened to see a video of some dumbass in a toy story hat goofing off and having fun while your loved one dangled from a tree above him. Think about how youd feel knowing some rich and conceited shithead posted a video of your dead family member dangling from a tree, so he could get views and gain attention. Because thats exactly why he did this. It wasnt an accident or a mistake. He intentionally made this video and posted it, knowing the consequences of his actions and not giving a shit. Hes only apologizing because he got caught and hes terrified thats he going to lose subscribers/fans. Hes scared stiff because hes losing endorsements/publicity deals. He made this choice of his own free will to do something so shitty. No one forced him to. This is all on him.	3

as much as this breaks my heart, you guys we need to think. he has impacted many kids lives. He basically brings the joy out of our children and siblings, etc. We cant just bash him because he has made one mistake. We all make mistakes. We all deserve second chances. I personally always chose he over any youtuber because he just has a side that will make you smile all day. Im sorry if anyone feels that my opinion is false or unclear but this is just how i feel. I hope the rest of the world can understand.	3

Absolutely not!	2
Gghgh ZzBnbv I think not	2
he  needs to quit YouTube	2
he pual sucks	2
This whole 'he ' controversy so clearly comes off as a fake set up schemery for whatever reasons. Especially with all the major media outlets covering and helping publicize this even more than it already is. And those of us who know, know who truly controls and owns the media. 	2
YouTube has became a major platform that the presstitues and Jews see fit for use of their propaganda. With the increase of the Internet and the web, TV is becoming less of a thing. And they know that. And when they cannot brainwash the masses with TV anymore, they will use the Internet/YouTube. And that is what they are doing. 	2
I would suppose that they are doing this to crackdown and censor the freedom of YouTube/web. The video clearly appears staged, bunch of actors smiling, worst of all, the 'body' clearly appears fake and stiff, as a dummy. What is scarier is that seemingly 99.9% of the people are gobbling this story up with zero question. I have to remember though that the majority of people still trust their government/media and live inside the legendary symbolic reality called the *matrix*. They are not ready to be unplugged.	3
kid is a fucking loser, go hang yourself bitch boy	2

WuPiDu 	1
First of all, just because he was making a lot of money that doesn't make him a celebrity or famous!! I didn't even know who he was before this and neither did other people that I talked to!! Only one out of eight people knew who he was!! When you are a celeb, AT LEAST 9 out of 10 people know who you are by name!! he didn't even come close!!	2
Also not many sane people would want to hire a person with the morals of Satan like he!! Mocking dead people just for views is morally repulsive in anyone's book.. well.. except for he's!!!!	2
Samantha Copeland he will probably be your investment banker...then make a youtube video of stealing yours and other peoples money to a country with no extradition 	0

Boy was I wrong	0
this hole issue is stupid. ppl die everyday, they went to a place that is known for ppl going to die y wuldnt they expect to actually see sumthng. y isn't the place they went to under scrutiny? or the government ther that is openly nd knowingly allowing ppl to go into this forest to die. wake the f up death is apart of life. it happens u shuldnt shame ban or hate sum1 cuz they saw / recorded a dead person. ther dead they don't care.	2

Did they take the video down?	0
His channel is done I feel sorry for him	3
Yeah i know he apologized. But still, not a good idea to make a video about it. I wouldn't have even commented on it i would just report it to the authorties. It could be apart of a murder case or something. Personally i think he should get banned for it. It's pretty offensive because i've witnessed death before, from someone close, and if i found out he just took a picture of that person and voiced it on you tube, i'd be pissed i'd file charges. At the very least he might get banned for it. Because that's pretty serious. I hope he learned his lesson though.	3
