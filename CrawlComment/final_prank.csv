@Pixies Laje let me tell you how it is, they aren't really like that. They just act that way because they know their audience are children.

I hope i cleared your mind on how the world of youtube really works.	2

@Joey Nichols your 15 years old?	0
@Jon Levi idk I kind of like cuddling, and a little more than cuddling if you know what I mean. Lol don't mean to be over the top but I got some personal needs too. I just sometimes don't like how I would have to spend a lot of my time comforting another person and spending loads of money on them. Depends on your partner though. I'd have girlfriends in the past who were quite lenient with me and my free time, while others would be a headache and not even let me spend time with friends and stuff.	0
no over drama nothing at all...  unloke other girls with so little makeup she looks much more cute than other youtuber girls... but the most important aspect of her is her attitude and expression .... her whole approach makes this video epic.... #relationshipgoals	2

I feel so bad about infidelity. but i am glad Mr James was able to help me get all this information, you can contact him via Gmail (worldcyberhackers) or whatsApp : +12678773020	3

1 Question why was he holding a knife saying I just want to talk. And I was talking to my sister and I said *if she opens the door and he has the knife and he walks in and just stabbed Brittany *	3
Change the channel name so dumb	0
He had a knife?! 	0
Im subscribed and I like every one of yall a videos hahaha. I want my name up thereee.  Even if I dont get my name up there I want yall to know that I appreciate YOUUU.  I love yall so much.	0
Good prank!! But man his face melted my heart. Such a great love he has for her, that they have for each other. But man this went beyond the line. Even Nate was like damn, do I even know her? for like a solid 2 seconds lol 	3
But for real, the fact that this does happen to people is whats so sad. People are actually this cruel to do this to another human being and cheat. Those people fucking suck. And Cheating is NEVER OK. Just break up with the person and then fuck whoever you want. Let the other person just move on from you instead of dealing with this trauma and possibly developing ptsd. Yeah, its THAT traumatizing as you just saw - and it wasnt even real!- Cheating isnt and will NEVER be excusable. Get that STRAIGHT.	3
He's so cuteee when he said I just want to talk but with a knife in his hand he is so brave no ONE misses with his stuff	3
I wish to be the fan of the week	3

These are too fake now	0
See these type of pranks can and do break YouTube relations, so many thought would never break up, like 2018 was known as the year of the YouTube couple break up, but they were relentless pranksters all the time or, life happened, don't go down the doing these type of pranks, I know ur solid but they are bad. I've never been one for energy stuff, but u put negatively out there u can see when matters of heart get broken.but nate still managed to edit a video that was hard for him,and did it with style, but don't go down that route. That energy of feeling he had doesn't just disappear and it why repeated pranksters have problems. She is genuinely a sweet person which does make a difference to mean of heart	0
I actually started crying when he teared up. Omg that shows how much he loves her. Damn we all need a bf like him	3
