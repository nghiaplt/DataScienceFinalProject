Why do I still care about this its 2020
 just casually replacing all the emojis with my MEXICAN skin colot lol
Hes still a jackass
2020 anybody. Now here is my question. Y'all hate Logan for making a video in a forest of dead people, and posting it to YouTube. Y'all love Dababy right. He kills people, but y'all still love him. So. Y'all mf are confusing asf
How selfish it is he did it for views 
That was 2 years ago?!
Feels like yesterday man :(
Ikrrr I remember when it just happened
why am I watching this in 2020?????????
Logan is a fucking lier
I WANT TO WATCH THIS DELETED VIDEO!
MrBeast kept on talking about Logan Paul so I had to do this.
Any1. In 2020??
2 years ago... time flies.
Yall know theres a video of this forest where they show dead bodies-
Dumb way to do that.... that was pretty scummy guy, not gonna lie. 
Honestly he didnt do something that bad
Hi zombie.
Why am I watching this in 2020?
i saw that video
15 million FOLLOWERS on yOuTuBe
Trump young
Logan should be banned from youtube. He is beyond disgusting.
to anyone who sees this comment and is feeling helpless and suicidal ,this is for you, please goto my channel and type " GOD'S LOVE FOR YOU" that is how much Father loves  u x
2020?
Im back
2 years later.....
Why am I watching this in 2020
People got mad at him but watched it what did they think they were  going to see followers were just as bad for watching it wasnt like he was at Disneyland you go to a haunted house you see scary stuff not mickey mouse so you go to suicide forest what you think you might see just dont understand people when you go on you tube to watch something n it says city dump your going to see trash learn to read what you watch n you might not get your feelings hurt
I get that he made a BIG mistake but the fact that he cant post a lot like he used to because of this (Im not a fan of him but its kinda sad)
Stop framing him for stuff he did not do
For the love of God and the whole human species please, do not reproduce.
Hello my fellow 2020ians
15 million "followers" on youtube
But the question is why would he even think  of going  back there and staying  that
I want to see that video
HOLY SHIIT Its been two years already...
YouTube isnt a babysitter
I saw the video and it took me time to figure it out and then I realized when my friend told me I was like ohhhhh
What has the world come to people making fun of this man like if you think the world should be a better place
Why am I back here
BatmanKid299 ditto
If you go to aokigahara, please visit to pay respect to the deceased. Not this. Never this.
15 million "FOLLOWERS???" On youtube
I love Logan paul
He really isn't a "YouTube star" but ok.
you can say that he is now HANGING
Pew army? 
People doesnt know him, he laughs when he is confused, or in an awkward situation and doesnt know what to do. He did not think about it and how everyone got angry and of course he would never take a picture of a dead person without bluring it. And yes he tried to make a positive video of what a bad problem suicide is and why its not the right way to end your life.
Japan has the least homicide rate but the largest suicide rate.
Old peolple 15millon follows hhajja subcribers
Nobodycareswhatyearyourin
Why they say 15 million followers on YouTube
Coz he only have 15 million followers that time
Logan Paul only cares about money
Why would u do such a horrible thing this isn't a joke ur disrespecting someone who took there own life
ASSHOLES by Aaron James paperback book
He should have post it in bestgore
hej i dont care what he did all of us make a mastek but you are saing it like logan was the firt guy in the world hou shoud a dead bodi on vidiv
 so shat ta fuck up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ,,.,,,  and you are baiscy destroing him . his fodher olmost bit him up for  what hi did so you are not sopoustu bery him in the world of internet
You're an idiot.
Its called subscribers
I would like to say she said YouTube followers
2019?
The top comments crack me up 
I used to watch him all the time and thought about this and came back. I didn't even see this on YouTube I saw this on the new and when I got to YouTube it was already gone
Edit: Kinda got mad when he started replacing maverick with kong
 man fuck you
15 million followers on YouTube !!! Hah
This just made him more famous lol
A growing up experience? He's a grown man you idiots.
No Newfriends Bro, shut up.. Your brain finally starts to fully develop for men at the age of 25. For females its in there early 20s. Stop talking shit!
Well some people grow up in they 20s, but most people grow up till they're 18
No Newfriends nice
I can't believe it's been almost two years now
1 year later he's a bigger dick now, "I didn't do it for views, I get views."
Logan Paul - ends up on news
Deji - nothing happens
Yeah to be honest dont mock him. He will kill himself for being mocked by the whole internet.
Good. I hope he does.
Whos coming with me in the dark
I didn't watch his video and I don't really get what happened..but.. i don't know what is so bad about that video. people die every day, there is already too much people on this planet. and what do we do? nothing. we just fucked everything up. we are the reason our planet is dying, we are the reason why everything is dying. i sometimes wish people go extinct.
@Your friendly neighbourhood emo disappointment lol
Aight edgelord
The fact that you have no context to your edgy comment makes this worse because you have no proof to back your claim up
This is shit fuck ABC news
We all make mistakes. Forgive him. He still brings joy to your day! It's not like you never did something wrong. SMD
@Wlfclud AJ Like I said Raghu Seetharaman is a pussy who will never admit he's wrong or that he lost.
@Raghu Seetharaman Did you just dab? That's so fucking stupid and doesn't help your side of the story. Logan Paul showing a dead body, laughing at it, doing other messed up shit  (like throwing plates and leaving the shards of glass for his dog to step on), is not okay. Think of how their family felt, seeing their dead loved one hanging from a tree on YouTube. Movies and video games are different, those characters do not exist in the real world. This was a real issue and you are not right in any way. The fact that you would support Logan and his terrible decision to go into the Suicide Forest, and especially his decision to FILM it when he knew he'd find at least one person dead, is fucked up. Maybe if you were a part of the victim's family, you'd understand the pain and horror they went through when seeing this video. That enough to get you to stop defending yourself because you know you're wrong?
@thePRUH!!!! rofl
@Your friendly neighbourhood emo disappointment pussies won't ever admit they're wrong.
@Raghu Seetharaman Lol, your ignorance has lead to your own demise. Checkmate
This is how much followers he lost
Only 21?
Should be more
Don't u love it when they have 15m followers on YouTube
I wanna watch the video to make fun of logan too bad I never got the chance to
Why are people mad about it?
15million FOLOWERS on YOUTUUUBEEE WHAT U MEAN SUBSCRIBERS
What is so bad that he did?
"what Logan Paul did WAS funny" Explain that to the mans family.
@Hdhshxhs Whenever your definition is, I don't really care but someone else would probably shit fury on you.
@Joe Feigenbutz well clearly it was, I was being sarcastic. If you can't tell that then you are the daft one.
Besides, what Logan Paul did WAS funny 
The point is people here don't know you so they can't tell if you are joking. Saying "Can you take a joke?" sounds like a cop out.
@Joe Feigenbutz What is your point?
Yo..6.99mil subscribers for this channel..nice
Could you actually see the body
Did they say 15 million FOLLOWERS????? Its YouTube not instagram
I saw this on the news I didn't know this male
Random woman: he has 15 million followers on YouTube
Wait...thats illegal
China: We have the worst tourists
America:  Hold my beer
can you still find this vid online anywhere?
Hes such a fukn douchebag. Only people follow him making him rich.......... douchebags
Aaron Paul talking tough 
An apology isnt gonna cut it! Raise awareness for suicide by not mocking someone who has taken their own life 
I cant believe he actually did that! My sister committed suicide and I dont even get how someone can think of doing something like that. Not only showing a dead body but visiting a place called The Suicide Forest. What was he thinking?
Logan is such a spectacular douche.
In fact, Japan is suicide country.
Japanese people are  Looking away.
Not so much looking away as we are grateful to have been Problem presentation.
An uncivilised and uncouth American tourist.
What a piece of shit. Screw you Logan Paul...
Why do yall talk behind peoples back
Fuck I wanted to watch it
Suicide should not be frowned upon. Actually, more people should consider it.
James Charles: MY CAREER! WHERE'S IT GONE
Logan Paul: Welcome to my world
I like him. Let it go. We need to talk about suicide.
@I'm an ordinary person who like s agreed
LOGAN PAUL. GET CHO ASS OVA HERE SO I CAN FRIDHWBBW SLAP THAT SMUG FACE OF YOUR HEAD.
Logan paul, he is legend
He and his minions are going to ROT IN  HELL. 
He did for views hes just a idiot
Hes just a big jackass
Bro just stop
ya bitch why you fucked up yo logan paul
He has 15 million FOLLOWERS on YouTube does she know YouTube at all? =(
Followers/subscribers. Same thing man
I lIkE mInEcRaFt
- Joji
I'm glad ksi won
Every time my boyfriend gets drunk my anus feels like it wants to commit suicide. :. (
Im Japanese/white and this makes me horrified. I wish him good and I hope he goes through some major MAJOR karma. Im sorry Logan, but you did this to yourself.
Damn ass Logan
Did she say.....f-fifteen million FOLLOWERS on YOUTUBE
Logan Paul: YO WE FOUND A DEAD BODY
Also Logan Paul: I meant to strike positivity and raise awareness
Tbh Its not Really his Fault We all make mistakes;-; Ans they Fr gotta deal with it
Did he have to upload it
Who is here after watching Akash barmon channel?
Ironic since the news and media exploit and sensationalize similar to logan paul
Nah ksi is better
Logan Paul: *looks at himself*
Also Logan Paul: *I'm gonna end this man's whole career*
Saw it before it got taken down
That's fake news.
Bullshit that forest has been on tv
This is why I dont like Logan Paul! Hes a really bad person!!!
how can you think its okay? this guy was in pain and they mocked the death by making light of the situation. 
I don't think money or success is always given to people who could do the right thing with it.
I can never take anything serious when Logan Paul is in it..
Someone beat the shit out of this imbecil
Logan and jake is retarded
Looks like ANOTHER AMERICAN ASSHOLE
I searched up guy dodging a dodgeball and this showed up
LOOOL, that man doesn't know how famous he got after his death xD
Logan Paul could go back into forest & shoot himself for a YouTube video.  That would raise suicide awareness.  And help the gene pool.
Id never let my kid watch the Paul brothers, or any of Team 10.  They are NOT kid friendly in the slightest. Good or bad,, Views are views for him.
Im just trying to find the original clip
Vai Brasil
The original video was taken down by YouTube for obvious reasons 
But the Comments for that video where saltier than the Pacific ocean
TheCircle and theres a reason for that.
Logan Paul:I will be the best youtuber ever
Dangly senpai:imma end his career
They should have arrested the scum, he harassed people in the streets of Japan
Followers in youtube guys
Lol, ABC is stupid. "15 million FOLLOWERS on Youtube" ITS CALLED SUBSCRIBERS. LMAO
I seriously don't get people who commit suicide.. ending your life for stupid reasons.. how more stupid can someone be. THIS IS WRONG.
How young are you?
Why does the news channel always fucking saying followers on YouTube
Logan should delete his channel cause he got beaten by ksi
Did she just say followers on youtubers
News anchor is sure impressed by how much he owns
Just remembered this vid and I was like huh wonder where that body came from
First off it's absolutely amazing that anyone would watch a complete f****** moron like this guy. He's never worked a day in his life could care less about anything but himself and makes millions of dollars doing nothing. I bust my ass and do this every single day for real I stand in the middle of forest beings every single day. I have 20,000 still pictures from live video of these creatures. This is a Bigfoot Forest it's amazing how f****** stupid all of you are there's no other way to say it. You're all brainwashed and you don't even know it if you want to see real stop by. Freaking amazing how dumb people
He honestly has a lot more to apologize about than just this. Not saying this is nothing because I saw that video he peosted and I dont understand how he could have by any means thought it to raise awarness. Its disrespectful to the family and to the person who unfortunately took their own life. He was obviously going to get an uproar from this because its sickening. Being someone whos dealt with suicide and attempts multiple times both very person and first hand, it made me furious when he posted it ti have a laugh with hus friends as I knoe it infuriated many other people as well. He has caused so much damage, done so many wrong things that apologusing isn't enough, he's a horrible person for thinking half of the things hes done is ok, I just wish he would actually think before he did...
Stupid logan Paul fans still supporting him after this
Block him and bring Bart Baker backkkkk
WTF why did he even do that tweet out stuff instead of putting footage of suicide and dead bodies on a app that kids watch
He deserved worst then death
I'm talking about Logan of course
i. Am not a fan of logan but he does definitely not deserve to die.
yeah i hate him too
He posted the video for suicide awareness but laughs in the video
Nigga
Who came here just to actually rewatch the actual video he made
Me bitch...
Hate him
In what world Is it okay to film a dead body. ON YOUTUBE? WHERE KIDS CAN SEE THIS
Who else got triggered when she said He has 15M follower on YouTube instead of Subscribers
Go find your safe space kid.
Dead man: oh I'm good
who remember this
like if you do
That's discusting like i freaking had a nightmare of that because of how disturbing it was. Who tf thinks its okay to show a dead body and laughs about it
He has got 20 million subscribers now, so perhaps it was a good idea after all.. lol
Fuck u #  
Who with this in 2020
Anybody should care why?
I laughed my ass of the first time i saw it on tv tbh :) The irony is to good
It has been an year since this disgusting incident happened and I still diss him for what he has done....
      
I hope he will catch on fire into ashes
Whose here after lsi v logan paul rematch
      
I'd give anything to record myself killing him and then post a video of his body for 5 minutes.
Wow, I bet people would love to see footage of me, an absolute moron, filming a dead body inside of a forest.
Almost 2 years ago
Ahh, Adrienne Bankert. She used to be the traffic girl in Sacramento, KCRA. 
God I hate this gay brother duo
thay targets teenagers and children?
wow that's pretty gay
@Darkrai -8 years old and I already won this award?!?
wow u called them gay??! What an insult. Best insult of the year goes to this 8 year old kid on the internet
I did see the video.  It must have been bad.  I dont think filming is terrible but it all about the tone and how things are said.  IMO.  Im curious now how the video was
She said he has 15 million followers, its subscribers not followers.
Whyamiwatchingthisin2019
Hes raising the suicide awareness system?
True, cause no one wants logan paul to film you dead and make money of of your own corpse.
Also, why am I here?
Who the fuck cares seriously? Fuck the world has become a bunch of pussies
Lol what an edgy kid
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say the dead mans family probably cares.
WTFFF
2:16 anyone saw the fhrintp Guy????
S eu que vim pelo vc sabia?
15 million followers on YouTube its subcribers
i hate this b$#*
Kids.. stop making stupid people famous.. wtf.
logan paul boi better
Logan paul: "I didnt want veiws or to harm anyone" 
Also Logan paul: "HAHAH A DEAD BODY" 
My dog Logan: "This is a discrace to my name"
Hey your named after my neighbor's hairless cat *that cat doesn't look good I think your the cat*
His apology is not sincere and he make the video to make money and when he say sorry it not true   he look at the computer for he channel not destroy
Schnitzels!!
That is messed up, I would call the police jeez
Welp im here bcuz of the video 'Suicidal Forest full documentary' and most of the comments r like from Logan Paul stuffs. Bruhv idk why but im pretty offended there-
Whos here after KSI vs Logan?
15 million FOLLOWERS on YouTube agh the pain
Who here after the fight
Fuck Sophie and arun i love my boy and im not a kid im a 19 year old
Ok boomer
Who is here after the second ksi vs logan paul fight?
Aaron paul was my hero back then and he still is today 
If you didn't do it for the views then whytfyoupostedit
Boot asss click Bait had me think it was the real video
CBS F U
You illiterate fuck.
Whos here after Logan got smacked by KSI who ended his career at last.
Wouldn't the left claim this to be a hate crime? They're race obsessed.
Logan did not get smacked by ksi. It was a split decision, and if Logan retained his 2 points, he would have won.
Yeah - pretty sure his career will survive tho. Split decision and scored the bigger knock down....not like he got devastatingly finished....
Wasnt it a tie tho? Just wondering.
I remember Being the 3rd view I was so happy now I hate him 
Whos here after KSI ended this mans career in November 2019
they both got paid
who here after ksi beat his ass?
Who else is here after KSI beat him? 
hes literally a sociopath, if this was the only thing he ever did wrong, then ok. But hes been shitting on his neighbors lives for 15 years. He will eventually be murdered or put in jail.
Hi Bye lol they have the same score dumb so no one beats him even ksi didn't beat him cause they have the same score DUMB
Destiney dont check My profile Stfu you fucking virgin he won dumbass go watch the vid idiot 
Hi Bye ksi didnt beat him they took the points off they should have gave him a warning your really stupid
Keoniquhikjhsojmni9n)ihkkjaHelpImDrunk
Whos here after ksi beat his ass
His career committed suicide in the forest
KSI avenged the Japanese man. His soul can rest in peace now.
@Im sorry sir its time for you to leave shut up satan
i hell doesnt exist
i stfu
In hell
Logang 4ever. Also for me he is winner, ksi was good but Logan won that fight.
0:33 did this girl really just day 15m followers on YouTube LOL in pretty sure it's subscribers. Weird flex but ok.
Now he lost against ksi lol
Paul is an asshole.
Take that L Logan
She said 15 million followers on YouTube xD
Of course Japan is the best at kamikaze
He just did a harakiri to his own career.
I hate Logan Paul, hes a spoiled little BITCH and he needs to grow up and get off YouTube. Hes fame that comes from little fan girls makes him have a chip on his shoulder
This is why i hate Logan paul
They funked over Lagan Paul because they have to many feelings fucking liberals suck. Just because it affected you someway because it was suicide doesnt mean he did anything wrong. Its not like he laughed because there was a dead body. He showed a video that he happen to get and wanted to raise awareness. I think hes a dick but not for that. Was just to many feelings involved by a bunch of clowns from liberal Hollywood.
SNEADLEVISION SLOTMAN except Logans fans are 8-10 years old and hes showing a dead body
You do realize most of his audience are kids? Some probably younger than 10.
im just here bc of nas daily
What a idiot
........
But nas posted there on YouTube
Did nas post on that area
Fuck U logan
Fuck your profile picture 
You fucking chap
Did anybody else see the video?? or just me
was the I get views appropriate ?
Yea to address the fact he wasnt trying to show a dead person for views or money
Ofc it was he has to flex how much views he gets lol
I think his channel needs to be demonetized for what he did That is very disrespectful towards to a deceased person and he should be charged with wait I don't know what criminal type of charges right now in Japan
He should have taken that stupid hat off.
There is no need to discuss about his reaction. One person committed suicide and we should focus on prevention. Depression is still taboo and not accepted in society. If you have any psychic problems, people want you to hide them. We have to learn to talk about it in society!
"followers in YouTube" really? I think it's "Subscribers" :) .
I don't see the problem .....if you hide death the entire time which the USA does and we are one of the only countries that does it.....it's a growing up experience and as a American you will only see it when you travel or war unless it's your family and the first time will destroy you especially when it's a loved one.
Wtf does it matter on the news its fucking YouTube and btw ik ABC news is only doing this for views
Here in 2019, after Ninja mentioned him in his say regarding "Content Creators".
Dont people ever think that it probably was a murder
Thats a great idea for a killer like if u kill someone jest put them in the suicide forest people with think They kill themselves
All of the comments on this video, are all *memes*  
What an asshole logan is
logan paul is a dumbass ive never liked him his personality is just douchey
I got to see the video
It's on archive.org
Beware cu'z he change just for like a week/ now his back on business/ dont get effected of this desease
Aaron Paul wanted everyone to make sure he is not affiliated with him 
Ksi saved his career
Why is everyone like mad at him he did not mean to say what he did
As everyone else has pointed out, he had plenty of time to review what he was saying and doing while he was filming, editing, and then uploading. In such an involved process, even if he wasn't completely in control of all his faculties whilst seeing a dead person, he should have known that the presentation was such that it should have been edited out and either discussed later or not brought up.
Yes, people come there in the forest and end there lives, they tie the string on the trees and they walk and stay there...they tie a string cause they might change their minds you can barely see light there i saw it from nas daily and nas friend went there and died, i know i am young but i know the right thing.
Ok but if YouTube deletes suicide could they delete porn?LITTLE KIDS WATCH IT TOO GET A BRAIN YOUTUBE!
ABC NEWS IS STUPID
Congratulations logan you are ruining youtube's reputation you fucking genius you are destroying the business that makes you get money because you are too fucking stupid to understand why what you are posting is wrong
You libtards do worse. Please dont be so hypocritical.
Holy hell this is Crazy
here this is for u logan  he doesn't care about what's happening (november 3 2019)
Lets be honest everyone makes jokes about this and dont fucking lie
The only idiot is the person who toke they own life in my opinion other people suffer from the stupid thing hes done by hanging himself
It happened. Get over it. Hate him for whatever reason. But the past is the past. and we can't change it.
Aight, let's forgive Hitler and Stalin, same goes for Mao, they killed like 6m+ but hey, that's years ago
He as over 15 million YouTube followers !!!!! 
Im so mad!
Agha Noor Vlogs no Im saying that I am so mad that the presenter of the news show talking about him said he has over 15 million YouTube followers cause there not called followers there called SUBSCRIBERS!
You are so jelous
You are messed up I hope you go through hell because of what you done here today and cannot be undone don't lie about it
15 million FOLLOWERS on youtube XD
ABC News you are shit
1:53 Awareness my big chubbe ass
15 million followers on YouTube 
Logan Paul: Ooo, dat a dead body?! 
Stupidity: It is time to ruin this boi's whole *career.*
LP is bothing but a piece of shit. Don't give him any attention.  
He should donate to #teamtrees
15 million followers on YouTube
Can someone share the real clip of the body
I really don't understand the backlash...
@Slap shot Studios1708 i believe they said the age range of his content was targeted to high schoolers to 21. So if he puts whats in it in the title, and he targeting this group but a kid sees it, I would say it's unfortunate. However this level of backlash is goofy imo.
DropSixteenTV Tv yes he does and if you see people who are fans of Logan theyre mostly children and theyll just click on the video because theyre big fans of him
@Slap shot Studios1708 but he put in the title there's a dead body from suicide and he doesn't make his content for kids. So no, I don't.
DropSixteenTV Tv most of Logans fans are kids and he goes into a forest known for suicides and films a dead body and you dont know why people are upset?
Bruh why do people even watch him
I still see no problem with that video and I never have. Theres a lot worse on YouTube.
Ben Richardson you have to be really stupid to not think thats its ok to film a dead body when most of youre fans are kids
Clearly you havent had to deal with suicide and dont even say that you have
It was extreme disrespect to that man and the firest itself. Read up on it it explicitly say dont film and dont take pictures logan slapped that whole country in the mouth and laughed
And thats the difference between a person who has empathy and one who doesnt. Never disrespect the dead especially knowing this one killed himself due to to toughlife situations.
Ben Richardson ??
He is such a douche bag.
Glad he won't be able to step a foot on Japan again. Haha 15 Million followers but no common sense.
I did it for awareness
*makes jokes about it*
Nobody:
LoGan PaUl: HEy I wAnT FucKinG ViEwS So LeT'S Go To A SuiCiDe ForEst anD FiLm SomEone ThAt tOok HiS LiFe
WHAT IS  WRONG  WITH  THIS  PERSON
Society today has become nothing but a bunch of fucking pussys who can't stand shit go back to your binkies until you grow the fuck up and can handle real life shit in society fuckwads
Makes you look like a coward too
Cussing every few words doesnt prove your point lol
Why are people in 2019 commenting on this video and hating on him 4 days ago lolol
Logan Paul: 15 mil subs
PewdiePie: 101 million
Me: YES
Well no shit its called suicide forest
I feel ashamed to have been a 12 year old when this happened.
Like nigga you go into suicide forest what you think you gonna find a pokemon
Everybody makes mistakes but I don't think you should blame the Maveric  Paul for something like this
PBN Trainers asosiation dude Logan had a lot of time to think about uploading the video that had a dead body in it when most of his fans are kids
Haters gonna hate
Followers on YouTube SUBSCRIBERS DUMBA**!!! SUBSCRIBERS!!!
This is how many people unsubscribed after the video
Logan Paul: *dances and films a dead man hanging from a tree* "lmaooooo im literally youtube history omg u guys its a dead dude lol"
Also Logan Paul: "I intended to raise awareness for suicide prevention."
Logan Paul: *waltzes into SUICIDE FOREST wearing a frickin TOY STORY ALIEN HAT, FILMS a dead person, taunts them, and titles video WE FOUND A DEAD BODY* lest we forget the thumbnail... 
Also Logan: nah nah Im not doing it for the views 
Rest In Peace to all those who have ended their life, if you are contemplating suicide, please get help, you are worth the world to someone although you may not know it 
Logan Paul: I'm sorry
The Guy who took his life: 
LolGetRektGaming more like _
I don't know how old this is but i never understood what happened lol
This still gives me chills I forgive him though
Omg stop commenting bad stuff about him!
Cuz I cant like all the comments 
#teamtrees 2019
"15000 FoLlOwErS on YouTube"
Vibe check
He's a April fool joke. I hope ksi demolishes him
Loser
Did he write that or did his intern write that 
There are 2 things I can't believe:
1- How idiot he is to think posting this was a good idea
2- How some people can still defend him
@Pancaqq no problem
Joo Leote yeah it was lol I just thought Id say that because people think he laughed disrespectfully! Sorry!
@Pancaqq Yeah, I laugh when nervous. But I didn't complained about he laughing, I complained about him showing a dead body in yt. Idk how much he censored, cuz I didn't watch the original video, but I heard it was little
Joo Leote there is a lot of evidence here that he may not be as crazy as you think. Have youve ever seen a dead body? Its scientifically proven that seeing somebody sad makes you sad. Also, in some people, feeling uncomfortable comes out with a laugh. Should he have posted it? No. There is no reason to not believe there was some human nature in there. Imagine how scary that wouldve been.
This big idiot Paul is still gaining subs coz JJ saves his carrer
6 reasons why Logan Paul is hated.
1. He is still healthy.
D 0 P E _ 2. Hes a dumbass
Me: thinking showing a dead cat to youtube is bad.
Logan: hold my juice box
Nobody:
Logan paul: wow! A dead body in the SUICIDE forest?!
This will be a great thing to post!??
Yeah Im here in 2019, and yeah Im still disgusted.
Vlad Constantinescu Youre going to hell and sucking Satans ass
is fucking fake
yeah me too cuz nobody understand that the dead body is a paid actor
Yep its actually fucking disgusting
*BOI*
Logan Paul cares about people lives? Ok, fine I guess I shall like him 1% more than than that 2%
fuck the ABC
Are you mad because they deservedly trashed your "God"?
Hey this was posted the same day as his apology video
This is funny to me. Because now if you act like Logan Paul you will be either chastised or non respected
know shit sherlock its called the suicide forest why would the be a body there logan?
0:34 "He has 15M *followers* on Youtube."
Most kids will be in disgust.
"I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention . . ." ?! Logan Paul is  disrespectful and a complete imbecile to lack any respect for the Dead. Also, on his video, he did not believe that the hang individual is a real corpse and he fooled around the hanged body. Over all, HE KNEW the nickname of the infamous Forest that its called "Suicide Forest" for a sole reason!!!! In other words, LOGAN PAUL is a DUMB FUCKED UP ASSHOLE who has no considerations about how precious life really is . . . . . . . .
"15 million followers on YouTube" 
Uh, they're called subscribers
The real question is that she said his channels followers
The real question is why do kids like you give a shit?
Que asco de canal el del tipo
The dumbing down of America is real
Dame the suicide forest made his career commit suicide via boxing  eh idk well see who wins lol
Even imjaystation visited suicide forest for the video
*"15 million FOLLOWERS on YOUTUBE"*
Internet: im gonna end this man career
Man I forgot about this lmao......but for real though Logan Paul shouldve realized that filming and laughing a dead body would kill his career :/
That dude is a fucking liar. what an Asshole
So what who cares people die everyday
A  yes but this guys fan base is mostly children and hes just posting a video showing a dead body
True, but it was still kinda messed up for filming it
Say that when someone you love dies.
Damn Paul u made a lot of haters xD
wait what is she said 15 million followers (she said followers ) is she gone mad due to the Logan Paul's video's
He is irrelevant
Logan Paul: says he was trying to raise awareness
Me:butcha didn't
But honesty suicide is not a joke and what he did was wrong
In my opinion he's a big idiot because he just ruined his career like majorly.
Hold up, how did he know that the guys hands were purple without his color glasses!?
I like how ABC news calls subscribers on YouTube followers
Dieser wichser!
Was hat er geraucht?
Logan paul is shit
What a liar
This guy was never sorry. What a charlatan.
Ikr what a tot, the scoundrel
Me: Sees body
Also me: I'mma report this..
So! Logan tell me why you didn't do this shit?
When they says followers instead of subscribers, like this is face book
So I see you have chosen death... Also
Nobody cares about this dood anymore
followers on youtube uh
At the time of this, I was a HUGE fan so as soon as I got that notification, I clicked straight away and I was one of the unlucky few. Some would call me  lucky  but its honestly a scaring image and I know how others who also saw this feel. The whole video was so wrong from the way he was going on about seeing dead bodies and he seemed excited to the fact that he showed the body to an audience made mostly of teenagers and young children but at least he blurred out the face of this poor person. More you tubers need to think twice or three times before posting something 
R.I.P.
But still, it was horrifying to see.
In my opinion, you were lucky to see that video. If it hadn't happened, you would never have seen Logan's true colors.
YouTube should of ban him for life
"top entertainers of the world* filming a dead body and uploading it is entertaining?
KSI will remove his last braincells after November 9th
But he didn't in his own hometown 
Why you think he will do beat him in usa
Is it kinda wrong that i wanna see the video...?
Mei kogg sdings. Bat hie is bikk
He also acting like a child
new lady: HE HAS 15 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE
YouTube: am I a joke to you.
I wish it wasnt deleted, I am trying to see a dead body, I go online and purposely search for this crap
Or just go outside and kill someone since theres something wrong with you
So go online and search for it...
I like how everyone is rooting for him with the KSI vs Logan Paul and they just totally forgot he laughed at a dead body last year 
"YUPPPPPPPPPP"
He laughed after finding the dead body how is that helping
y is he trying to box people he should just go back to videoing peoples dead bodies the pedo he's a fuking cunt and can go rag his mum the bitch
He has 15 million followers on YouTube
Wait you can get followers on YouTube?
@Vp Icy Ye, and I was just saying as well.
dsadsa sadsada lmao I was just saying
follower/subscriber. Same thing different name. Why do you kids even care :)
Hey guys can u follow me back plzz
Thahila Miller 
who's here in 2019 rewatching this because it makes them feel good ?
Me. I'm glad we got rid of Logan Paul...
Joe A.A  nope
Look at PewDiePie and hes pretty famous nextmeme
15 Million FOLLOWERS?! Seriously I thought they new what Subscribers were on YouTube because of the fact of them posting on it......
"He has 15 million *FOLLOWERS* on Youtube"
This guy is disgusting! He is not sorry and never will be because if he was he'd never had posted the video! And don't get me started on the "Oh, but he apologized and took down the video" sh** cause he only did it when he was loosing subscribers by the second! I'm not one to hate but if you still like this guy after this video and countless others like this then you are just as horrible as him.
Also, can you believe the nerve of this guy to say in one of his tweets "I didn't do it for views, *I have views*" as if he's telling you how popular he is even when he's supposed to be apologizing!? Honestly guys, I don't know how you kept calm and unbothered when you were saying all this. If I was there I would have probably told everyone to grab their pitch forks and torches cause we were going on a hunting spree.
Don't be like Logan paul or his idiot brother (who I'm sure is just as douchey as his bro, if not I'll be surprised) cause these people are hated by soooooo many people, including me. Be nice, respectful, kind and thank you for letting me rant. I really needed to. Bye
Everything about this literally screams he has no feelings
jake pal is an idiot a stupid ass hole
Thats Logan Paul are you sure you arent the idiot here lmao
I cant even find the damn Video ... has someone a link maybe??
It was deleted
Logan paul and jake paul are both shit
2027?
Guys let me explain a little drop of tea. Well if anyone sees a dead body in a freaking suicide forest they r prob gonna ditch the forest but lemme tell u my buddy Logan was all for the views he made sure that he had to record it. It only makes sense he is a clout chaser. No tea no shade but thats the truth.and ps rip the suicide victim they probably had a hard life sorry my dude. Rest In Peace at least now he is in a coffin probably and not in Logan Pauls youtube videos.
Yes I liked my own comment 
2019 anyone?!
Aaliyah hola
Seems like people are making a huge deal about this because of who he is not what he did. There are countless similar videos all over the internet. So freakin what.
Paul Hutchinson most of Logans fans are little kids and the other channels who show dead bodies are mostly aimed at adults
I dont understand why people get so mad about showing a dead body shit if you find my body somewhere video away  give me the opportunity to photo bomb you as a ghost :P
Chance friend because most of Logans are children ages 8-10 and here he is posting a video with a dead body
Oh hell no you have 6.66 million subs
I'mma head out
2020?? Anyone?
Mate tell him KSI is better
2018: F*,#$! YOU IOGAN!!
2019: GOOD LOGAN...
Logan paul: NANI!?
Lets take a moment to acknowledge how she said "He has 15 million *followers* on youtube"
Okay....Nope still don't give a shit.
I wish this never happened to him you know how much better his life would be
Jerr S you right
LightningWolf TV oh please. Cry me a dang river, dont make him out like hes the victim in all this. Hes not.
I do believe in the old saying, 'What does not kill you makes you stronger.' Our experiences, good and bad, make us who we are. By overcoming difficulties, we gain strength and maturity.Learning lessons is a little like reaching maturity. You're not suddenly more happy, wealthy, or powerful, but you understand the world around you better, and you're at peace with yourself. Learning life's lessons is not about making your life perfect, but about seeing life as it was meant to be.
You know you fucked up when even Sansa Stark is pissed at you
Definitely
*battotai intensifies*
Why are people mad? It's nothing more than a dead person. Sure, it was someone's family but in the end all we are is dust. This is not an offensive video , people need to grow up
You're saying people should come to grips with the fact that this life, everything we have experienced and ever will is gonna eventually end, and that we should make fun of people for which this enternal doom has already happened, disrespecting their family who has not yet come to terms with the fact that they have to live the rest of their lives with this one person?
james Clark well dude Logans fans are mostly little kids and Logan posted a video with a dead body in it and youre ok with it?
You are 12.
james Clark oh you poor sad idiot
James Clark, it is considered disrespectful to film a dead body. Human 101...
And I have to share my birthday with this guy
Did Logan take down the vid?
Yeah he took it down immediately because he didnt get the reaction he wanted
"Followers" on YouTube are subscribers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w If you're so uptight about someone clear doesn't use YouTube using the word follower instead of subscribers. You might want to get off of here for a little while.
1 year later:
I FOUND A DEAD BODY AT *AREA 51*
Jesus Christ XD
If the press conference brought you from the kong video to here then welcome
Is that jake paul?
Logan
Did no one save this shit wtf??? I wanna watch it it got taken down before I could watch it when it first came out

Logan is a nice good looking person and that's why chloe bennet loves him so much.

Followers on youtube
Come on..give guy a break. He didn't record person committing suicide, he just uploaded a video of a dead body he found, he wasn't  thinking at moment about it being insensitive. Hell if i stubbled on a dead body some where i might bust out my phone to record or snap pics without thinking cuz its not something i have seen before and I'd be in shock.
You are a horrible person.
22 is old enough to know when something is insensitive or not.
Yikes. His ego is in turmoil. Clearly a lost soul.
why do they keep calling subs on yt followers
The real question is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w If you're so uptight about someone clear doesn't use YouTube using the word follower instead of subscribers. You might want to get off of here for a little while.
No room for the weak in this world. Hey! Aaron the one who should be rotting in hell is the one who committed suicide. Plain and simple if you weak than please take the easy way out. 
0:35 followers on youtube XD its called subscribers miss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w If you're so uptight about someone who clearly doesn't use YouTube using the word follower instead of subscribers. You might want to get off of here for a little while.
Me to
Omfg. Shut the fuck up.
He posted a clip of an adult that made a conscious decision to take their own life (Aka: a loser, or someone who is mentally ill)....
He didn't KILL anyone.
I'm fuckin sick of people shitting on others for what they post...
THAT'S WHAT THE INTERNET IS, ACCESS TO INFORMATION. The more that gets posted the BETTER. I WANT diversity and both Light and DARK on the internet. Not just sunshine.
Post EVERYTHING.
Fucking sjw crybabies
@Slap shot Studios1708 I know a few people who decided to take their lives. I was the first to call them losers.
Life is fucking tough for everyone. Suicide is an easy way out.
And it's not what you take it's what you leave behind. People who commit suicide that have families are dicks.
It's a selfish act.
And you're never gonna convince me that someone who takes their own life should be labeled a "winner". 
Sorry pal, that's an uphill battle you are simply NOT going to win.
Good luck with your idiotic views
Mathieu Lafreniere dude Logans fans are mostly kids so people are gonna get upset if he posts a video with a dead body and I cant wait for someone you know to commit suicide and for someone to call them a loser
I'm sure the mans family and friends wanted him to be known as the suicide victim in a Logan Paul vlog.
He didnt care he only cared when he got caught smh hes trash
What a sociopath!  No true remorse at all!
Little over dramatic dont you think?
Fuck off it was awile ago dumbass
Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.
I get that he was a piece of shit,but i don't get why everyone is so sad about that person who comitted suicide..Like WHO CARES?!The idiots who comit suicide don't worth attention,they are just narcisistic and egotistical and they care just about themselves and don't give a shit about the families and friends they left behind!
Fair point actually
lets go ksi
I remember when I saw the video with my cousin Cece and we..... we where scarred for life
19 million followers. Yep, the west is fucked period. China will be nr 1 and that's a fact 
He reminds me jimmy Saville he looks fucking creepy.
HE HAS 15 MILLION FOLLOWERS 
Seriously followers? Smh
It's literally the same thing
15 *followers* on Youtube 
I mean accidentally show a suicide corpse on cam is one thing, to mock the corpse is fucked up
Eu posso matar ele?!
Who else is after seeing akiderest's video
Logan Paul: imma go visit the suicide forest
Suicide forest: ima bout to end this mans whole career
Im not watching him I watch tanner bruangardt
Logan or Logan?
Youtube: Lets wreck the sml one. Puppet abuse is worse than showing a dead body.
Pewdipie has fuck more subscribers than him and he didnt do anything.
Every popular you tuber deals with a controversy one in a while, CAN WE COPYSTRIKE PEWDIEPIE?!
He is always been an idiot! But most people anywhere are stupid! If you are intelligent, you know you are a minority!
Do these people even watch youtube
How is showing a DEAD BODY on camera and posting it to a public website for millions of people to see... Spreading awareness to suicide? Seriously.
0:33 its subscribers idiot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w If you're so uptight about someone who clearly doesn't use YouTube using the word follower instead of subscribers. You might want to get off of here for a little while.
who cares followers subs who cares
why does he still have millions of subs
The same reason people are supposedly going to storm today Area 51. Their zombie idiots who can't think for themselves and, they just do what someone on the internet tells them to do.
Let me guess...
Your on YouTube 
Watching Throw back vids 
And this situation pops into ur mind 
And here we are
10/10
Anyone search up pranks gone wrong and saw this?
I know I'm late but this video made me yell dang like omg
Logan: founds a dead body
*Come on get the camera*
Erghh people need to lighten the fuck up and stfu complaining
I would off been soo happy if that fucking sick cunt got arrested they should tbh
Don't worry he filmed a dead body,ksi will return the favor
Thats such bullshit. He did it for views.
Tfw still not banned
i never liked logan paul and always knew he was stupid just by looking at him
Legend says that no one will see this comment :)
Damn am I the chosen one?!?!
Wrong.
it was wrong
Nobody  Cares  What  Year  You  Watched  This  In  :) 
The moral is: Logan is and will always be a moron
A baby's mind in an adult's body. Definition of idiotic.
Reporter:he has 15 million followers on youtube 
Me:well God damn I though it was subscribers
He ducks m
I am not standing up for Logan but they blew this a little bit out of proportion i think we can agree on that
Not really this was messed up!
Snard Alexander im not saying it wasnt terrible what he did im just saying it went on for way too long and nobody unless you yourself kills somebody deserves to have that much hate and negativity towards them for a whole year and a half. (again im not saying what he did is not terrible and im not saying that most of the hate he got for it was wrong.)
Really? Please tell me how showing 6 - 15 year old kid(his audience) a hanging body and laughing about it live is being blown out of proportion. The videos dont upload themselves. He had time to think before uploading. He played it off like an adventure and openly showed the body.  Suicide aside , are you fine with someone making money joking over your family member's corpse.
So they let people go into a forest to kill them selves but lose it cuz a guy filmed it. Idiots if u dont want people filming dead bodies then dont let people hang them selves in a public forest.
Btw I hate the guy I just think this particular situation is retarded
Japans suicide forest is a popular destination and for anyone who wants to find dead body and film it for YouTube videos and shows so look it up on YouTube they have thousands of videos on it  Japan doesnt care they make money from tourists.
You're delusional
It's forbidden to go in there but ok
I know were i'm going tonight.!!!!!!!
I want to find this video just so I can dislike it
Bro wtf its called a suicide forrest i fucking hate these soft ass bitches
Where I can find the original video?
I saw this video
Why not watch it on 2019 bro
0:34 it's called subscribers lady ok get it right jk
He is a mistake
Fake news. Your a faker
col wdym Logan did post the video
0:40 targeting an audience made of teenagers and children
Nah just children
Personally i think you are both children for arguing about such a small thing as age identity. Lol. Who cares. The real facts are (Logan Paul) is a piece of shit...
@cowdeemo Lol but their not in a different category their in the same which is a fact not a opinion. A opinion on age is basically kinda like "Oh 12 year olds aren't kids their preteens" that's a opinion but saying teenagers aren't children isn't a opinion. Even people think 11 year olds are preteens but at the end of the day we are all children until 18. Don't know why you people don't get it.
@Ilpveanime Iloveanjme Okay, but in this instance, we are referring to children and teens as a different category, according to the main comment.
@cowdeemo That is when you talk about children and teens. Everybody have a opinion on who is a child and who is not. How about 11 and 12 are they not children. Also 18 and 19 are adult teens but I'm still going to put them in the adult category.
@Ilpveanime Iloveanjme When we talk about Teenagers and Children, we are obviously talking about young kids (typically around 10) and teens who are around age 16. Also, teenage years go up to the age of 19.
I dont see why people trippin he didnt kill him he jus got a dead body on video from what I see he realized he made a mistake and apologized and took the video down if it were for views hed really keep the video up there worse shit happening and ppl trippin over a dead body the body doesnt matter when its dead the soul is out and gone wherever he went I like Logan no matter what no ones says Im tired of this shit 
Slap shot Studios1708 yea but I dont hold people accountable for what they did in the past unless its a murderer but even then when that person realizes their mistake is really important and these kids are gonna see stuff regardless this world is pretty ugly hec even Disney has dead bodies in some kid cartoons so we really need to learn to move on but theres a lot of soft hearted people so that pretty difficult rn i understand its morbid and not family friendly at all but at the end of the day no one is perfect everyone makes mistake now hes growing and stuff so yeah
Trey Burwell you have to understand that most of Logans fans are little kids and people are gonna get upset when he posts a video with a dead body to little kids
I probably would of shown the dead body too, we see worse on the internet!! 
thegoldmicrophone if most of youre audience was kids would you post a dead body?
I didnt do it for views.. 
*so youre going to exploit a suicide victim to raise awareness?*
@Thanos on drugs you can tell who is serious and who is not, Logan always acts like he is a nice guy while ksi admits he's a cunt when they are asked about their wrong doings
@Thanos on drugs i was being sarcastic, ksi is almost as bad as logan
"Allegedly"
 What are you smoking?
Jesus i wish youtube would just throw jake paul's youtube channel away
I am Japanese myself but I honestly don't give a shit or two fucks that Logan Paul did this. I still watch his channel
@Paper I dont know i just encountered him
What a conversation lmao
@Sir Alfred Fuck YOU
Kazuma Bunch just tell me you little shit
@Sir Alfred why do you care
15 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE do you mean subs
Lavander town music fits suicide forest perfectly.
Definitely a desperate attempt for attention/ a sub spike
Logan *PAUL* VS Aaron *PAUL* 
hmmmmmm.....
WHYY AA MMMIII  WARTTCHHHINGG THHISS
thisguysucksandismean
Again why is he so stupid to put that on the internet
I can't find the video..can anyone told me is there a video of paul. i can't see it in his channel
Deleted for obvious reasons
Im in 2019 whyyyyyyy
*Why a lot of people dislikes him.*
Gacha Builder James because he posted a dead body on his YouTube channel when most of his fans are kids
Dang you got Aaron Paul hating on u...
"He posted a video targeting *_teenagers_* and children"
Bruh what teen watches this shit
The fact that he's popular at all on YouTube or anywhere else just shows the depraved state of America.
Lmfao sad thing is... the famous people that lashed out against him. Only did it for attention as well. So in hindsight they are just huge worthless cunts that deserve as much hate as him. I hope they all die soon.
He said sorry  its a ded meme now  >_<
that doesn't mean anything
You think this is bad filthy frank has cooked a bunch of dead rats even baby ones
This guy is a walking tumor.
This is why jake pual is better
Chris Gamch sesone episodes both Logan and jake are shitty people
KOGAN PAUL IS AN ABSOLUTE IDIOT!! 
I ment Logan :P
I already saw this year ago on the news
Filming the dead body was a good thing so people will know what happend to him
Bubbadeaux people were gonna find out anyways
No he didnt he knew what he was doing
Its crazy to think im watching this in august 2019 and i remember watching that video and being traumatized. I was 11 at the time and i thought suicide was fine bc of this video. I remember showing my sibling this video, the part with the body. i was a huge logan fan and that changed everything
I thought his career was over and felt so happy 
@T. K 14 Exactly bro, thats it 
@Thanos on drugs nah, I'm cool in middle class, better than being a rich moron, also, he isn't successful, being successful means doing something you love, the dude probably has to act like a moron for his fanboys who think he's cool, but the truth is all of you are just money bags to him
My kids saw the video and I was absolutely livid. Especially as I lost my brother through suicide. Suicide is not something to be shown like this talk to the survivors of suicide and see what's left behind not doing what he did
Why are people upset about this there are suicide videos all over YouTube, yeah their old but they still show
Damarcus Hode because those videos were aimed mostly at adults while most of Logans fans were little kids
I will disown my kids if they watch this
Joe Feigenbutz no any Jake Paul videos
The news?
who actually wants to see the vid to know what happened?
Her:HE HAS 15 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE
me:you follow people on youtube ?
Hey Logan toy story 4 is out
Guy has two first names
I dont think Logan did it on purpose. Calm down
Kourt Nee ah yes because he went into a forest know for suicide, filmed a dead body, edited the video, and uploaded the video on accident
@Angela Song why are people defending him he literally showed a dead body
Kourt Nee ?????? So what youre saying is he didnt mean to upload the video on purpose or he didnt mean to be disrespectful to the deceased on purpose????? Clearly, he was the one who decided to go to the forest, film the dead body and post it on youtube. Which part of this was not done on purpose? Please help me understand cuz I really dont.
Logan is such a dumb ass he disrespected the japan culture
***FOLLOWERSSSSSSS***
Ive NEVER liked Logan and now I hate him
15 million *        *
*STONKS*
Oh wow,YouTube are such wimps
Whos here after rice gums new vid
Logan: I Did it because i thought i could make an Positive influence and raise the awareness for Suicide
Me: *SMELLS LIKE BULLSHIT!*
LOL I TYPED UP Beta squad AND IT SAID THIS WAS RELATED! WAAAT!!?? 
Honestly this got way too much attention. People are too protective in America. If you lived in syria, kids are fighting in wars, dead bodies littering the street.
Logan is a narcissistic sociopath with zero conscience or real empathy . What a friggen loser !
I can bet you, I can BET you, that if he didn't get all this backlash and hate, that he would've never apologized for that video, that he would have no respect for that person at all. I BET you that. He is a heartless asshole and that is where I fully lost all respect for him. Absolutely Disgusting.
Tbh I always hated him but I saw the video posted and watched it and saw the og video
If this video was age restricted, this would get no dislikes
This is disrespectful he actually disrespected the Japanese culture to like dude that's just wrong u crossed the line
To be fair the dude shouldnt have killed himself in the first place, tho I dont agree with Logans actions
@Wilisey p do you not realize that well he's disrespecting a dead man n the took he's life and Jake Paul or Logan Paul whoever this is they both disrespected a culture
rd  bruh why r u so pissed off??
Honestly, he was very disrespectful to the people in Japan.
He threw pokeballs at people in japan
DARK SHADOW heck yeah
Luna Animates youre still commenting on this when its old af
liss I know :p
Ya think?
That dead body is logan watch the film and you'll see! Its the same woods!
Y'all worried about her saying followers but not the actual problem
He shall be haunted by the person I am no sad that the person did delete ;-;
Im ugly and sick
I want to die here in suicide Forest
You alive still
Well this screwed poor Logan hard, and its almost gonna be 2 years since this happened.
Iamin2019
Its called subscribers
Trying to be cool you look like a fool. Wish you can commit suicide
I don't like Logan Paul, but he has got more clout then u
I bet, #KevinHines is
Very disappointed in
Logan Paul
I question people who subscribe to Logan Paul.
He wrote the apologies on notes-
Never would watch a prick like him
" Wow he's so famous "
*PewDiePie wants to know your location*
They make face news everyday, not this one however
"Allegedly" They have video of it and time to "grow up" No time to suffer the consequences of your actions.
First:Logan Paul
Second:James Charles
Whos next
He has 15 million followers on YouTube... *Hmmm*
Best day of my life
Start Of 2018
Now to 2019
Sooner will be 2020
*HERE'S A PERFECT SONG FOR THIS VIDEO!* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYrOj1grqqY
He's not a star
*He's a messed up guy*
Why is there a forest with people who soes
Why did he suicide?
I dont freaking know hes probably depressed or something
11 mil vieuws oof hahahah
Fucking moron. Hes not sorry. Just sorry internet turned on him...
Filming a guy and joking about a dead guy..
Dude is a straight disgusting wierdo fuck, I have seen a dead body and it's no joke I couldn't look at it for more than 2 seconds before I ran like a girl with chills that wouldn't go away
This makes me want to commit tree rope
The people hating on Logan Paul for finding  a dead body are really disgusting me for their hate. We really don't care what you say and nobody ever came out and asked for your opinion.
 Irish Potato   Irish Potato  Im irish and Im ashamed that you have Irish in your name and youre hating on people for criticizing Logan Paul FOR TRYING TO GET VIEWS OF SHOWING A DEAD BODY !!!!
 Irish Potato  Im irish and Im ashamed that you have Irish in your name and youre hating on people for criticizing Logan Paul FOR TRYING TO GET VIEWS OF SHOWING A DEAD BODY !!!!
Who asked for your opinion?
Does someone has the full video ???
Logan can still go die
This lady is Jealous I can feel it
Jeiry Pena LOGAN PAUL is weird and messed up
Logan did bot right that he is yo dumb
Guys momo is making kids commit suicide put momo in the forest and shell kill herself
Even Pewdiepie doesn't like him.
This is why i hate Logan Paul?
There should be an annual reminder of how stupid Logan Paul is on the date that he posted the video.
After watching this I'm ashame to face the people of Japan which I always admire them for their hospitality and the beautiful cherry tree which I always wanted to see...... right now I feel empty to go after what Logan Paul did
*"did we find a dead body in the "suicide" forest?"....* -Logan Paul
What a fucken idiot
You were my faborite
Why logan
Algum Brasileiro aqui ?
Its not a dead body its just a munchkin on the rope swinging
disrespectful and not even funny.
I love how jake and Logan have millions of subscribers for doing dumb things and here I am at 40 subscribers.
Suicide ist terrible
*me going down the comments and finding Logan Paul fanboys*
Me seeing a Logan Paul Fanboy
*me going down the comments and finding logan fanboys,ready to roast them with logic* 
Damm, and ppl are still subscribing to this guys, smh. His subscribers are also like him or worse.
Oh wait yes morning and scribers than you
He gets more money to know if you right now
So what he saw a dead body how does that make Logan a bad guy. We should start persecuting everyone who finds a dead body
It doesnt give him the right to act all excited and record the body up close
Imagine killing yourself to end your shitty life just to be found by logan paul.. This would give me a good enough reason to live.
In general i just dont like the image of a dead person unless its fake like in the movies etc but real one?? Who had real life HELL NAHH
It's been almost two years....OMG
That's why kids are screwed up all the trash they see on YouTube TV and video games this guy's garbage could have did something better sorry don't cut it sorry bastard
He may be lying
**laughs in depression**
Anybody got the original vid send link if so
me:*reads title*
Also me:*sees Logan Paul *
Yes, still me: HOLY SH- LOGAN PAUL DIED!
We'll get him next time
He has 15 million followers on YouTube
The real question. Who else in the WhiteMilitia wants ALL these clowns extinct
*NOW ABC I HOPE YOUR NOT ACTING ALL SELF-RIGHTEOUS HERE~ BACK IN 1974 YOU HAVE FILMED A SUICIDE YOURSELF: NOW I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T EXPECT A SUICIDE ON YOUR WXLT-TV STATION, BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN. AND FOR THE RECORD, THAT SUICIDE WAS FILMED UNLIKE LOGAN PAUL'S VIDEO THAT SHOWS THE DEAD NIP! DOES ''CHRISTINE CHUBBUCK'' RING A BELL TO YOU ABC?*
NECHO II *YOUR A FUCKING IMBOSILE, LOGAN PAUL POSTED THE VIDEO BECAUSE HE WANTED VIEWS AND HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS SUICIDE IN HIS VIDEO WHILE THIS NEWS ORGANIZATION WAS LIVE STREAMING NEWS AND KILLED HERSELF UNEXPECTEDLY, THE NEWS ORGANIZATION DIDNT KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT LOGAN WAS FULLY AWARE AND HE EVEN POSTED IT AS THE TUMBNAIL*
*WELL MAYBE NEXT TIME HE WILL FILM HIMSELF TAKING A PISS ON THE DEAD VICTIM, THAT'S HOW WE WILL KNOW THAT HIS APOLOGY WAS PHONY!*
There's a problem a news organization filming a story for the news. and a vlogger filming something for humor and entertainment.
What a fuckin dweeb
You fucked up Etika. Fuck you Logan you human garbage.
Youre saying Logan Pauls the reason why etikas gone?
Nobody:

Terminal illness or end-stage disease is an incurable disease that cannot be adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in the death of the patient. Terminal patients have options for disease management after diagnosis. Examples include caregiving, continued treatment, hospice care, and  PHYSICIAN -ASSISTED SUICIDE.
I didnt do it for the views.
Me: *OH SHUT THE FUCK UP.*
Yeah that was a lie
So.. i search "why everyone hates logan paul" *bcoz i really don't know why people hates him so much* and this video appeared 
*now i know why*
I would like to see Someone laugh at his dead body.
It would be ironic as hell.
*NOW I'M NO FAN OF THE PAUL'S HERE BUT LET'S NOT MAKE AN ADOLF HITLER OUT OF LOGAN PAUL~ THERE ARE FAR FAR WORSE THINGS IN THE WORLD TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THEN SOME YAHOO LAUGHING UNCOMFORTABLY AT A DEAD BODY: I HAVE SEEN SUICIDE VIDEOS (which include one that was caught on video by ABC themselves.) I KNOW THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE BOO-HOO GENERATION WHERE EVERYONE IS OVERSENSITIVE AND SHIT BUT STILL, I THINK IT'S LONG ABOUT TIME THAT WE AS A GENERATION NEED TO GROW THICKER SKIN AND A STRONGER BACK BONE INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE WIMPS AND CRYBABIES! WHAT THE FUCK WOULD HAPPEN IF LOGAN PAUL WAS A GRAVE ROBBER? THE WORLD WOULD SHATTER!!*
NECHO II who do you think I'm referring to?
Wow 2018 was a bad bad year for Logan Paul
..... This is messed up...
Yooooo Aaron Paul your my guy
Ok he laughed because he had a concoction in 7 ty which made him unable to feel empathy thats why he cried because he cant handle empathy or stay in relationships
He laughed at a dead body,and filmed it.
Hes an idiot.
For all i know if he ever finds my dead body that fucker is gonna kill himself before my sprit gets to
Is it clickbait?
"He has 15 million followers on YouTube"
wow somebody needs to get their terms right
@Arolema Prarath Yup
Same shit kiddo
They just gave him free clout
I know it's in the past but he is banned from Japan but if he comes back to Japan he will be arrested with multiple charges and I still will never forgive him for what he did
killingmaiself uallshouldbehappy Sorry for being a douchebag. If I offended you.
@Teddy James I. Only used it once lmao you don't know me irl
Stop using Y'all. Only cucks use that term.
@Teddy James may I ask how? I'm just letting y'all know..
Teddy James Care to explain why?
Hurry up don't leave me hanging
I find him very disrespectful. It is not to late to change Logan. Do what is right. You should be a good example please take the responsibility as an influencer. Humans don't say respect, it is done, my bro.
During the trip in Japan he had been being so rude and even never respected other culture and his arrogant never ends to boot.
He is an idiot he talks rubbish I am Logan Paul bla bla bla
His apology dose not mater
Screw him that is not funny
hes a retard from Ohio
Eh, it didn't seem all that bad to me.
HE AIN'T DAT HUGE OF A FAME
Excuse me but are all American are such idiot, may I ask..
Nope, Just some of the ones we make famous.
The fucking guy is indeed fucking psychopath
I remember watching this when it came out bc it was in my recommended
wherer im can find vidio?
@Starberrymalk im found vidio in dark web because to much drugs ad
emilisgamerlt ;0 If you look it up on google, some sites have it. None of the sites will be YouTube, however. Most likely DailyMotion or something.
1:06 bottom left under the pic of Logan Paul 
YouTube Shame on you for this garbage Same with you jake you hypocritical witches
Jenna marbles APOLOGY FOR GETTING THE WRONG FISH TANK was more sincere than Logans apology for filming a goddamn dead body
Edit: it auto corrected to filling srry
0:22 top entertainment influencers in the world try watching one of his videos. 90% of his videos are shit,9% of his videos are even shittier and 100000% his dad kissing more little girls
TODAY, IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!!!!!!!!!!!
15m followers on youtube
Dont let these people near youtube ever again
"HE SUCKS HORSE SHIT ENDORSE THAT "
I don't get it why did he do it
Bunch of fucking cry babies
Can you really blame them tho
How stupid can you be. Logan Paul you are the reason some youtubers suck. Logan you deserve all the hate. Why the fuck would you show a dead body on YouTube. Stupid ass nigga. I wish i could just slap the shit out of you. You are the reason dashie aint funny, bhd aint funny you son of a bitch. Then you have the nerve to say this was to teach kids not to do suicide. BITCH, you the reason Etika killed himself. YOU MADE YOUTUBE THIS WAY. Stupid ass nigga. You tried to entertain people by showing dead fucking body, and expected nothing to happen. Stupid ass, piece of shit ass, making excuses ass , bottom of my shoe faced ass. FUCK YOUR APOLOGY, FUCK YOUR CHANNEL, AND FUCK YOU.
He needs to be behide bars TONIGHT!!
followers on youtube
we forgive you
You spelled I wrong.
There is no bad publicity
And there's actually a forest called suicide forest? If it wasn't for this Logan guy, I would've never known about such place. Suicide is an epidemic in this modern era. He actually did a great job relating the place.
I always knew he'd screw up one day, i just didn't know how bad...
U suck for news
He dies almost everyday chill
Im disappointed. Suicide / Depression is NOT a joke. He should regret that ALOT.
The only regret he has is about how it might negatively affect his YouTube subscriber count.
Hes not sorry. He really isnt. He just doesnt want his career to end. Which is why I am questioning why he even still has subs. Why do ppl still like him after all the crap he has done. He doesnt deserve his subs. He doesnt even appreciate them. And if he intended to raise awareness then why the hell was he making jokes of the man. It absolutely disgusts me. It really does.
15 million followers
YouTube: *am i a joke to you?*
I wonder how many subscribers he has now after that incident
I wouldnt even accept his apologize
He has 15 million *followers* on YouTube
its about time we start a crusade
YOU CRIED LIKE a FUCKING BITCH...asking i am SORRY...A GROWN AS MAN AND DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE...fuckin PATHETIC..you DON'T have the FUCKING BALLS TO ADMIT the TRUTH...YOU did it FOR "VIEWs"....SERIOUSLY ARE YOU THAT FUKIN STUPID
Logan Paul...YOU are so full of SHIT...an influence...SERIOUSLY HOW the FUCK...YOU DID IT FOR FUCKIN VIEWS...FUCKIN admit it...Why why the FUCK would I be i have TO be pretty FUCKIN PATHETIC to be influenced by you
YouTube has subscribers
Hate watch is that a real thing ?
Daz Black sums this up incredibly but strong language but its worth it
Oh. I went in the woods and what was that smell and saw  is it a dead body no it Logan Paul carrer
He made a big mistake to gain views. His fault.
15 million followers
FOLLOWERS?!?! its called subscribers, mate
He fin sucks
1:54 if I remember correctly...in the video he _pointed and laughed_ at the dead man. I might not be correct. I didn't watch the video, but he was smiling WAY too much to be trying to cause a "positive ripple" and raise awareness about suicide. He and his awful brother disgust me. They need to stop getting attention. Everything they do is selfish and fake and they need to not have YouTube channels. Or any kind of social media. If I could, I would dump them on a remote island, with no cameras, no supplies nothing. And let them not be part of civilizations problems.
Screw Logan Paul hes an  idiot screw his apology its not ok he needs to go back to that place and find those dead bodies and apologize!!
dont watch this. If you havent got tallent you could apply for job though.
WHAT TYE F IS LOGAN THINKING BEFORE GOING TO SUCIDE FOREST look now what happend
they talked about him like he was the poster boy for youtube
15 million followers what the fuck
Tbh I dont give af :/
hE hAs FiFtTeEn MiLlIoN FOLLOWERS oN YOUTUBE
Idk y they trippin they used 2 hang our ppl all the time.... AND LAUGH ABOUT IT. Hypocritical ass bs
Oh and I'm sorry Logan I was just sooo mad sorry I'm a shame I'm nothing but junk
Oh god sakes what the heck Logan what's wrong with you and sorry lord I pray for you forgiveness pls
He claims it was suicide awareness 
The only awareness hes spreading is if someone finds your corpse, they might just film it and put it online
Humanity Killed The Cat 
I will just haunt him forever
People will always still film a dead person and put it online just for clout. When XXXTENTACION got shot, someone filmed his corpse and it went all over social media, nobody tried tracking that guy down because he didnt have fame and wasnt as successful as Logan.
Humanity Killed The Cat I would after what he fucking did
Jake: Im a bigger douchebag than my brother.!
Logan: hold my beer little bro.
Followers on YouTube ( facepalm )
The world hates him. Wed wish you'd do something and stop the ridiculousness.
Who member of this
He not the most the entertaining person to me...SAD
In my opinion at least dont get mad but, I believe that if it was any other youtuber not as popular as or is Logan Paul, they wouldnt have received as much backlash. I say this because a lot of people dislike logan Paul. And further more onto the celebrities and you tubers, suicide is a very serious topic and should not be joked with, however most of the other people that called out Logan were probably just doing for attention. But like I said it is a serious topic so most people who called Logan out were just pissed off with him. I am not trying to defend Logan. What he did was wrong.

I ain't mad or offended at this video at all and I dont see why people are what I see is that if he didnt find that body it would still be there not put at rest and yeah he was rude with his reaction but why people offended at him posting a video of a dead body people are saying kids are watching but let's all be honest kids are not innocent these days anymore they already seen stuff and its different seeing it on video than in real life I'm not taking up for him at all because I'm not a fan I dont watch him nor do i judge him but really what's wrong with everyone getting offended when they should be happy thay the family thats been waiting to get their child back or a love one that's been waiting has got a body to put at rest not to leave that body in the woods would be very disrespectful I think people should go find them bodies in that woods and put then at rest just saying everyone has already been exposed to the world so what's the problem with a dead body I mean I understand why he should have covered it cause it's really disgusting but why get so offended by it I would like to hear others side of the story
Seriously he gets views so he didn't do it for views
Ppl need to seriously get a life ok I do not pitty cowards who take there life ok my birth father did that and never knew him but I will say this he did not go in thinking it was going to be that way ok he did nothing wrong in his video ok he didnt do shit its not his fault someone did that to them self he was showing the real ness of that forest ppl go there in real life all around the world to really kill them selves there is a movie made on Netflix of this forest so for all ppl sooo concerned go rage on ppl who allow these ppl to go there to do that shit they know why there walking into that forest ok so for ppl to get made at Logan Paul ur fucking idiots ok ur made at wat he showed the idiot who willing walked in the woods to hang him self like the coward he was or u made that the ppl running the park allowed the guy to walk in woods to hang him self instead of calling cops and getting this guy help come on ppl get off ur asses do something with ur life get off YouTube and stop blaming ppl for actions they didnt even do he showed the facts and truth of a place in this world that allows ppl to just kill them selves in ppl are fucking retarded
No one gave you permission to make this news
A "popular" YouTuber did the moment he posted a disrespectful video on youtube.
Why am I here in 2019??
The worst part is kids are defending this man here in the comments section i mean like lol wut.
THEN WHY DID HE DANCE WITH IT AND LAUGH HES AN IDIOT
LOGAN PAUL IS SUCH AN IDIOT I USED TO WATCH HIM BUT NOW I HATE HIM
Bull fucking shit that he didnt do it for views
*goes in suicide forest and doesn't expect to find a dead body* Logan Paul logic
15. Million followers really?
humans are pathetic creatures after all
Hes the definition of dogshit
I hope the Japanese government bans Logan Paul from entering Japan ever again! #knowyourlimitsson
The Japanese government already did that.
this is good content
How? How was this a mistake? You film the video, you edit the video, you upload the video and not once do you think "How does this make me look as an inspiration, as a person, and as a YouTuber?" 
You have little kids watching your channel, I'm talking 12, 10 and maybe even younger who look up to you for inspiration. And what do you do? You film a dead guy and even worse, you joke about it. They don't know any better than to do this. They don't know right from wrong. They see you do it and think "that's okay, that'll get me views" when they have phones and can hide away from their parents and watch this stuff. They don't have their parents there watching their every search and every video they watch so their parents aren't there to tell them "this is wrong. This is VERY wrong, do not joke about this". 
Suicide and depression is NOT something to joke about. I've been through depression myself. I've had friends go through it. I've seen what it does to people, and I can tell you there's nothing funny about it. And for you to find humor in it makes me question whether or not you are actually a human being.
Oh my god
Take a big FUCK to logan paul
Can we set a law to ban him from Asia? We don't need anymore Donald Ducks here
Logan Paul is a horrible person, and not soothed as any form of role model.
DUDE I CONT STOOP ITS SAYORI
Paano pa pala yung kay Keith Talens ?
i intended to raise awairness about sueisude, by making fun of a dead body.
Next video: throwing shoes on traffic lights
U people are stupid.( not l9gan paul) u people watch countless stupid videos.excuse him for not realizing that his audience of morons( even myself)would take offence of a dead body when they dont take offense to racism' stupidity, and other quistionable jokes, videos,and such.this world is done and has been.we all need to wrap it up....
Did she say youtube F O L L O W E R S
His face looks like the mugshot of Jeffrey Dahmer.

Me and my sister were laughing so hard and teased him and posted this to all our friends when we saw this on YouTube while getting cereal XD
Logan is a human I hate to have to hate him but this sivkens me
This is normal I didn't see anything no one died Logan didn't do nuttin.......
Right?
I honestly believe that Logan took the video down due to the dislike to like ratio
Omg everyone is it like he told him to do it ............no sis so..........shut up about it stilll in 2019 i still get reminded just leave logan alone I dont know the hell why people is hurasing him about it i am SISTER shook of how much hate.......... Do u like getting bullied . so becy betty keasha all whos people giving hate to him youe wasting your time the exit is here leave
I was going to write something but nvm I dont want problems
Thats so dumb of course he filmed it anyone would have lol who cares alot worst things on youtube than that
I personally dont like him, however I dont think he deserves all the hate. No one deserves hate. Hes a human being for crying out loud! Hes not perfect! Yes, I agree he couldve made better choices in making the video, but hes just a person. He tried to raise suicide awareness in his own way.
Hes not funny 
Hes racist
"15M followers on YouTube".
what is that profile pic
I agree that this Logan guy did something wrong
Cautati pe youtube "Bahoi - despre suicid" ... sa vedeti si voi ce e ala un suicid.
Americans sucks...
Kespacito M8 wrong. Just Logan and the people who like him
"15 million *followers* on youtube"
Im Japanese and Im really sad and disappointed with how he treated a dead body disrespectfully.  Also, what he did in Tsukiji and Shibuya disgraced other Youtubers so now a lot of Japanese people think Youtuber as immortal people.
He should be aware of the fact that he is one of the top influencers in the world and how he could affect kids behaviour.
He's stupid.
The thing that gets me is that the entire time he's cracking jokes and acting obnoxious and it's clear that they continued filming for selfish reasons. There was no intent to raise awareness for "suicide victims". In fact, showing graphic content like this is often what pushes a suicidal person over the edge. Think of how many killed themselves after watching '13 Reasons Why'.
I'm pretty sure you shouldn't have posted a video about a person who committed suicide he has so many kid followers it's not even funny teaching more children about suicide might not be the best idea I basically live around death I see it every day and I don't want others seeing the horror of death
HE MESSED WITH THE BODIES WITHOUT PERMISSION
Followers on YouTube 
Seems legit
asshole
15 million FOLLOWERS
HES SO STUPID IMMATURE AND DISRESPECTFUL. Ugh  how do tf do you make fun of suicide incident?
"I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet..."

@Cosmetologeek agreed.
giselle silva You remind me of a 10 year old because they have nothing better to do than troll you tube and use terrible insults. Isnt it past your bedtime? Run along now. 
Riiiight...Didn't want veiws thats why he titled it "WE FOUND A DEAD BODY".....Also yeah makeing fun of a dead person by saying "He doesn't feel too well".....Really raising awareness and being positive!
Me To Him: *Sniff* Smell That....??? 
*Smells Like Bull Poop*
WHAT IS REAL...
BIG DEAL...HE GOT THERE FIRST ...NN.
Wow! Logan Paul really did this? That is really bad! What if the dead person's family and friends saw his video? And Logan's "so sorry" video is faker than James Charles apology video lol
And i missed it
*YUP*
he can suck a dick
Followers on YouTube?
Fuck you bitch
Published on Jan 2, 2018. MOVE THE FUCK ON WITH YOUR LIFE KID!!!!
What the real problem is why they tagged subscribers as followers.
This word is full of people like him and bhad bhabie etc and their gaining so much popularity that its in turn influencing children to be like them, which is NOT what we need these days... we need better people
I'm a maverick
most wanted man for disturbing the peace
"Suicide victim"
He didnt prevent the suicide.. so whats the point
i heard about this guy!! sometimes the content will get obscured!!!!you ave no respect to show a dead body!!!!! its disgusting to show a corpse!!!! you did it for views not for good!!!!
Who raised this fucking nitwit
And you never said what he actually did good job! ;)
Roses are red, Violets are blue, Guess who YouTube's going to sue

People are really getting mad over this??? Wow how stupid is that
@Jerr S you sensitive bitch  it's funny how you think it's the biggest  thing in the world
Andon Amparano uh, yeah
@Jerr S lol nah
Andon Amparano you are if you think its dumb that people got mad.
He did it so he can feel like he has done something good in life even though I'm sure he hasn't
Subscribers dumbass.
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=who+the+hell+cares
I really don't understand why everyone was getting upset about this video tbh... He went to the forest for the haunted aspect it.. I understand laughter as a coping mechanism because I'm like that.. And the persons overlooked his message after finding the body that suicide isn't the answer.
You're a special kind of stupid.
@Joe Feigenbutz how will he know who the family members are?.. he blurred the face
Did he ask the family for permission before uploading the video?
He's not sorry for what he did. He's sorry for the negativity it got.
why do ppl still hate on james charles like jake paul filming a dead body that *"he didnt do for views"*
You didn't even see the body it was way off in the distance.fuckn joke how main stream media try and take a moral high ground and sensationalize something like this...they do far worse daily
they call subscribers "followers" lmao

Using your finger for a like is really sad honey.
Joe Feigenbutz bitch you look special ya ugly ass wit that small ass egg head dh
You're a special kind of stupid.
*How did he not get less subs than James Charles?*
0:41 What?! No sane Teenager would watch that Shit!
I came here after James Charles tati. Who else did?
Why are they calling followers subscribers? Im triggered
Calm down and find your medication little one.
Kinda irritating to hear that female media personality brag about Pauls fortune. We know he is rich! She kept reminding us. 
That video was not a good look for Paul. I would have not included that in the segment. Its poor taste. Self-observation could have prevented this negative fallout! 
People make fatal errors. It is part of life. As long as we learn, we can grow better... Logan has a lot of life left. He will think carefully next time.
Positive Life 
1. Do you realize what goes into making a video like this, editing, creating a thumbnail, watching it a few times, its impossible to not notice the fact that a dead body was shown in the video.
2. Do you realize how many fatal errors him and his brother have made.
dead rat at the suicide forest, DEAD RAT IN THE SUICIDE FOREST
Juanpa
Logan for life 
White Privileged bitch
This is how many punches logan paul gets
hes literally a sociopath, if this was the only thing he ever did wrong, then ok. But hes been shitting on his neighbors lives for 15 years. He will eventually be murdered or put in jail.
That's a fuck ton of punches
Multiply that by 100
@YourNextLineWillBe:IsThatAJojoReference MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
This is 'Unbroken' levels of getting punched in the face many times.
Who cares. Ppl kill themselves everyday. Leave the guy alone
Robert Carpenter and to answer your question on who cares: lots of people do, especially the people who have lost family and friends to suicide. Learn to be more empathic and educate yourself on the matter instead of being an ignorant jackass on the subject.
Robert Carpenter wow, youre a special kind of person, arent you? And by that I mean, dumb and pathetic loser.
the irony is it's twerps like this who end up committing suicide themselves in about 5 years when their C-List fame comes to a crashing halt (i can't wait for it)
Followers on YouTube lmaooooo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w
OK so he says he did it for suicide prevention.... BUT LAUGHS!!!!!!!!! AMERICAN IDIOTS
I remember when I saw him upload it. I ignored it bc I thought that he was pranking.
This is the first time I heard of this dude and I'm always on YouTube
Good for you. You didn't miss anything important
I'm so fucking jealous of you right now
Who came here after the James Charles vs Tati
I actually did
Wtf, this section is full 0 iq thots
Rouge -_- why does that matter
He couldve just became a lawyer...
But NOOOO he HAS to be the most hated person on the Internet
Im not leaving the sisterhood over vitamins and other people being sheeps. He wayyyy too funny to unsub too
What about james Charles
Whats the big deal! He went into the SUICIDE FORREST! He found a body! It happens!
Jason Gentry yes, it happens. But not everyone is an idiot and films someone who just killed themselves. Why dont you morons get that?
I say this tongue in cheek. But there should have been a few murders in the suicide forest when that video was filmed. They were probably even poking the corpse with a stick when the camera was off.
******g get off his back already and stop busting his b****.
YouTube please take off this  YouTube. Because everyone trying to forget about . Everyone is trying to forget about it. Please 
Those who forget the past are destined to repeat it.
Nah I think the dead body is killed by Japanese monsters
You are honestly retarded
am i the only one who is kinda annoying that she said followers and not subscribers
This is why I watch Jake Paul. At least his fake "Attack of the Killer Clowns" series was fun to watch. Not a dead body which Logan found amusing.
I hate Logan
People
This 
Completely 
Idotic

Same Logan Paul sucks
@EliteSpeartonYT UltimateModder what do you mean with my grammar? What's wrong?
@Normal Person your grammar too and it's creepy for kids so we take crap out of him
Kasey#kkbff Rodriguez idiot
It is not that big of a deal chill people!
Tell that to the victims family.
where tf is the body
He filmed it in the video he posted a year ago. He went up to it showing at hands, the body being limp the only thing he blurred was the face and that's it.
the only mockery you're making Is of yourself because no one with any degree of common sense thinks this is funny in any way.
I intended to raise awareness for suicide prevention.
 YUUUP
Parents, this is why you shouldn't leave your children on the internet unsupervised.
He has 15 million followers on youtube.....
Its a sucide forest...
so WHAT TO EXPECT
ali qr65 I cant tell if youre being sarcastic because this is fucking sick.
dear haters:
https://youtu.be/dxa6FM9E1jI
Yes we can't hate someone for not only filming a dead body but also laughing at it, nice one you fucking degenerate.
I ended up getting a notification from him wit that video at the second I saw it I just deleted youtube
No you didn't. You're still here fuck face...
He did it for the fucking money
look, did you see it? No. 
No picture no proof.
@Kauri 798 For a matter a fact, there are re-uploaded videos of the original one. So I agree with you.
If you saw his original video then you'll see it, you disrespectful dipshit.
He's a moron. He found a body in the suicide forest...NEVER
To be honest other youtubers have probley seen stuff like this but not been like him and be so fucking disraspectful and wip out the camera and started videoing because they achally know its wrong to post this stuff and it's so disraspectful for the person that achally died he wasn't trying to show ewernes for suicide I feel so sorry for they family member for that person and show my deepest sympathy.
Is statement on "raising awareness" is bullshit.
when do these pauls make a suicide prevention video when these stupid fam just make crazy stupid videos to get views I mean his just  giving us reasons
"I did it to raise awareness, not of views."
Oh BULL SH*T
He doesn't seriously expect people to buy that, does he?
He gives youtubERS (Not youtube because they allowed that to be posted and waited for him to take it down if you hadn't already realised)a bad name.
Though I will acknowledge that there are some pretty toxic people on this platform.
@Andon Amparano wtf
@Andon Amparano your just a other fan boy you fucking 12 year old
@Andon Amparano your grammar explains how you're a toddler.
@question mark you're calling me a toddler how you're funny maybe you should go go back to your mother's basement you fat diabetic
Everyone is so angry about Logan showing the dead body. 
Honestly, I'm more pissed about how ridiculously disrespectful he was throughout the rest of the video. 
That was the first video I watched of Logan Paul and it was my last.
The Japanese guy obviously wanted everyone to see his dead body. This guy just walked into suicide forest and committed suicide. What a clout chaser smh
Seriously not funny you fucking idiot.
logan sucks
WHY ARE PPL GETTING SO OFFENDED!
How would you feel that somebody you cared about hanging from a tree and post it on the internet from millions to see?
Why the fuck do you think you fucking illiterate Bitch!
Logan Paul in Auschwitz: Dab on them nazis
Jarno Datema 
I hope this guy burns in hell!!
i used to be a logangster.
WTF Waht is wrong in hear
Logan Paul I hope you die in hell!
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR VIEWS, I GET VIEWS.
Well not from us.
Japan's suicide levels are high!
Many people kill themselves a lot...
That is why *Suicide* Forest is very popular as ut name says it!!!
Yall over reacting
Yeah you're right we're overreacting over him showing a dead body to 12 year olds and under. If you can't tell I'm being sarcastic because it seems like you're a little mind can't handle that.
You're an actual fucking idiot.
He's Joke. He only apologize to keep his fame going. It's shame how he still Youtuber icon.
its a rip in the chat bois
Stopid
Suicide Forest: I about to end this whole man's career
The jokes just impulse him 
Ranjana Nixon im your 999th like hehe
Samantha Fernandez I literally said that wasnt the point of the video but yes it was disrespectful
@Saltt ll Yes its totally not disrespectful to laugh at a dead person.
Logan should confess his sins
Followers it's subscribers
I'm sure ABC News anchorman is concerned rather if its followers or subscribers.
Tfhcu
Idk,, im definitely in the minority,m but i dont understand whats wrong with this, no, im not 9, but i do havce messed up morals, i dont see whats dis respectful about showing a dead body, please inform me.
@Cyberrr have you watched the original video?
Joe Feigenbutz yeah, I can understand that, but some people are saying he was mocking the body
He didn't have permission from the family to show it.
Sorry, i never got to watch hisd video, how did he mock the body?
You know when you fucked up when Hollywood celebrities diss you.
Who else thinks Logans video should have more dislikes than YouTube Rewind?
Hollywood celebrities stars really hates Logan
He makes about 12 to13 million. Can u people stop like what are u people
"He makes about 12 to13 million. Can u people stop like what are u people"
What's wrong with social media in a nutshell.
The reporter said 'FOLLOWERS on youtube' 
THAT ANNOYS ME 
He made a mistake
One that he easily could of fixed.
15 million *F O L L O W E R S*
Dont put this on the news
Everyone's a pussy he just made a video maybe they shouldn't have killed them selves? Maybe people need to stop being pussies like y'all mad cuse your not him making that money he does everyone on here probely has no life or someshit pathetic
Says the person who has no life and, is living it through a YouTuber.
2019??
Top YouTuber in the world looks like pewdiepie is going to lose 71 million subscribers
Even if he did stop recording people would be like Why did you stop recording we wanna see the dead person
Only idiots wanna see dead person
I saw a dead body at a funeral
15 million followers on youtube
lol its called subscribers but ok 
yeah no I hate this kid whY is he apologizing after thAt?
first off all if u learn the about the forrset  japan is a place where u cant show u emothion there is plenty of ppl going there killing themself because they cant show there emotion because familys would think its shamefull so i really dont find it rude for him to post this other pppl went there and recored it so please
Dumbasses used the term allegedly even though THERES PROOF AND ITS A FACT
Bruh, he couldve just cut it out in editing.
Like PewDiePie about that Fiverr video.
Moral lesson, dont upload it or regret it.
crazy people
Bro why do they have suicide park or forest in Japan.
This is why I am not that shocked about the outcome of his video. The initial problem is having a forest that is not only known for suicide as a tradition, but popularizing its name to tourists too.
FBI Suicides are common in Japan. Now please dont tell me to open up.
They lost their will to live, theyre depressed, they dont wanna live again...
Dont talk about because Im a good bitch
Reporter:15 million followers on youtube
Me:Da phuc
I didn't do it for views NIGGA YOUR FUCKING YOUTUBE VIDEO TITLE EXPLAINS IT
I love how the news sounds so concerned about his influence on the audience... like bich everyone memes on him
He didnt have to publish the video though
Edit: but he still did
How about people just get the fuck over it?? People today seem to be so thin-skinned that they can't deal with reality.
@Joe Feigenbutz javole!
Telling people to get over something that happened 1 year and 4 months ago is stupid. The only people who can't get over it are Logan Paul keyboard warriors
Wow. Did you think of that all by yourself?
@Joe Feigenbutz ...and? Btw why joe feigenbutz? Was fred fredburger already taken?
Says the person who came here 1 year and 4 months after the video was posted.
First tell me why his face so big huge and square like sponge bob why he applies lipstick make-up
Using Death for business America
I TOLD yall Logan Paul SUCKSSS
Wowww
15 million followers on YouTube
logan looks likes a inside out testicle
I FOUND A DEAD BODY AT A GRAVEYARD!
i don't mind what he did tho
midoriya Izuku why? Cause youre a total ass-kisser of Logan? Pathetic
Joe Feigenbutz and society in general.
"i don't mind what he did tho" And that ladies and gentlemen is what's wrong with social media.
Why tf is this in my recommended
The Paul Brothers are the worst and their fans are cringey
One day when someone close to him dies he'll realize how wrong this was..what an immature fuck  there's literally children in these comments that have more knowledge than him
Hes subsribers are gonna unsubscribe hime t.b.h
I saw the video... He didn't do anything extreme or bad.. he did what a 22 year old would do...called police ... Talked about the craziness of the experience... Etc
Ms Twentythirteen like I said, Im not crying. But nice talking to you and I hope youre not an asshole to everyone that replies to your comments
@Jerr S stop crying to me about this... I don't care... Time to move along son... Don't forget your tissues.
Ms Twentythirteen hmm...so youre just an obnoxious outsider looking in and giving your lame opinion? Ok. And would you stop with the crying crap? Like you, Im giving my opinion too. Im not crying about anything, youre just being annoying.
@Jerr S I don't know what garbage he rants about on YouTube I've never heard of him until now... And as an outsider looking in I stick to my opinion... *Throws a crying towel to jerr s
Ms Twentythirteen youre not defending him, and yet you said he didnt do anything extreme or bad. Psh, BS I dont buy it. And Im not crying about your opinion, Im merely giving you mine as to why its stupid to say he didnt do anything wrong, when he clearly did.
Tbh We all expected Logan Paul was gonna do some dumb shit sooner or later. What he did was f*cked up his channel deserves to get taken down.
i see the dead bodyyyy no censored...
ima kid and why would i like this guy??!! he offended one of my fav countries!
Hey fuck all of you who are still on the Logan Paul Aokigahara forest controversy, this is old, he has improved and been doing all that he can to entertain and be more family friendly, he has matured over the year and you all need to just back down and put this Aokigahara forest controversy to rest
Retro Skill Vlogs 0x0 shut up you ignorant moron. Its sad that you obnoxious fans are still pathetic enough to defend him over the offensive crap he did. And hes not trying to be more family friendly, hes getting away from that.
I bet 999,999,999 he's gonna do this again
It's called suicide forest and he did a video about it.....
In my opinion the suicide victim looked fake. But either way fake or real you shouldnt film it. Besides, all of his content is useless!
A year later in 2019 and everyone over the mental age of 13 still hates this guy. I know I will never forgive him for disrespecting the dead, making it harder for YouTubers, and Americans who want to see Japan. This also shows you how much YouTube needs to fix their system because it took them almost a week to take that video down but a few hours to take down a false flagged video? Hopefully that guidelines strike will put some brian cells in his head...oh wait, it didn't.
Now 1 year later he jokes about that hes gonna be gay for the month 
He was born gay. Nobody cares. He's old news...
Oh hi I am Logan Paul!  
I AM GONNA SHOULD LITTLE KIDS DEAD PEOPLE 
WTF HE US SO F###### WRONG!
Happy new year
Wow She Called A Subscribers A Follower.. what's this Twitter?
Even though i dont like Logan Paul
I could understand why he made that video
Its because he wanted to show people that suicide isnt a joke
OMG why dose everyone think he's a bad person he's a Savage he's a nice person I'm a mavrik
Go ahead, kid. Be a maverick all you want because one day, you will get arrested for being a maverick. And if you think murder makes you a maverick, get some help.
But suicide is a joke
logan paul:i saw a dead guy 
in phone:suicide victim
me:this is disgusting
*2019?*
Ah, yet another idiotic thing done by one of the Paul brothers.
Wait, I get this guy is retarded and cringy, but everyone's this mad because in a video he recorded a dead guy?
You suck so so so so much because you talk crap
Finally they tell how Logan Paul sucks;)
Because he was a stupid motherfucking bitchh
No one watch you bitch
Nobody likes logan or jake  paul
Hahah i hate him and i will forever will
@When You're Home Alone thanks for pointing that out
@WM70 oof
@When You're Home Alone I saw nothing
@WM70 put your phone upside down 
@When You're Home Alone ok at least you forgive him. 
what's so bad about filming a dead body, give actually arguments and i'll respond
This makes me sick to the stomach thats just disgusting and horrible how he showed a body what if the guys family seen the think of how they would feel seeing their Husbent,Dad,Brother,son s dead body all over the internet I think he needs some respect I bet he lost a lot of fans
I dont get how pep still believe this. It was fake it was a paid actor..
First of all just stop it now I don't have time for shit like this or u and I'm not saying that he did the right thing but really people over one little mistake like people out here getting kill and u still and shit 2018 stop so IF U CAN'T SHUT The FUCK UP Please
Sophie truvi fucking sucks
Yea I have 1 follower on YouTube
Idk why im looking back at all of these videos
I'm here cuz a new issue made by my country youtube star qorygore doin the same thing, even worst than logan paul at suicide forest japan..he's now known as logan paul ver.2.0..how dumb is he
Forget my other comment, IDC if I'm late...
I hated him even before that video. when I saw that video I was full of anger like "he can't do that I mean sure he is a YouTube star but he can't film a dead body or something like that. Suicide is a big deal and we don't need anyone dying! #SuicidePrevention #STOP #DONTDOIT #FINDHELP #LetsMakeAChange #OurLivesMatter
He didn't show the body. It was blurred out. Stop hiding real life issues that happen in this world.
I really hate people who suicides
hes probably got subscribers on facebook!!! Get it?
Yes because he got a follower on youtube
The funniest thing is he saying that he wants to protect the people from suicide but in the video he laughs at the body how dare he because that's Someone's Child like you can shut the video down and call someone call the Japanese police like like what is going inside his head in like going to get so many views because of this video Logan Paul it backfired so I don't know what he was thinking but he did the wrong thing
You guys don't mess with my f****** Jake Paul or Logan Paul
Fernando Ybarra stfu
Come on let me tell you japan people actually do wrong thing and suicide themself and stop talking that and fuck you japan for it
What's even more enraging is the fact that YouTube didn't give a crap, even though it must have been flagged at least a billion times. Logan had to take the video down himself.
I have no idea what his video was.. but from what little I could learn from this news-report, I can only point out the hypocrisy of a news-agency making this report. Are you making some sort of claim that all your stories have merit, respect people's privacy and feelings, etc?..
Do you say that you never have a news story on anything that can be considered a tragedy?.. 
do you say that all your stories have value?.. and that you don't let "likes" (or as you call it "ratings") affect what you show?.. 
I don't know much about ABC News, as I am not from your country, but.. If you do make these claims, I'll call BULLSHIT.. 
News broadcasts often ignore important stories because they suspect they might not be popular, while showing stories because of the "scoop" value.. or the rubber-necking value.,.. and you rarely ask everyone involved if it's okay.. I don't might not know ABS-news, but if you want to claim you never ever showed video or photographs, f.ex. from a war zone.. you know.. a place where people are dying.. (and this would be people who DIDN'T chose it themselves).. because you think it would be important for your ratings..?.. I seriously doubt it... 
I remember when I took media studies and learned that "public interest"- when deciding whether something is news-worthy- meant what was in the public's interest to know.. not.. "whatever the public might be interested to hear, plus whatever our sponsors and owners wants us to promote".
.. pot.. kettle.. black..
dude that \guy just said *Got rot in hell* thats scary as fuck
Both of them Paul brothers are fucking idiots
how was this already 10 months ago
Hey hey hey whats wrong with you guys, isnt right he make video like this. You guys should think carefully, without logan this body cannot be found and stay hang in there maybe bocomes bones, and logan never make jouke in that video, as you guys can see he shock to see the death body, and he never make a jouke when he saw that body and why you scoding people without wrong reason, and i know its not for publish but at that moment he not know, even that in youtube guiding line. 
Why you guys hate him just because he found the death body
Guys if know one uploaded a video with a real dead body but Logan Paul was the only one who did he wouldnt know so at least give him a chance also just get over with this now, this was ages ago
you guys need to focus on your business. Talk about you to talk about something that you guys could pick on cuz that is not your business don't talk about Jake Paul and don't talk about Logan because that is respectful and that chooses their mom and dad being being sad and mad at them so you can focus on your business English and cuz of KSI and daddy is like Logan Jake is a good boy jerk everything when it rains it does not rain so I don't know what you guys are talking about your business and don't not focus on his business
And than KSI saves his career
Are you still watching but now I actually watched in the past so
Solution: STOP USING YOUTUBE AS A BABYSITTER FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!!!
Knew something bad I mean really bad something that can get you arrested bad
You Guys Need To Lay off of Logan Paul SMH 
YouTube never took his channel down
LOGAN PAUL NEEDS TO BE LOCKED UP SUCIDADE IS NO JOKE
Fucking Logan Paul gaijins go back to your Walmart country

You are idiot
LOL TFIL found a dead body there before him LOL
What a narcissistic piece of shit. Sorry but this man is a idiot.
This guy is a jackass
This will forever stay with him for the rest of his life as a constant reminder as to what he did was unforgettable and unforgivable.
SUICIDE IS NOT SOMETHING TO MAKE FUN OF! THERE MIGHT BE KIDS SUFFERING RIGHT NOW OF THIS AND GOING OUT THERE AND MAKING FUN OF IT?! WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU!
Logan Paul.
He cunt.
Logan and Jake can fuck off to hell!
And I saw that video
Kinda dont believe you about the apology but ok

Bro he really doesn't care. He's only sorry because he got caught.
U wanted to make something positive...out of suicide?Nothing good comes from suicide and his channel should be taken down
I hope he dies in a ditch.
Aaaaaahh I love it

Jesus I do not like him at all 
The clickbait is what started the cancer that troom troom is
This is why I hate the Paul's.

Ok person too self concious to show face

Good thing Ksi is about to beat his ass *Don't worry Kids KSI will help us*
That ship has sailed buddy, logan beat his ass
The thing is, Logan and jake Paul, despite technically being adults, are basically just kids. adults who is not mature.
This bitch didn't even censor the body.
@r_ven OG so did i???
Dumbass, I meant Logan Paul.
He did...
Why a news station would give this idiot any form of recognition or attention baffles me.
stupid american do stupid thingcome to Malaysia make film I will go airport to find you and then kill you with my knifefucker american
Joseph Feigenbutz bla bla bla... Agree and disagree, for this moment, u guys are responsible that vote for donald trump and make fun with different cultures , mess up all around the world with others nation, totally not funny at all

Superman and Kiaski did you seriously just say that in August? 
What a douche
logans paul fans are DEFENDING HIS ACTIONS!!!!!!! which i see some of those kind of people in the comment section and making videos of themselves talking about logan paul didnt do anything. this world is cruel ;(
It's 15 million subscribers not followers
Oh hell no
Boo he shouldn't have done that
If this amerika they probably only cared about paul mocking japanese
Fuck Logan Paul! He is an idiot and unfortunately, Jake Paul is turning out like him.
The ladie is correct it is growing up problem he is still young and must be mature of this.
This is why Japan Bombed pearl Harbor
1:42 oh really now?
He aint a star he is a loser
2018 is gonna be a great year! *logan finds a dead body in Japan suicide forest* maybe 2019 will be better...
It's subscribe not followers
Hes also really disrespectful
If it was Nelk things would've been different
ive looked so hard and i cant find any hanging person
1:58 Lets talk up Logan Paul at the end of the video.
Then I think  #pepsi are wiser who they gonna support.
Lmao bet the suicide was one of Logans viewers
15 million *followers* on *YouTube*
Yup ok
O no all my kids history is filled of twerk compilations and ufc badasses fighting.
Tell that cunt to get a proper job! BAN HIM!
He is down right discussting and fucked up
You disgress Logan disgusts me He doesn't deserve his subs
It was not a mistake. He had the time to edit the video didnt he
Welcome to America
Wait so in that video he put a dead body on camera, put it in the thumbnail, and laughed while filming a human being that took their life, disrespected that whole area of China that he was told not to go in and disobeyed anyways! To "Raise attention and suicide awareness!"
Wow and the apology TOTALLY makes up for that 
Whats kinda sad is that his bird logo thing is so cool and I would totally buy a hoodie of it if it wasnt related to Logan Paul
Subscribers not Followers
LOGAN PAUL F#$*ING SUCKS!!! HE HAS TO GET KICKED OUT OF YOUTUBE
I WATCHED THAT VIDEO IM SCARED FOR LIFE
I still forgive him 
Kelanie Studio  I'm judging you I'm judging you I'm judging you. What a shame
don't judge me 
God has left you..
Can somone sub to me
OOF!!
I dont care how many times he says hes sorry he is just an idiot and does careless acts for views.
Thats why I dont watch Logan paul.
TFIL was there to
Why is he still on youtube. Why no consequenses for him? When will karma strike back?
When clickbait goes too far...
He didn't piss on a body he didn't make fun of anyone... Why are people being such panzies
Longan is a dumb head idiot
Shut up
I a am not ever going to watch Logan Paul again
..... (sigh) im just very disappointed in u logan ...just very disappointed. .
i want to see it
i saw the dead body found on suicide forest video from logan paul and i was gonna watch it again to make sure it wasnt fake but it was deleted
15 million *followers* on YouTube... Isnt it called *subscribers?*
I DON'T CARE how popular he is or what kind of car he drives. I despise shitty people and I will NOT support one.
Get fucked
*followers on youtube.*
Logan balls
This is unbelievable. He is so popular even after all of this. He makes bad music videos too. That suicide victim probably went through a lot. Suicide is not something to mess with. He is so disrespectful to the people and country that I hold so close to my heart, that I feel sad, embarrassed, angered, and horrified after what he has done. Why does he have so much support? He doesn't care for animals (he made a dog ride a zip line which could be fatal if the dog fell out and scared it out of its mind when held up to a baby tiger), he disrespects the culture, religion, and the people of Japan (the suicide video, running around with an octopus arm and fish and leaving on a random taxi, screaming in a temple, etc) and is just stupid on top of that. I really wish that he would just stop. I feel heartbroken when I saw him disrespecting my home, and the most important place in my life. The people who greeted him with smiles and just tried to be nice were just shoved away. They tried being so kind, but he just... I just can't. He's terrible. If he could just stop...
Paul Logan is a liar!
Paul Logan is disgusting!  He does not know if that would happen in his family
Wait he showed the body!?
I don't watch him but I ALREADY think he's dumb because writes apolge say I didn't do it for the views SAYS THE PERSON THAT USES DEAD BODY in the thumbnail
Omg other YouTubers have done the same exact thing. In fact I watched the video on LiveLeak, Logan and his friends were in shock, some people react differently then others do. I do believe the close up shot of the victim probably wasnt the smartest thing to do. 
I was not bothered by the video at all, Ive desensitized to death, I worked in the medical field for years, so Ive become use to watching people die even taking their last breath afterwards I even washed the dead bodies. I worked in Hospice care in a nursing home so you have a choice to either get use to it or get another job.
He makes me sick The Poor man he filmed I cant Even imagen His pain I have tried to kill myself I am A survived I was lucky
0:36 in youtube there are subscribers not followers!
i dont understand.
IT'S NOT FOLLOWERS IT'S subscribers
He has 15Million followers 
Logan is so retarted
WOW I CANT BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY FOUND A *DEAD* BODY IN THE *SUICIDE* FOREST!!! what a fucking idiot logan paul is. Go to hell. What you did is not fucking funny.
I hope ksi beats logan
Logan Paul why would you do that. That is not  funny  at all what if your friend or family member did suicide would you laugh no right so show some respect for the people who did suicide!!!!!!!!
hey you he have 17 million subscribers on you tube.
Not entertaining at all
lol guys if you stop at 2:16
Logan Paul made a huge mistake. Hope he took it down
How would he know ?
This is an American ... There is not any word. . .
Subscribe please 8 Bit Gamer and thank you
It's just he's hyper
okay so what if he put a dead body it was not on purpose
Not sure tho, I hate suicidal victim too. It kinda neutralise me....
parents shouldn't let their kids this guy
I believe that everyperson that walks into that forrest is hoping to find a dead body...for excitement or shock value. as far as Logan showing "the guy" on tape...he was hyped up and shocked. Time to get over it. We are still allowed to watch those unfortunate souls jumping to their deaths from twin towers 9/11. dead bodies on the news and documentaries. Seeing the face doesnt make it any worse for me. just let it go.
His lucky
Well it is indeed called
Suicide forest
I hate him so he is stupid i hate him so much u are  mean
SREW YOU LOGAN YOU MAKE ME SICK
Everyday i dream of me killing him with a new weapon everyday the first day was shooting him with a clocl
Hes not a star, hes a f*cking Idiot who should not be a Youtuber at all! Its people like him that take away from all the good things on YouTube with his Stupid F*ckboy self!
And the only reason its the first time a victim of suicide is on YouTube is because everyone else has the Fucking Decency  stop recording and pay their god damn respects. Logan Paul is not a Youtuber, he is a F*cking A*s!
Be safe
Logan Paul is my favorite my classmate told me this my classmate watch Logan Paul
Shut the fuck up you punk ass kid...
Wow thats crazy I would be scared if I saw that 
Wow, I never knew I would be on the Television?!?!? Thanks for all the views
You're fake, dude.
He needs to get a punched in the face and kicked off YouTube that goes for jack Paul and rice gum
50:00
99:09
He deserves that his humour is retarded i even feel uncomfortable watching him
who is jake Paul?
He doesnt give a fuck
hoo ever called jake paul a ediet they isstupid
15 million followers on youtube
Wel this post are back again
Abc.  Always broadcasting cancer
All YouTube stars should kill themselves.
I think that we all make mistakes and that we should forgive Logan Paul for his.. Okay? We did a lot to cover up and make admins for what he did..
*" A P P A R E N T "* suicide
I hope Logan is OK
Jake Paul and Logan Paul are both massive c##ts
Ok so if you want to make a flipping negative comment on someone,why don't you just keep it to yourselves. It does not feel good  for some one to make you feel like trash. Now, Logan Paul took down the freaking video and can y'all stop acting like dipwads and be the bigger one to keep sh*t to ur own freaking self
oh wow
FU$& YOU logan
HE NEEDS TO GO TO HELL
2018, here we come...
Please, someone help me, I am so depressed for my terrible aspergers life I'm within 3 hours to decide wether to kill myself!!!
even kids know suicide is heavy subject.where this logan pig put his brain??
At least in Japan culture accept suicides. In Church controlled Middle Aged vulgar and bigoted Europe suicide victims used to have an ignominious burial and the confiscation of the property. Now, at least there is a tribute to those gentle souls who refuse to adjust to the world where the heart must either break to turn to lead.
The memes the were made tho
"Top entertainment influencers in the world" but he's not entertaining...
And he's not influencing
To you
Lets play Hypixel SW ._.
Your opinion, kids like him like I do
Just think he edited that for hours maybe even days and not once did this cross his mind
"I intended it raise awareness for suicide and suicided prevention...". WHAT A LIE!!!!
Another YouTuber found a dead body and that YouTuber was Vjamahh
Mom:your not going to watch logan paul anymore
Me:I don't care I'm still watching him

Boiii you gotta be Lit
Thing is that country gave the forest for that reason. Think about it,  there's no nice place to die anyway, but the gvment actually gave the forest as tranquillity, better than in the family house where families are...it sounds mad but they DO leave the dead at the very scene for days and loved ones make a sort of shrine with flowers and cards....HE KNEW HE WOULD FIND ONE..... I dunno if you know, but the Japanese police have a warent for his arrest.....
That is messed up bro
i seriously dont know how youtube allows this dude to keep making content.. i seriously posted just a couple of links to a website and now im banned from youtube for ever this dude posted a vid of a dead body and his channel is still up
He is a fucking idiot!
You abc should not be doing this you abc make your own im not gonna subcribe this stupid abc i only subcride logan paul
*LOGAN PAUL OUR BOI*
Logan and jake Paul both suck
I don't get it is his name Logan Paul or Jake Paul and is he human or Roblox
he's logan paul and he's a disabled human and has fans of stupid 12 year old fans who thinks anything he does is funny even if he is killing people, his 12 year old fans will think that's funny. yep society has gone to hell my friend
how can something positive come from a man who took his own life?
THIS ISNT THE REAL PAUL I KNOW!! 
Other people have posted suicides from this forest, more than one suicide video, so why are people jumping all over this fellow? Also when you commit suicide you leave yourself open to those left behind, when you are dead you no longer need protection so what's the big deal?
Debra Kerkkonen yeah his a psychopath. Theres much worser than logan paul and things accessable to this internet thats unaccessacle. And thats life you might have weird friends or your close family member died
Myke Plaz Logan Paul may not have made a good choice here but people, kids included have access to a lot of horrible things on line these days,
some targeted for kids. Life and death issues, people's strange attitudes etc...are just a part of everyday life. To me people tearing living people's lives apart is much worse yet people do it all the time.
Debra Kerkkonen he disrespected a body by joking about it and he didn't cut the part where the dead body is. He knows his audience is full of kids and just shows it.
.....
Thats Bullshit Logan.
Wrong!!!
How people should react to the popular series on netflix. smh.
He is a dick
I really did look up to Logan
...SCREE HIM
He, Jake Paul, is a terrible person.
Whatever I h8 Logan
Where is the dead body though
Even if it is fake or a stage thing people do hang them self in woods thats y I would never go to one
Half of YouTube hates this guy.
Lie...
More reasons why Logan paul is a dumbass like his brother.
finally ppl agrees with meh
Lol all the the Jake Pualers jumping on this to say more reasons why hes terrible.
Popular stars.....
That is lie
WELL NO DA THAT HE WOULDNT ITS CALLED SUICIDE FOREST
youtube should have the option to block a channel, stupid ones like this Logan, his stupid videos can bring kids to an dangerouse situations.
I like  logan poual!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok he messed up live from that it was a missdue so when yall do somthing its all right so stop
no sory 4 u lougain pul
tf you're still here
I hope Logan is kicked off of YouTube for good!! There was no need for what he did!! He was already making a ton of cash but I guess that wasn't enough, now he wanted to try and get famous too, by making fun of dead people just for views!!
Fuck you guys all day.
Unsubscribe to logan subscribe to jake paul
Ok so me and my friend Julie were watching YouTube then my friend Bailey called us and was like did you see Logan Pauls video of the sucide forest and when we went to find it we couldnt cause all the vids were blocked until we found one

LOGANG :O kids and adults and teens pre kids. Watch this
fuck u I said he's a stupid ass in the idiot
he makes america great again in japan :P
Who honestly still likes the Paul brothers! Like seriously their idiots
I try to tell my cousin that he is stupid dumb and ignorant but it never works *sigh*
Ew mah gawwwhhd dey just say FOLLOWERS instead of Subscribers ??? Oh my Jesus hit pause on the world. We gotta fix this enormous life stopping issue. I think I need a power nap and a Capri Sun. The world is such an awful place.
logan paul is trash
Logan Paul is a 5 year old child instead of a 22 year old man. Not surprised the he played with a dead body.
IT'S NAME IS SUICIDE FOREST
This guy is so stupid
Fuck logan paul
I never watched the video so im all good
From hearing the comments, you all are such pussies I swear, the jokes weren't even anywhere near as bad as people made them out to be, showing a dead body is a bit graphic but dam its not the end of the fucking world, also he was telling a few MINOR jokes because he was horrified on what he had seen and wanted to feel better, that being said to clear a few things up, I do have a lot of sympathy for the poor man that committed suicide, I'm no Logan Paul fan but seriously grow a fucking pair of balls.
It wasnt a fuckin prank at all, and even if it was, thats sicker...... There was 2 new suicides found yesterday, a woman and a man...but the police wait for families to report mispers.
Everyone gonna ignore? Her saying 15 million "followers"
Wow good  for him he's on the news! I hope he get arrested
Do they even know this isn't twitter it's YT no it isn't followers it's subscribers
free publicity without having to get a sex change:)
Welp! There goes his 15 minutes...!
Someone needs to beat some sense into this guy
Omfg raising awareness YOU DONT GO FILM A DEAD PERSON FOR AWARENESS wtf is wrong with him
"15 million FOLLOWERS"
on YOUTUBE
Ohhh yeah and how did they know are they a big fan of Jake Paul
It's not Logan's fault he found a dead body and nervously laughed about it, he didn't know how to act around a dead body it's his first time and he was nervous and scared.  So stop blaming him he doesn't know how to reacts idiots.  If he wasn't there nothing would have happened but no one would have found the body anyway so I guess he deserved his YouTube Channel back.  Everyone looks up to him but after that video people left him because of that, I feel bad for the guy I mean he looked like he was in tears and depression after of what happened, so please just give him a chance and make his life better by going to his channel and subbing.  He needs all the support he can get by all you logangsters but if you still hate him why comment on his videos anyway? what's the point of hating on him? Just Let his life be and forgot you knew him its that simple.  I am glad for those people seeing this and rethinking about hating on him Let's make this world a better place.  Are you with me? If your not just leave and don't say anything alright?  Don't make this harder than it has to be.
He is 23 not 22
Jakerika fans comes true - cool Logan Paul finds a dead body-IT THE END OF THE WORlD
idk why everyone is mad at jake paul for doing this.  he is a fucking maverick and he did absolutley nothing wrong.  dead ppl asked for this when  they kill themselves
This is what happened in emojis 
Logan paul sucks so baaaaaaaad 
intention is important. if suicide was discussed with a matter of fact view with the intention of informing others, it's different than disrespecting a dead man's body to get attention. his apology is bullshit too, he's not sorry at all. he never admit what he did was wrong, he still pretends to act all innocent and a victim in this. it's disgusting
-_- srsly DANTDM HAS 18MILION SUBS SO UHH DAN HAS MORE SUBS
Now he has 17 mill
Pity him everyone. Calm down everyone. This is a growing experience for him. He is very sorry he did what he did. 
Let's learn to forgive
Yeah, sorry buddy. Little late for April Fools.
I used to think jake Paul was the dumb one. But you know how to make Logan know he did something wrong?
I'm a make pauler....m
Culo cagao
If he cared he wouldnt act the way he does . Its about money always ! Hes pathetic and its sad he is an icon . He regret it because he got negative backlash from Hollywood and his publicist and lawyer said apologize.  Logan Paul is the biggest popular joke of 2018 and the longest standing april fools joke of all time . His quote " I get views " says in itself he didnt care .
This is not a growing up experience. This is not a 'mistake'. If no one had called him out on this he wouldn't have felt a shred of remorse. Logan Paul is a sociopath and does not deserve a second chance
Logan Paul did not laugh at suiside soooo SO STOP SAYING THAT
Rethink while filming 
Rethink while editing 
Rethink while uploading 
The idiot got that much time to rethink the action but yes did it anyway.
survival bros outdoors Is just a troll guys, stop feeding him
LoL Darth Ynot he literally saw a suicide in a suicide forest tho
Mathieu Lafreniere 
If its fake it makes the whole video ten times worst,
He was willing to fake a dead body and show it to kids for money
He did nothing wrong
Logan Paul is a fucking disgrace to this platform and he deserves the backlash he got
@Rqa0 Yeah exactly you clown
@Rqa0 lmao this was a month ago where have you been? Under a rock? 
My is  name is ashley amezola logan made a mistake he didnt know to to react. They never saw a dead body people are not perfect and logan made a mistake that i forgive hime to
How come he can't get a second chance like everybody else did look at the people who already got murdered by somebody and they're still walking free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In japan killing ur self when ur not feeling good about ur self or when youve done something bad in life and just killing ur self in general is actually something good in Japan it shows respect
my name is logan........
Did they really have nothing else to report on?  The.  Fuck.
Whats the big deal?
He SUCKS ................. that is soooooo sick he and his friend are just laughing and thats just how he gets over depression if he went to a funeral would he just laugh and make jokes...........SICK
sure  he made a mistake but hate wont solve anything , i was once suicidal myself, and Logan's videos actually helped me through it so  i forgive you Logan just think before you post next time.
How the fuck does joking about a suicide while in the presence of it spread awareness of it? If anything it's just spreading awareness of how stupid pricks like you shouldn't have access to technology.
IS THIS AMERIKA PLEASE ITS JAPAN HIS FAULT TO CREATE THAT FORREST OF LIVE LOL SUCIDE FORREST ITS AN JAPANESE SHAME NOT LOGAN S FAULT I LAUGH MY CRAZY OF THE JOKE SUCIDE FORREST WAHAHAHAHA
That is not Fanny so why did you laugh
Boycott!
Very disrespectful and disappointing at the same time.
Oh no.
logan is not a bad guy
Logan...how dare you just how dare you! I hope you rot in hell grrr....you are such a pig all you want is views I always hated Logan anyways and what I REALLY hate is why make fun of that body he said if I recall 'Im not wasing my time on a moonspoon of negtivity` that is so...so...SO cruel my teacher has a friend who taken her own life and he is making fun of this guy imagine he taken his life and someone laughed at him his family would cry but what I hate is that he os STILL MAKING VIDS HE NEEDS TO STOP IT SAME WITH HIS BROTHER! They are desprate for money curse them both and why I hate Jake Paul to is because he makes fun of the Dobre brothers they are both cruel and need to take down their channel!
Who is Logan..? I keep seeing him in Youtubers video........*search up and watch like 1sec* oh.....But Im not a fan sorry.
Fuck u abc news Don't touch my fortnite
I don't get why he went in there.
If he went in to a "SUICIDE FOREST" of course he's going to see a dead body 
This tells me that Logan does not have a brain!
@Vlad Constantinescu you're an idiot
@Bee Queen qwq first of all its called a metaphor and second of all i really think your username fits you cause your acting like a baby right now
i am saying this to *Evie Dale *
omg first he went there only for content second if you go there you will don't find dead bodyes everywhere  and FOR THE PEOPLES WHO DON'T KNOW THAT THE DEAD BODY WAS A PAID ACTOR , he did it for views and for "preventing suicide " idc if he did it for that but i think he did it  for views , but still your acting like stupid
@Bee Queen qwq shut up mouth kid the pauls need a really good beating
wow its even in the news? what a shame?
Taesticles armyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
15 million *followers* on YouTube
Followers? Bruh its subscribers idiot
Logan Paul is fine he said sorry shut your fucking mouth
HE WAS LAUGHING, BECAUSE SOMEBODY HUNG THEMSELVES! HE SHOULD'NT BE POPULAR NO MORE!  WHEN HE LAUGHS AT SOMEONE THAT HAS TAKEN THEIR OWN LIFE! NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT PERSON WAS GOING THROUGH, OR WHAT WAS RUNNING THROUGH THEIR HEAD AT THE TIME! LOGAN PAUL, YOU REALLY MAKE ME SICK! WOULD YOU BE LAUGHING IF IT WAS ONE OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS??? TO TOP IT ALL OFF, YOU TRIED TO SAVE YOURSELF BY SAYING YOU WAS GONNA MAKE THAT ABOUT SUICIDE AWARENESS, BUT YOU WAS LAUGHING ABOUT IT DUDE!!! YOUR SO RUDE AND SICKENING!!! I HOPE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR FOLLOWERS!!!! YOU DON'T DESERVE THEM!!!!  LAUGHING AT SOMEONE THAT COMMITTED SUICIDE! GROW UP!!!
Goes to click the bar at the bottom thinking its an ad. XD I'm dying

Joseph Feigenbutz who would not care youatube is the best
Joseph Feigenbutz still they know nothing about YouTube
he's a total idiot...insensitive...gud job youtube for getting rid of him
Logan Paul didn't make a mistake.
His dad did when he didn't put on protection.
Oh damn lol
there's a difference between followers and subscribers
"I didn't do it for views. I get the views. because i thought  could make a ripple in the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity. I  intend to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention"
talks to a friend: "well, have you never stand next to a dead guy"
                     guy: no.
Logan Paul: *laugh*
me: >:'(
See that made the situation worse. Trying to play off an apology by not actually apologizing but making up an excuse to validate wrong actions.. oh Logan. Logan Logan Logan .
Failed attempt to save his shitty ass. Guy should've been forgotten and lost in history, never to be mentioned again.
#loganpaul4life
Do not cry do not say goodbye put down the knife I promise Im on your side I swear you will win this fight *never ever commit sucide
Jake paul is better
Logan what if you die and evry one luaghs at you
Tsk.I cant believe he did that what a jerk and here I thought he was a cool person.Even this is a really late reply.Hey logan paul you maybe famous and everything but being disrespectful is something you should not be proud or fame of.What will your subscribers think of you know?Those who admired you.I feel sorry for those who actually looked up to you.

Oh my god Logan I thought you were kid friendly but no!
I didn't do it for views I do it for money and popularity
Dang it logan i liked you but now i dont THX!
Btw im not a longang anymore im a jake pauer now
Another YouTuber thought they found a dead body in a abandoned church, but it was actually a mannequin
All 12k dislikes are from his subs
The real question is: how he and his friends escaped Suicide Forest without one suicide.
Ya good for you stupid
"15 million followers in youtube" don't you mean subscribers. But this is so fucked um why the hell would you even post a fucking picture of a dead person who hanged themself. Also,  he needs to cry himself a river,  build a bridge and get over it. Maybe he could actually get a job instead of making crappy videos with clickbait titles and him dressed in a dumb pokemon onesie.
I dont fucking care at least he apologized jake Paul doesnt apologize for anything he didnt even apologize for abusing the Martinez twins
Hey all...let's all unsubscribe and stop giving him views until he's a ordinary unpopular person .let's teach this tosser a life lesson. Lesson One jakey1. Never ever show a real dead person on any videos or photos where peple will see it.2. y? Cos it will make peple commit suicide more.so let's hang this bait bettling bonker out to dry and see that he loses his career on YouTube and so he can't be taken seriously by the public.hes a rich prick who mocked the dead person and put suicide into a whole new perspective.letz make sure his career is over .He does not deserve to earn so much money.
This guy is a piece of shit, thats an all time low for YouTube, UNSUB FROM HIM NOW HES A IDIOT BEYOND BELIEF
And this is what this bullshit world has come to.
Fukien pauls
Internet Forgives Donald trump
Can't forgive a YouTuber.
LOGAN PAUL SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!
He made a stupid mistake and now he has to pay for it
Logan! Why the frick did you laugh at something like that!? You deserve to be demonitises after what you did!
Subscribers not followers you dumb bitch and I feel like hanging myself
Logan is disrespectful and doesn't deserve that many subscribers. He is utterly disgusting and sick!
This guy is fucked up
*M   O   N   I   T   I   Z   E   D*
He didn't show a dead body he saw a dead body I watched it
He gained 80,000 subscribers from this crap
Ans no one aont going to subscribe for that okay and he said, "sorry he didnt did that for views.i get views", or what ever sooooooo stcu...XD
Stfu news like i will still like hin he still my brooo like broo just stop dude
So you're basically kill your whole family, record them and dab on them like Logan. Wow that's brutal.
Logan Paul, what a controversal character he is. Logan does these stupidest things and he needs to stop with it. This video right here is the prime example of why he should not be able to influence people. Like the news caster said " You may not know your kids are watching this guy." Like in the Pokemon costume he was walking down the streets of Japan and just mocking the culture that Japan holds so high. How is one going to come into a foreign country and act like that? I am baffled at the audacity of this kid, I would call him a man but... his acts do not hold true to that. If the mocking of the culture was not enough, look at him in the suicide woods.  "We found a dead body", how are you going to make someones death click bait, hold some respect to the man that died. I agree with all the back lash he got, he is trash for what he did. Then to laugh at the fact they just saw a dead body, a body that someone took their own life, clearly they were down in the dumps then you find humor out of that? That is crazy I hope karma comes back and bites him in the ass. His response to all of it was a bunch of B.S, he thought it was hilarious because he is a child with no adult like tendencies, as he makes Youtube videos of things like this. This guy needs to get a life and not one like this. This kid angers me as you can tell.
he's done nothing wrong it's not his fault that he went into a forrest and found a dead body
I know it was pretty stupid but everyone makes a mistake like if you agree
I hope this Logan douchebag will be forever haunted by ghosts. He is so irresponsible, ignorant and so full of himself.
Nobody should ever make a TRIVIA-ish presentation of a very depressing place.
Who gives a fuck not his fault the person hang him self for someone to see
You don't fuck with the Logan bitch
Logan fuck u and i liked your chanles but u dont do this shit like its messed up now your stupid all the people that like him hate him like this messed shit like who would post that on youtube your so stupid
Your always talk's about people mistakes you better check yours before idiot
Joseph Feigenbutz  the adultes like u distroying the world and u know that and by the way i'm not just a kid like u  say  
Logan poul is a hero we got a hero and ij a hero be aude ij found ones a dog fitting voor death ij dit the at her dog away so
This is fake guys
Followers...... I think its called subscribers
Shooting happened 'cuz of letting all these retarded fucks becoming non sense millionaire.
Go eat shit YouTube :)
I forgive him
aww man I didn't get to watch it :C
Subscribers, not followers.
Shut up bitch
Logan Paul is so mean he just lost a subscriber
it was funny to everyone on his video because they was thinking we not going to see a dead body
it was funny to everyone on his video because they was thinking we not going to see a dead body
it was funny to everyone on his video because they was thinking we not going to see a dead body
it was funny to everyone on his video because they was thinking we not going to see a dead body
"Suicide isn't a joke." so why would you film it?!
No he is 23
Whats wrong is ABC NEWS doing a story on this makin $ off their 10 mil views.
Fuck him he is so annoying band him
I'm 12 and I don g like him
Why can logan's face fit 10 alphabets
I'm a Jack Pauler
Boooooooooooooooooo Logan
That's fake news
It's sick. 
He even now has 17 million. Sickening. I won't be satisfied until his channel is taken down.
Unfortunately, he's too big for YouTube to delete his channel and he makes them lots of money.
I don't like you Logan respect these guys p.s get a life
Oh, somebody committed suicide in the SUICIDE FOREST?
OH I KNOW! LET'S TELL THE POLICE SOMETHING THEY ALREADY KNOW
Another Person From Norfolk Then again maybe the family didnt know and thought this person was missing.
OMG I heard about it when it happen I feel sorry for Jake Greg and Pam they should be mad no one should do that. All the kids that watch Logan something was wrong in his mind cause that is bad for kids. I only watch Jake Paul Jake Paul for life.
Screw yo news.stop
WHAT THE HECK LOGEN
if you know the way logan pail is, why would you expect him to act more seriously about this issue. And lets talk about these celebrity viewpoints, these celebrities are only famous because they pretended to be made up ppl, that doesnt give them an above averaged moral compass and it doesnt make them role models.
0:34 He has 15 million followers on YouTube.
Me: not anymore...
byJAPAN
WOW...I bet people in their mind be like...
*should I go to Jake Pauls channel*
Me: What about 
*Logan Paul?*
Fck hes an idiot
sucks
I like Jake Paul his brother Logan sicks
Fuck u Logan paul
Moronic fuck.
Send him to a prison in Siberia.
I saw the video when it was uploaded like 3 minutes ago I watched it all It was so disturbing espacilly when he went very close to it filmed the leg and fingers if it and the body he showed the bag of the victim Logan is a  absolute tash
I think people are hating on you far too much. I don't think such hate is fully deserved. However. You went about this video the wrong way bro. Seeing you react with enthusiasm  to such a tragedy was disturbing at best.  But i still don't blame you entirely. I truly believe you are a great guy at heart, that simply got caught up in a situation you didn't know how to handle.  How could you know how to handle it? You aren't a cop. You aren't an EMT. You aren't a fireman. You aren't a news reporter. You are not military.  Do you see where I am going?  You haven't been trained to handle this type of situation. At your age...all the little wires that make up our adult brains haven't even been fully connected yet. You are a very young man that is getting hate which is undeserved.  You are not a bad person because of this. Ya just fucked up. I challenge anybody behind a keyboard to say they haven't fucked up big time....at least once.
Ya know what ABC shush. What he did wasnt okay but your just banking on the problem for money so shush
ARE YOU KIDDING ME YOU ARE WORSE THAN YOUR BROTHER!!!!!!  You knew what you were doing you messes up I don't think any one will wach you or your brother WHY WHY WHY would you do some thing that stupid not only your brother bullying the twins and now this I hope your parents are proud 
Arrest him he says bad words to
Yeah he's popular and he is an IDIOT, FOOLISH and IGNORANT.
To raise awareness? Pshh nope
Logan thats so mess up  you know thats  bad
His neck is thicker than his skull
this all happened a day before my birthday?
"I did it because I thought i could make a  positive ripple" 
Year laughing at a suicide definitely brings peace and joy to earth. 
Congrats my friend
@Artyom Bezmenov get a ticket to the psych ward
@Alden Delgado that was unnecessary
Chris, don't you think that's a little too harsh to be describing his family?
Artyom Bezmenov I get it, if someone killed you and your shitty family then thered be less evil in the world
@Artyom Bezmenov Wow, can't believe we have to share the same air we breath with you. Oh, btw I'd like to see things from your point of view, but sadly I can't look that far up my ass.
You are f***ING d*m he did not laugh
"You may not know your kid is watching Logan Paul"
Uhh.. I don't have a kid, and I hate him but my crush likes his songs.
And somehow people belive 
Logans lies
logan pal is mean
the dickhead re-uploaded it
He is fucked up. Not only did he RECORD A DEAD BODY BUT HE WAS WEARING THAT FUCKING STUPID ASS HAT AND FUCKING DISRESPECTED THE FAMILY OF THAT GUY AND HE COMPLETELY DISRESPECTED JAPAN BY FUCKING DOING ALL THAT OTHER DUMB SHIT. HE SHOULD BURN IN HELL Also dont forget all of the ten year olds who now think that suicide isnt a big deal and think it is a joke and think that disrespecting a WHOLE bunch of people is okay and funny... Thanks Logan. Edit: Also, he put #logang4life at the end of his apology tweet... Yeah.... Smart...
ever since I told my friend I was suicidal she kept saying "You don't wanna end up in a logan paul video!" and I was like " true"
I had never liked Logan or Jake Paul and I never will because of this... its making me think he PROMOTES SUICIDE
I''M JAPANESE. I HATE AMERICAN. AMERICANS ARE FAT NOISY DISRESPECTFUL RUDE SELFISH GREEDY WITH MONEY FEMINAZI'S FAT WOMAN A LOT. PLEASE DON'T COME TO JAPANE.
12 dislikes are from the logang
Scumbag. Kick this idiot off Youtube.
He got the same Pikachu alfit as me
AND HES DUMB AND STUPID FOR POSTING THAT VIDEO
I thought Jake Paul was the dumb one
Logan idiiot
When I was young none of us would have watched or "followed" idiotic videos like that stuff anyway and I haven't even reached 30 yet.
...fifteen million followers on YouTube...
Please tell me you mean subscribers
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH LOGAN PAUL!!!!!
Life With Aysheh his apology was incredibly insincere. Plus, I doubt he is really sorry, especially since he's acting like nothing happened
Jerr S he apologize
Life With Aysheh if anyone is rude, it's Logan. I'm just speaking the truth. I honestly don't get how you can still watch him after the suicide forest video, it was repulsive.
Jerr S rude
Life With Aysheh it must be tough to be living without a brain
those people wanted to keep it a secret hats why it's in a forest!!!
Logan: I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention...
Me: Dont make me laugh.
Just fog
dumb shit
Bad move, logan..u have a lot of teen kids who watch u..please watch what u post..my 12 granddaughter loves watching u and yours, and god forbid she would have seen that, she would have thought its ok, and it is  ot.assisted or not..god bless u Logan, and honey please keep up ur good and blessed topics, your an amazing kid in my child's eyes..im praying for u honey god be with u, before u post...ty sweetie..
I am so shocked that he posted the video on my birthday (January 2)
Who the hell is Logan Paul? Lol
His written apology was really narcissistic and stupid. He sounded like he was on a power trip. It wasn't a "monsoon of negativity" we weren't being "negative" we were showing concern and expressing that there was disrespect.
He has fifteen million *followers* on YouTube
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT YOUTUBE IS?!
hypocrisy alert, what about when news channels show dead children as a result of war in the middle east.
I'm still one of his loyal followers
Logan Paul
Jake Paul?
1:31 Aaron Paul has a point thought the way she said it was a little too far, though everyone makes mistakes you can't rely blame the guy
SUBSCRIBERS
Also Logan Paul was laughing they found the dead body
Guys he did not do it on purpose
Gaming Nerds pretty sure he did. He knew what he was getting into
The media needs to kill its self
How can u get followers in youtube? Can someone please explain it to me im just an 11 years old kid....
I saw the video
There's an edgy looking kid at my school who was angry at me for trash-talking Logan Paul with my classmates.
Why the hell he did you this
He's a Dick I know
Hes pig shit.
He is disrespectful and autistic
Your commend is disrespectful. Don't blame autism for this behavior. I'm autistic and I know better.
Logan paul is an idiot
Hey leave Jake Paul alone he's the best yeeeet
Logan Paul: Films and mocks body in Suicide Forest and still ends up with 16 million subscribers

Fk Logan
When Logan's fans find Japanese comment ,they always use ugly words.A group of racist
This guy sickens me like wth?! Leave them be why do you think people say rest in PEACE? God
Both Paul's are fucking stupid
#fuckthepauls
I actually want him to go to jail
If he was a muslim they would be speaking about his religion!
His car is $300,000
i didnt know they were both useless and deserve to be tooken off of the media
Shut up he did nothing the news makes up fake lies
Priscilla Esqueda he filmed a dead body
ABC news  you are so f- up
Logan Paul is so stupid
I saw this when I woke up in January like 9th
You shouldn't have done that because you could of went to jail
Oh my GOD
Leave him alone he said sorry.
He's not sorry for the right reasons though.
Logan is so stupid
Horacio Delgadillo it was fake
Dear Haters
STOP F#%KIN DEFENDING YOUR SELVES 
ITS JUST DEAD PEOPLE
IF YOU HATE HIM
DONT BOTHER TO JOIN IN THE FREAKIN PROBLEM
YOUR JUST MAKING IT WORSE
JLog Lore Fuck off you Retarded Disgraceful human Being
Your such a pervert
I bet your watching a lot of bad things
Idiottttt
I dont know what to do anymore.
oh shit
I saw the video thinking it was clickbait
Well abc can die
He did do this for views I know 
He should aPAULagize again
Logan Paul curses......
So many hates of Logan Paul, whats the big deal people die everyday my 7 year old sister knows about these stuff. This is reality and logan was just showing it. Some people just live in a fantasy saying dont show this and that, when it shows every day on the TV news
I am gonna be honest. Logan didn't mean to find a dead guy. You are all hating on him for filming a dead guy, yet there s people who make holocaust jokes but do they get hate? No. So fuck off.
sounds to me like a typical narcissist looking for attention....it was just a stupid act, of the type these people do to look good on their friends. ......
Total Jackass
Why do people even care haha
Because its wrong and very very disrespectful
The Almighty Loaf exactly , why do people even care...
DatGraphics because he filmed a dead body
I don't get it... you are all watching this guy, hoping to see some really creepy stuff. What else do you expect to see in the Japanese suicide forest? And now you are accusing him of that??
Ok just cause he did this doesnt mean hes a bad guy. Yes he fucked up but that doesn't mean he deserves to die or have no subs. Honestly. I dont know what people have turned into today but its getting worse
He did do it for wiews
Shut up 
Why did he uploaded that video
Gian Lagbas because he is stupid
You suck
Oh no Logan pal
fuck him. An apology isn't going to help anything you fucking bitch
My mom knows Im watching but doesnt care
logan that is not a joke doing that is rely serious because there are people that cate about you
Oh hhhhhhhh hhhhhh it's fake body
loGANG for life !!!!
Michael Becerra 
I don't see anything wrong with what he done. The issue shoild be what the hell is going on in japan where they have a suicide forest. We should thank him for posting the truth of a strange nation's  position on suicide not his position.
You are so stupid. He FILMED A DEAD BODY. WHAT IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND? LOGAN PAUL IS AN 
There has been dead bodies found before on Utube but they did't react or act like he did .But it just be how he was processing what just hap.
It's subscribers!!!!
He got what he deserved
I hate Jake Paul. U can dis me all you want but I don't care. He's horrid.
Puss in Jordans yeah but he is doing illegal things watch film theorys video on him
Its Logan
Not to be rude,but this was about Logan Paul but they both suck anyways
Youre right my friend
PREACH
next video: i found a dead body at a funeral
When u fine a way to make views in a video
sounds legit
2.9k like:)
Obviously
So he went into a suicide forest, THE famous suicide forest in Japan, where a horror movie was also based starring Natalie Dormer. Paul is damn lucky to be alive from that
YOU IDIOTS WHY THE FREAK DO HAVE TO FREAKING HATE DUMBYS AND IDIOTS
I saw the video he posted... dead body and all...
@Galaxy Wolf  
COOL!!
why would he do that?
He has 16 million subs not 15 get it right

Full video here. Fuck logang cult faggits. Gonna upload this video non stop on YouTube. Get at me
Easy to apologize but it hurts then IT REALLY HURTS, what he did is totally disgust and disrespectful Japanese culture and life even in any nations. Don't FUCK around bro!  Try to go to somewhere in Middle East and do your stupid vlog like you did in Japan, mostly likely we're all will find you on the news beheaded and died. DONT FUCK AROUND!!
I am I'm a huge fan but I forgive him every one should have a second chance
He does deserve a second chance but he still needs some consequences behind his actions or he won't learn.
The uniaverse is mine Hernandez no no no
15 million *followers*
Fuck Logan Paul
Logan Paul you are so cruel why would you do that this is why your brother is my favorite!

OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lady: FOLLOWERS on YouTube me: what the wait wha
well i am not a fan of Logan Paul anyways
I dont think Logan should have done that. but he did take the video down and very deeply apoligize for it. and yes i do believe that was his BIGGEST MASTAKE but i will stick with the logang from here on out. #loveulogan #logang #beamavrick
They never seen the real video. He was very shocked and scared, not in any way positive.
dont hate on logan  he did one mistake ok let it slide he didn't know he was going to film this ok let it slide logan is ok he just made a mistake

I do not like Logan Paul he is not a good influence on my lilttle cousin he isn't a good influence on any child I'm ten and still don't watch it
dr. jay they're not retarded. They're 10 years old.
Meatballser yup they are.
You are a good cousin.
Hood Koops kids are going to watch him anyway
Stupid  logan paul
Why do they always say allegedly even tho it clearly did happen
  suck my balls Logan Paul 
"He has 15 million followers on YouTube."
Bruh.
It is not his fault that he found a dead body. He is the one that didn't know there was actually going to be a dead body, well he might of knew that there was a body, but he didn't know he was going to find one. He deserves the love and R.I.P the dead body ;c
atpanlilio dude, he went to a spot where people actually goes to kill them selves and of course something is going to happen, Logan knew what was about to happen you dumb fuck head.
atpanlilio it's called SUICIDE forest what did he expect!?
atpanlilio bitch if you dont stfu imma slap your stupid ass upside down bitch nigga
Ah yes, coming into a forest known for being a place where people in utter distress and depression come to take their final breath. No way a body could have been found there.
If you walk into a place called suicide forest, youre either there to commit suicide, or see the evidence of someone who committed suicide. People dont go into that forest just for hiking and picnics. So, yeah..... its all on him.
NO NO NO PLZ DON'T HATE ME EVEN THOUGH I ABUSE KIDS FOR MONEY AND USED A CORPSE FOR VEIWS NO NO NO
They said 'followers on youtube" instead of subscribers on youtube.
Why is this jackass on tv and not us >:(
He's a adult stupid
Hammerschlgen M that was my brother he gets on my account and does stuff on games and YouTube
@Clasher Bro  
Read your comment and think about which one of you is the stupid adult...errr I meant the "adult stupid".
At least this ain't fake news.
Dude killed him self he deserves to be shamed.suicides are blasphemous.he's in hell now
Velvet Elvis you look like a scuffed rick moranis
This is why, I don't like/watch Logan Paul's videos.
Jesus let me get the bleach
Not only is he embarrassing himself , he is also ruining the reputation of his parents
Send that piece of shit to North Korea !
i feel so bad for logan well he made a very bad choice though
Kyndell Goodman dont feel bad for logan
He so fucking full of himself and he does give one shit about anyone else
I would honestly not even give a shit if his channel was terminated
Just disgusting
Shut the fuck up
Well no wonder it's called suicide forest
wolfdrake Actually, they don't call it suicide forest in Japan. They just the forest's name.
Its not even a big deal THAT FOO TOOK HIS LIFE , THATS HIS SHIT !!
Must See
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMjCY-urxvg
Logan went to the forest knowing that there could possibly be someone dead in there and once he finds the body he keeps filming. He can fuck off and so can social media its turned people into brain dead zombies.
I watched the video, and Logan Paul seemed had good intentions concerning letting people know Suicide is not the answer. However, the way is was taught was not the best.  Americans must understand that what others consider sacred or of great delicate matter, should be respected
I don't like  him
 omfg...
Guys, he's just never been to Japan before. He didn't know what outcome could come out of this. He doesn't know how people do things there. I don't support Logan Paul or jake Paul, but hear me out. He needs a second chance. I know not all of you are christians, but again, hear me out. One of God's rules was to forgive someone, even if they had done something wrong. So... plz forgive him...
HEHEHE IM A FAT KING ummm how about... 
Great way to start 2018 this and the Florida shooting
oscar almaraz *ok ok*
The Almighty Loaf ok ok
The school shooting?
oscar almaraz what Florida shooting
15 millon subscriber s that a lot of white kids
Im not liberal
you know whats dumb af he got even more famous for talking shit about suicide like wtf he shouldn't be famous no more because that's offending especially with mental illness and is depressed and suicidal like me and that cut there self's probably because they so damn depressed
Fire this guy youtube.
@The voyage well he should be sued
You cant get fired cause YouTube dont hire dumb dumb but he can get sued
Wow... some creature here must've sucked some balls REAL hard. * welp*
@UwU Bitch! You support a rat?! Damn, imagine if that was one of your family members! Wouldn't you be upset?! You're probably a spoiled bitch.
Kylie Reagan Yeah ok , its clearly what hes doing he was even LAUGHING at it and your saying He didnt know what to do. Even I forgive that he did the SAME type of shit with the dead, tasing dead rats pathetic. I dont know what is wrong with you supporting a person like he doesnt care about you he just want you to the buy his merch hopefully you see through your foolish ways and open your eyes. Once you do something people are going to talk about it forever especially with that fake apology and evil acts.
He should've yelled ESKITET
15 million followers on YouTube
Did they have a new update again
(Joke)
*cLiCk ThAt FoLlOw BuTtOn*
People are making more terrible videos! There are people who spend 24 hours in stores and thats illegal! Your getting mad at him for spreading awareness! Your so selfish! He just wants people to be happy and live good and just be proud that in life that you have made it is this far!
People spend years to become like a nurse and earn (I don't know but just a guess) 43,000 a year. Now this piece of shit makes a video for views and gets millions, what is our life coming to. I know he said that he was sorry but he is still a little scumbag.
Dont come to Japan forever.
Guys. Stop saying such stuff about logan. He made a mistake, i get it. But guess what. THATS WHAT MAKES US HUMAN. If WE never made mistakes and spread awareness, who would?
My uncle committed suicide you dont understand what it would feel like to lose a loved one so you can shut up kid
Shut the fuck up youre too young to understand
You seriously believe this video was some kind of PSA?? And yes, we all make mistakes. We all have to pay the price for them, too. This is his price, so he and his fandom just have to accept it. Its the same price anyone in entertainment has to pay when they make a mistake in judgement. Hes no different.
Abbii Draws that's like saying its OK and just a mistake if a terrorist came and murdered half a town.
Logan is not, and will not be forgiven. Though I do agree it's his *Biggest* mistake ever.
Followers
If he wanted to raise awareness he should have not uploaded that video but filmed a more serious video addressing the topic instead of discussing it just because of the situations he encountered.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT I HATE YOU LOGAN PAUL
AT LEAST HE SAID SORRY YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO UNSUBSCRIBE JUST BEACUSE A MISTAKE NO YOU GUYS ARE RHE NASTY ONES IF YOU HAVE HIS SHIRT THROW IT AWAY THEN BECAUSE IF YOU DONT LIKE LOGAN PAUL GET TF OUT THIS WORLD
And youtube putting this on number 10 of the trending list at some point. What the fuck is up with that
Eww hes nasty and wierd
I hate him
Ok I hate logen paul but that guy took his own life so kinda his fault logen kinda over reacted but still I don't get the hype not that bad
My uncle committed suicide and this comment is the definition of disrespecting the dead
Youre fucking autistic if you think its the dead guys fault
YOU DONT FILM A DEAD BODY *DO YOU UNDERSTAND*
He's a pussy
My friend said if you turn on subtitles when Logan Paul is apologizeing it says"this is not true he just wants money"
I always hated this guy. His chanel is a big rubbish full of time wasting contents.
@Marcy Perales Then your clearly born with an empty retarded brain.
SHUT UP, HE'S MOR FAMOUS THAN YOU'LL EVER BE!!!!
Me too but, surprisingly he matured up watch his "why 2018 was an important year of my life" I'm shook
Logan and Jake are the best
And I thought Jake Paul was bad...
This chick bout to have said "followers" like this instagram
First of all mind your own damn buissiness ABC news
it ok logan
So dumdum
So this made the news???
I saw the video
Thank God, this is a step towards Logan Paul's death on the internet.
Logan Paul should be banned from YouTube
Logan Paul SUUUUUUUCCCKSSSSSS
"Positive ripple" What the actual F*CK!?
Luka Milic yeah,  literally its so fucked up and there is NOTHING positive about it.
Luka Milic positive for his bank account
The Paul Brothers have made more mistakes than the age of the universe
Wait why is there a suicide forest? I thought suicide is supposed to be prevented or is this Japanese tradition? I really don't know. ...like why are they allowing that? & it's a touring site? I'm confused someone answer please
Ok abc we dont care fuck u
just gonna say that if he did it in a way where he just talked about this without showing any footage people wouldve begged him to upload it
Numerous people have posted dead bodies in suicide forest
American narcissism.
I hope he dies
Who cares if he makes a video like this. If you don't like it don't subscribe to his channel, simple as that. Stop fucking crying that what he did was disgraceful or immoral. That is considered an opinion, no one gives a fuck about your opinions.
Logan is good youtuber
Fuck you
Boo i love logan paul
The videos age-restricted so literally no kids probably saw this
Amecca Jackson Do you actually believe that that is going to stop his kid audience from clicking Im over 18
I dont like him...YALL R PROB GUNNA HATE ME BUTTT
I hope Logan burns.
Don't see what the big deal is dude was already dead anyway who gives a flying fuck in my opinion still shouldn't have posted that shit smh
Shaq Jean OK you clearly don't know the difference between insensitive mockery and dumb shit.
2018 GONIG LIKE CRAZY AN SHOUT AT TO KRYTO9095
HE LOOK LIKE THAT DUDE FROM FROZEN
I HATE THAT CHEESESTICK DUDE
Fuck you logen you suck you are so mest up!
I never watched any of the Pauls originals. My parents put a parental lock saying that I couldnt watch him because they think he is a terrible person
wait wait you foeget moe sargi found a dead body at abonde prison
I am a small YouTube creator and only have 20,000 subs earning only a few dollars per month.  I won't publish bad content just to get views and make money.  I'm happy with my meager income and peace of mind.
Ayano...You sound like an 8 year old who shouldn't be allowed on the internet.
My Philippine Journey pls just stop comparing yourself against other you tubers.  Yes Logan fucked up but you just sound so fake right now.
I honestly didn't know or care who he is
AYYOOOOO GOOD MORNIN LOGANG! WHATS POPPIN!?!?!

I hate you, Jake, and Logan.
F##k you you can see dead people in the news y just when go to hell
Don't stand up for him, what if he filmed your mom's dead body all rotten and pale?!
Those who are suicidal and the Japanese should be against him. Logan Paul disrespectful to Japanese.
guys think again in japanese its normal
Logans' soul is DEFINITELY going to hell.
Can we give him  1 chance
Belle Creswell Nope
I dont think you understand what Logan has done..
Don't hate he just made a mistake we all do get over it people
What I hate is that nobody noticed when he said that he said that he coops by humor. It's like how I cope by drawling
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
It's absolutely disgusting that there's little fuckers here still defending what he did. You people are sick if you think anything in that video was okay. Fucking unbelievable.
Who the fuck pays the moron .... this world is fucked while the rest of us are working hard this cunt gets paid to upload videos of dead people lowest of the low !!!!
What a cunt !!
CONGRATES LOGAN.... U made the fucking news....

Disappointing behavior towards A suicide Victim, it is never funny when a life is lost. I've came across countless individuals with the same attitude, some are even friends I had who are spoiled or experienced family issues. Don't get me wrong, I don't know logan paul personally, it's the behavior he proved that is always familiar. Some never change, some remain. Stupidity is like a disease caught from bad leadership or "IDOLS" and causes immaturity, spreading dumb actions and no sense of respect and honor for others or themselves.. But most of us learn from our wrong, I still have hope for the hopeless and restless. Even though logan was wrong, I hope he learns, and that everybody will leave him at peace.
R.I.P to the late victim.Hitotsu no ai, and condolences to the family.
Fuck you loagen Paul is the most amazing person
Funk you long is the best Youtube
:0 why Logan why
How stupid !!! Hooooowwwww stupid the American view of things is !!!! This idiot is one of the most famous!!!! You guys should just go to hell if u support someone like him. I live in Japan, and I feel SUPER sorry for the very limited American perspective " in general " toward Japan. U guys just see " fun, sick, hilarious, party, cool" this nation should do a lot of work to grow up socially, oh god how I hate this stupid average American perspective
moron
Fckin sensative ass people get over it theres alot of aoki gahara docs that show bodys and remains. Fuckin pussys
I don't watch Logan Paul much
Sick fuck
Welp that person that killed his self is now famous
I'm sry
How disrespectful. It must be so hard for the victims family/friends to watch logan make a mockery out of the victims dead body.
@Lmao Kylie no u

Why do you upload this video do not upload this video
"I'm pretty sure this hasn't happened to anyone on YouTube ever"
Wrong, if you watch TFIL's video of how they went to suicide forest, they clearly saw things. And yes they posted the video but, they didn't show the bodies. And if they did one it's because they didn't see them and two they would blur it out or not even show it in the first place. Btw if you want to see it then go to TFIL and look for the video description of 'OVERNIGHT AT SUICIDE FOREST (warning: incredibly scary)'. That video is 59 min long so you might take a while. And I advise you to watch it in the daytime.
Yeah raise awareness for suicide and stuff while making a joke out of it. It's just contrasting
I dont like logan Paul now fuck him
Scary
Bullshit logan is. He only said that cos his intent didnt take the best of turns and the outcome he wanted which was idk but not to prevent or raise awareness. Dumbass ytuber. Hope his so called success ends in a very fiery way
Why logan i was a maverick
Huh.. I'm...NOT SCARED!!!  Jake Paul shows up, OH GOD NO!
Son of a ass bitches just because he apologized it doesn't mean the family of the suicidee is going to automatically accept the apology since the dead person was broadcasted to the public via the video Logan Paul has posted.
Logan is a pure idiot I agree
I really don't like that guy in the first place.
I LOVE HER GREY SHIRT SO MUCH!!!!!
Who will kill them self to be in Jake Paul video
Nobody
Hydro Hero not me
I am a 17 year old who has had a brush with suicide, I saw the original video, I saw that he was trying to raise awareness even if it was not in the most effective way. The video should have been taken down, However he should not have lost his YouTube page, and parents you should not blame Logan for your inability to keep tabs on what your kids whatch, it is possible with a little effort to monator what your kids watch. Logans video does not offend me, what does is the celebritys and news personalitys and some just normal people acting like they know anything about suicide. If you knew anything about suicide, and had any first hand experience with it you would know it teaches you to be more careful when you use hurtful words, because you dont know what is going on in peoples life, and it could be your comment that pushes them over the edge...and that includes YouTube and social media comments. Take a lesson from this comment I expressed myself and shared my opinion, without telling anyone to go die in a hole or that they are a bad person.
Slurp Juice TF? Why on the earth will someone fake a suicide? You are disgusting
Slurp Juice bitch shut the fuck up 
Well turns out everyone was wrong about Logan. The suicide wasn't even real and the police even admitted to the local press that the whole thing was staged. I put their statements into my playlist if you need to research. So everyone can back off and leave Logan alone. It's not his fault everyone fell for the poorly acted and scripted vlog. It was so fake how is everyone that DUMB
Hammerschlgen M That's funny, i just saw someone's comment on how people should suicide and all who did suicide are weaklings. He/She even argued that the dead guy's family in Jake's video are happy that the guy died...
Im seeing a pattern here.
Hammerschlgen M just leave this person alone. He did nothing.
WHAT THE ACTUAL FREAK
he is so cool
So, you stupid parents let your kids watch Hollywood brainwashing movies about killing and death, but a real dead body offends you?  Pound sand, sickos...  leave Logan alone
JLog Lore Fuckkk off with your non religious, religious, or whatever Shit.  Pound sand, creeper
Veevee Reegnee Jesus forgives you!  I forgive him.
Reuben Hodgins Your so stupid!
You forgive Logan for what he has done??
Yea it be bad but he is trying to make up for it
Hey do you know the whole story no you don't so stop hating on him and he is trying to make up for it so stop hating people and we had no right to judge him haters so stop and you don't know the whole story so you have no right to judge him and your not him so you still have no right.
Sing with me Sing with me Your such an idiot -_-
Its like these little kids dont even care what Logan does!
He doesnt even deserve to be alive
15 millon "followers" on youtube?! gurl this ain't twitter.
People it was a simple mistake you can't just hate on someone we all make mistakes once our lives
I HATE HIK
no need to be a bastard just because logan was hanging around in shady areas
This guy is an idiot.
Why is this dude even famous?!?!?!
This dude is the dumbest douch on the internet and anyone who likes him are dumb too! Quit giving this dude an outlet to film trash! How is he popular at all

IDIOTS!!!!!!!! WHO EVER AGREES TO THIS COMMENT IS SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SMART LIKE ME AND WHO EVER IS READING THE COMMENT AND AGREES TOO THE  COMMENT......READ THE HOLE THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Says the "logang" army who murder person for Logan.
The GamingRose he's not in jail anymore but he did go to jail
Just another viewer he's not in jail
ItzStella Kids he was arrested for it so it is breaking the law
@Isabella Look, you're most likely a little kid. Recording a dead fucking body isn't a simple mistake.
I used to HATE Logan Paul, but this... this changes me and my feelings

LightSolRiver GAMING in what way

LUIS CABRERA Im sorry, but the way you said it didnt sound sarcastic. Maybe if you want to use some sarcasm, make it at least a little obvious.
Fucking sarcasm people
LUIS CABRERA lol u dumbass

LOGAN PAUL SUCKS DICK i fucking hate him (:
Wow wow wow OK bye
The man saw something in the woods, and he filmed what he saw that was there for anyone to see. Im glad he filmed it as it would be an interesting thing to stumble upon In the woods...Suicide is merely a a behavior in reality that occurs sometimes within the realm of human existence...if anything Fuck the dude that committed suicide in a public space...do that shit at home you dickheads
My son is not allowed to watch this idiot
I watched it on Smart TV, I think they didn't remove it...
Is 'under fire' an idiom or is he literally under fire
That xxxx the views on internet gain him lots of revenue, it is impossible to say that he didnt do it for views
This is not the only disrespectful act
Fuan 
DANG THATS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD!!!!!
I however don't care what Logan did he still my favorite YouTuber you idiots
Stop it stop it now he did not know
The world is upside down
Rice gum?
I've always hated Logan pal
*paul
I just can't understand why Google allows Logan Paul to even be on YouTube at all. He must really be still making a whole lot of money for Google. Where are the laws and morals anymore. This would have never been allowed a couple of decades ago. My how the world has changed. What the hell will we be seeing in 10 to 20 years from now? Hope i'm dead by then because my heart can't take this filth anymore!
He did nothing wrong. And you can't be a victim of suicide... You can only be a week dumb fuck who kills them selves and no one should feel sorry for you.
And I was gonna go to china once I was in my 20's, but I don't think China doesn't like Americans anymore.
Make a positive ripple *inhales
*SUPERSONIC BOI*
I I I I was his biggest fan this just ruins it for me that's it am quitting yt no more videos huh  thanks a lot

:( NO LOGANG=NO MERCH
Take this L
Logan KILLED someone wow I Hate him more then than I used to
No Logan Paul is really a brainless person he knew it will cause a big trouble and he just did it. #SoMad
Stop hating on someone you might not even know! (Not to people that didn't hate)
Oooooooooooooooo Logan....
Sorry
Not cool Logan Paul look what you did you took it too much far I don't like you no more boo you
Logan Paul does dum stuff and dont care
I kinda feel bad D:
Logan cies
Logan is good person and he didnt do it for views and we know that too atleast half of people
Yup.  Society is spot on perfect right. So how dare logan paul make a mistake. Start the mistake counter over again from 736,500 days of zero mistakes made by anyone because of, we'll the only mistake since day 1. Get over it people
IS THE LOGANG GETTING SMALLER??
Ok FIRST OF ALL I LIKE LOGAN PAUL VIDEOS But.... I know the video of the forest was dumb but it doesn't mean you can give negative reviews everyone makes mistakes even I do I regret a lot of them and I'm a kid and probably you won't listen to me because you think Kids are dumb and don't review AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE AND I was depressed for 3 years because of bullying and almost committed death but then I thought if I died I couldn't see everyone and everything I loved so when Logan posted sure it was dumb but it was A MISTAKE SO STOP IT YOU ALL HATERS
Seriously your a special kind of stupid aren't ya 
Why cant you just reply to a single comment?
Ohh the children are watching! The children, the children. But the children. Haha.
THis shit is fake or what. This shit is fake. Didn't even see the suicide guy.
There are many documentaries on YouTube about the suicide forest. His video was really no different except for that it was real, in the moment and unscripted. Facing our own mortality makes us feel scared and vulnerable. I think it bothered people so much because it felt as if we were there experiencing this discovery ourselves. There were parts when he acted like an immature jackass, but he and the others were respectful in regards to the deceased. He should stop being slammed so hard by the world and media or he may feel so ostracized as to consider suicide himself.
Why did he do that 
Edgy my fatass what if that was someone you loved hanging and this dumb fuck laughed and cracked jokes and put your love all over YouTube to seeso you can shut the hell up and sit the fuck down
Why do you keep bringing up your fatass? And who the hell was cracking jokes about it? Obviously everyone is upset with it. Hahaha
With so much publicity  Logan got from this video he's probably making tons of money. brilliant guy.
This is just sad this is why i hate him.
Someone offed themselves and he joked who gives a shit lmao
My sister watched it when it wasn't depleted
Uhh.. deleted? Hahaha
Shut up lady he's a Savage Your Average!!!! Shut the f up
Hes not savage, shes not average, and youre sausage.
He said sorry because he's gonna loseeeee alottttttttt of money!
Actually logan paul is disgustingly jerk but his brother is way more than disgustingly jerks

That time of the month? I got something for ya.
I still love Logan Paul

BRUH AARON PAUL YOU GO ROAST THIS LOSER
Aaron paul sucks. So do Logan and Jake. Must be a last name thing.
15 million followers on YouTube. *cringe*
Yes.. a subscriber is a follower. Jesus Christ. Kids shouldnt be allowed to use the internet.
So logan is banned
i can not belivie my fav youtube did that
Thats some bs because if i saw that guy hanging there i would laugh to not because i havd no soul or i think its funn no its because thats the only way i react to anything to calm me down he shouldnt be in trouble or anything if anything rn hes my hero
he only wants attention
He already has it.
hes not intelligent
Well this is an amazing start to 2018 isnt it right 
This whole situation is terrible. That's already been said. But did ABC News seriously just show two television stars' twitter posts as if they are the most important people who have something to say about this matter? Wow, thanks. How else would we know what a self-absorbed piece of shit this guy is without the important feedback of television actors and actresses?
I think I'm not in the logang Amy more
At least he is raising awareness that this is what people go through and this is the real world he is truly trying to make a difference in the world
Hey news fuck you he didn't  mean to show a dead body
Your a jerk
Youre * dumbass. Hahahaha
No no no no no no no logan
Fuck you
At least He Apologized,Just Hop Off Him,I really Dont Understand Whats Going On Cause I Barley Even Hear About Logan
Child fuckers in Hollywood and everywhere else seems to be a problem but no one wants to tackle that one because every mother fucker that you know is going to be outed as a child fucker. I will not live in a world where fucking children is okay. I am okay with suicide. I understand why any good soul would want off of this god damned planet. Man is a despicable, worthless, pathetic, heartless sack of shit with no intention of doing anything good on this planet. This place is a fucking joke.
I really dont know what was wrong with the video. You commit suicide in a very popular place known for suicides and yet we are shocked if someone discovers it and post it. People took it the wrong way. There are videos of worse things on YouTube but this gets people all hyper and offended!!
Its better to leave the body alone
Everyone unsubscribe he Logan paul does not deserve no more subscribers
Hahaha. You tell em.
ABC doesnt know shit! All they do is talk shit
No no,it was an accident! He didn't know how to react! But you are half right. Sadly
What are you doing this again test why tell me why
I HATE LOGAN PAUL AND JAKE PAUL
Type louder please.
hes a creep and his apology was the least honest thing i ever watched.
Guys he did not quit YouTube
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES stop hating on Logan and LOGAN 4 LIFE
I'm not mad that he found a dead body, shit happens
What I'm mad about is that he had the audacity to record, edit, upload and LATER remove it and apologize NOT for the incident, but because he was sick of the backlash, people like him I loathe
I watch him
I wonder how Logans life is going by posting that video of Logan in the suicide forest and all his fans who hate him now
OMG BUT I AM STILL A LOGANGER
I watch the video
I love logan vedeo
I can't believe my friends even watch his videos. He is a horrible person.
I hope that man who committed suicide is in peace. 
That video was unacceptable. 
My friends didn't understand the video. They thought logan committed suicide, but actually he was hiding away from the people who know what he did.
Woah, sorry to break de angry vibe but my dog just came running when i on my Gorillaz CD on
Bullshit mistake my fatass your sorry because you got your ass ripped off and handed to your fucking retarded ass that that woman needs slapped in the damn mouth as well wow just wow you the bitch and everyone else that was laughing should have a bloody ass mouth
Chill out. Quit being edgy.
Yuk omg no Logan u let me down
Pray for Logan and Jake Paul
I will allways for give him
Im scared 
Lol what a fucking Scrub
15 mil followers?!,!?! Uh no lady subscribers
Same thing, dumbass
..followers on YouTube 
What is a subscriber then?
Who the hell is Logan Paul
A dumbass
@Steve Rogers but now everybody knows him negative publicity is still publicity
Glad I'm one of them lucky people. 
He has the fastest growing channel on youtube. And he is one of the most famous  youtubers
It's a robot but not smart robot.
When people forgive him shut up people make mistakes all over the place like you never did shit before shut up just let him be leave him alone
Did she just say 15 million *followers* on youtube!!!?!?!?!?
Yes. A subscriber is a follower. Dumbass
Fuck you im still watching him
Never watched a single video of his in full, and just seeing these clips is giving me whiplash lol
Stop just stop yeah he did a very big mistake but he didn't mean it ok people are like that so just stop
Can people shut up and leave him alone dude stop trying to mess up his life bro you guys suck!
I didn't see the video, but I know what he did was wrong. He should be punished but anyway, everyone deserves a second chance.
this loser should of thought of what he had done.NOT COOL
To make my personal opinion a bit shorter, I'd like to say that killing a monster will only make ourselves a monster in the end. Though I do feel a deep hurt for the man who had taken his life, and only hope to never imagine the pain he had most likely been going through during his last moments of living, I encourage people to forgive. What I don't stand for is the idea that we should forget this whole situation. Logan performed a horrific, inhumane act, but we can't tell him to rot in hell like Aaron Paul did, as that encourages suicide. It doesn't matter how narrsasistic, rude, and prideful someone is, they can still become depressed. Though I do not hate nor support Logan, I would like to forgive. We shouldn't hate, we should educate.
Ma.Concepcion Polvo Melendez lol feel however you want.
PB&J Racing im disgusted
Parvin Chowdhury FACTS
Doctor Hyena lol i still hate Logan...
Parvin Chowdhury you speak words of wisdom. Kudos to you. :P

You're fucking delusional retarded. Hope you die of cancer and Logan will be there for you and record you.
16m now
Does anyone here know the age, gender, next of kin or cause of death of the deceased. Or in any way does this effect your life in any way.
U guys  need to stop  logan paul is better  than  u   ok  that  was logan   dream  to be a YouTuber u guys  should  not just  take  it away  from  him would  u like it if u got  your  dream  was ruin NO you wouldn't like it  so don't  do it to him ok logan  paul  is a smart  man  and he makes awesome videos  and he is really  really really really  funny   so u guys  need to stop talking  about  logan paul   he did not mean to  do what  he did  so stop talking about logan   you now  you hurt logan paul  you messed up his dreams ILOVE LANGAN and everybody will do what it takes to let Logan Paul post videos
You're funny. No any full stop whatsoever. Are you blind? Logan literally make jokes next to dead body and you didn't care? Wow. Hope you're not dab on your grandma's funeral.
if hes better than me then why dont i laugh at dead people
I think I'll just leave the both sides fighting now I want it to be a good 2018 
Thats what he gets >:)
More attention. Thats what he got.
Since when did the US become such a sensitive, pussy ass country?
Just when I thought jake Paul was the stupid one
Milkandjungkookies right
Ya Fookin Losah yes
Nichole Korth fuck u kid
I really hate people who only says "armyyyy!!" Where there is no bts relate to what the person said, except for the profile. Ugh it's obvious he/she is an army, is it necessary to mention it? Or just wanted attention cause that person whoo said "armmyy" is an army(bandwagon)? Mm
Milkandjungkookies - YES OMG TRUE
No way I'm sub or like
Idiots Logan is funny I bet he is still going to heaven
Mesut Bekta - heaven nor hell exists.

fuck logan paul,  He exposed what suicide is to millions of kids, my younger cousin 10 years old is a big follower, he  tried to hang him self yesterday because his friends got mad at him in school. LET ME GUESS WHERE HE GOT THAT IDEA FROM?
Sut up
Logan you dumbass idiot in would still me loganpaulers if you didn't post the video you ugly fatass
His explanation is gross!!!!
these motherfuckers influence our children, fuck this guy
Mans is hot check the statistics his fault higher than yours proof if you check the statistics i know people make mistakes but he fucking filmed a dead body just think if it was a family member of your's!
Logan Didnt mean it I still love Logan he is still my favorite YouTuber no matter what
0:35 lol she said followers.
He is NOT fird he posted a vedio on wensday
IT WAS SPELLED WRONG ON PURPOSE DUMBASSES GFKYS
Mikayla Bennett THEY SPELLED IT WRONG ON PURPOSE DUMBASS GET IT RIGHT GKYS
Luna Love good GKYS
June Moon lmao isnt u like 7
June Moon firstly retake your spelling test and second,  his whole channel should be taken down and then he can actually get a job that doesn't involve making vids with a trashy clickbait title.
Shows how much the dead person thought of the people that would find him.  One thing is for sure this young man Paul Logan and those who were with him will never forget that imagine. They may need therapy. No one thinks of them.
Well from what I have seen this guy Logan Paul was not joking about the body and he literally went into shock during this video. He's only 22 and shouldn't have his life destroyed over it.  I am sure someone will make a documentary on this suicide forest and it will be on t.v. sometime soon. It is a wake up call to the world as to what happens in other part of the world.
15 million followers
Yes, He has 15 million followers.
He didn't do it to "raise awareness of suicide." He did it to increase prifit fir himself by getting views from gullible children and adolescents. The apology was a farce to smudge over the matter in the hope YouTube would still pay him for the clicks on the video.
Everybody makes mistakes
When someone finds a dead body and finds it comical while loading up pics of the dead body on youtube, for money. Wow, just wow! Must be hard on his parents seeing their son do something so eerie.
He is just such an idiot!!!! His apology is just him trying to fix his image!!!
He just didn't know how to react
Suicide???
I go watch the video
Logan Paul video no click bait hd : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHakZtoYwjM&feature=youtu.be
Thanks me later!
I was never a fan of logan but thats a fucked up move u say u want to spread awareness about suicide but yet still you were laughing and all that shit like bruh really
I dont look at tha fgt
his apology is JUST TO SAVE HIS ASS.
I don't watch logan paul
Other channels make videos about cannibalism why arnt they getting a negative effect?
*Cough couch* logan and jake paul
Lord Goat get tf outta here with that Spiderman shit. LMAO "with great power comes great responsibility".
+E-CLIPSE ikr,  yet they age remove all adds for supermario Logan. Smh.
Because then video that are ACTUALLY raising awareness, unlike Logan's video would get a negative effect.
Ivette Galan look at you! Calling me stupid. Correcting my spelling 3 days ago. I'll just let you take the time to stare at your comment and look at the abomination you have created.
Edit: The spelling is not the only issue btw.
Hes a tool! always has been

This is why I don't watch Jake or Logan Paul.
I hated Logan Paul and Jake Paul but unfortunately forgave Jake Paul because he's the one who took the video down and Logan Paul... Let me tell you you won't believe me and I bet that's true but I'm suicidal and this just makes me mad with this.
I am happy that I at least saw the vid before it got taken down.

will you forgive him video https://youtu.be/Py_cTEdcoxk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bzujQfqE0
He stopped making vids too
Just made fun of something so terrible. He acted like a fool at the expense of those that must have suffered to resort to suicide. The parents, relatives and friends that also suffer when someone takes their life.  He went into an area where suicide is common and he dressed like a fool and when he came upon a victim, he still acted like a fool. Now he says he was trying to bring awareness to the subject of suicide--PURE BS. He continued to act like a fool after the authorities arrived. This suicide was a tragedy and this fool made light over this shocking and troubling act. Logan Paul, go away.
this means there is 15 million fucking idiots out there
I need link. I coundnt find in youtube

#logang
Killed him with his cringe
Logan Paul probly killed him lol
Pretty scary that so many young and impressionable kids watch him and want to model their own lives after his. What he did was WRONG. those of you defending Him do realize that he filmed an actual DEAD BODY, correct? That wasnt just a prop or a cloth dummy. That was an actual person. Someone who had hopes and dreams but felt so lost and unsure that they figured the only way to deal with their pain was Suicide. This is NOT a joke. Put yourself in the shoes of the family of this person he filmed. Think about how you would feel if you happened to see a video of some dumbass in a toy story hat goofing off and having fun while your loved one dangled from a tree above him. Think about how youd feel knowing some rich and conceited shithead posted a video of your dead family member dangling from a tree, so he could get views and gain attention. Because thats exactly why he did this. It wasnt an accident or a mistake. He intentionally made this video and posted it, knowing the consequences of his actions and not giving a shit. Hes only apologizing because he got caught and hes terrified thats he going to lose subscribers/fans. Hes scared stiff because hes losing endorsements/publicity deals. He made this choice of his own free will to do something so shitty. No one forced him to. This is all on him.
Fucking hell.... he's an idiot yet we love him.... I'm still a maverick and always a savage for the Mavericks and are family I'll support him no matter what others say
Boiii
Fuck you
Dejenlo en paz loco

Im unsubscribing Logan paul
15 million followers
Logan deserves to be banned
Wow that's super crazy dead bodies are uncommon
What is wrong with Logan pall
He goota know da wae
This is so sick, especially since about a lot of people commit suicided in my school district.
as much as this breaks my heart, you guys we need to think. Logan has impacted many kids lives. He basically brings the joy out of our children and siblings, etc. We cant just bash him because he has made one mistake. We all make mistakes. We all deserve second chances. I personally always chose Logan over any youtuber because he just has a side that will make you smile all day. Im sorry if anyone feels that my opinion is false or unclear but this is just how i feel. I hope the rest of the world can understand.
HE FOUND A DEAD BODY... SO WHAT? HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH!!!
Omg Logan Paul.... they make a big thing about this ughhh
Forgive and forget
Logen has been a jokester since he was 10 years old from what my son says and trust me when u see a dead person it stuns u for real and him being a jokester his mind could not wrap around what happened so he laft a lil but its not a funny haha its a what the fuck is this for real did i just really come across this man so ya he smirks about it and jokes a lil not meaning to mean and disrespect my sister dos the same shit when faced with something crazy and trust me when i say this I'm no Logan fan i have only seen him on disney with his bro one time but when my son told me about it i watched it and im telling u right now it was not him being an ass hole and ya he should not have filmed it but shit theres people out there filming crazy shit all the time like people beating up people on the street he made a mistake shit we all do I'm very shore he won't be the same after that or for get it he will be scared for life just seeing a dead person can make u do things u would not ever think u would and everyone reacts different when faced with something horrifying
I am crying

I know this is terrible and stuff and it is very wrong but......what do you expect in suicide forest? I agree he shouldn't have done what he did but there isn't much else you would find in a suicide forest
Can Logan paul have a second chanse
Absolutely not!
Gghgh ZzBnbv I think not
Logan Paul needs to quit YouTube
Logan pual sucks
This whole "Logan Paul" controversy so clearly comes off as a fake set up schemery for whatever reasons. Especially with all the major media outlets covering and helping publicize this even more than it already is. And those of us who know, know who truly controls and owns the media. 
YouTube has became a major platform that the presstitues and Jews see fit for use of their propaganda. With the increase of the Internet and the web, TV is becoming less of a thing. And they know that. And when they cannot brainwash the masses with TV anymore, they will use the Internet/YouTube. And that is what they are doing. 
I would suppose that they are doing this to crackdown and censor the freedom of YouTube/web. The video clearly appears staged, bunch of actors smiling, worst of all, the "body" clearly appears fake and stiff, as a dummy. What is scarier is that seemingly 99.9% of the people are gobbling this story up with zero question. I have to remember though that the majority of people still trust their government/media and live inside the legendary symbolic reality called the *matrix*. They are not ready to be unplugged.
kid is a fucking loser, go hang yourself bitch boy
WHY LOGAN PAUL,WHYYYYYYYY??????
Put he didn't know how to feel
You news reporters are soo ignorant
Logan went to far on the video
logan was my favrote youtuber but then he screwed it up now what job is he going to have
Eh you guys realize that he is already set for the rest of his life and with a very expensive lifestyle lol.
WuPiDu 
First of all, just because he was making a lot of money that doesn't make him a celebrity or famous!! I didn't even know who he was before this and neither did other people that I talked to!! Only one out of eight people knew who he was!! When you are a celeb, AT LEAST 9 out of 10 people know who you are by name!! Logan didn't even come close!!
Also not many sane people would want to hire a person with the morals of Satan like Logan!! Mocking dead people just for views is morally repulsive in anyone's book.. well.. except for Logan's!!!!
Samantha Copeland he will probably be your investment banker...then make a youtube video of stealing yours and other peoples money to a country with no extradition 
7Ahilles You're dumb.
pfff booo hooo he didnt do anything, all reac like its him who hanged that guy lol
I actually feel bad for logan
Give him a second chance dang he is a good dude so u try and get 16 mil subs
What's all the fuss about showing a dead body?
STOP TALKING BOUT IT, IF U DONT LIKE IT DONT TALK ABOUT IT GEEZ U GUYS ARE SO DRAMATIC #LOGANGFORLIFE
#Logang  why

Shut the fuck up were not perfect
LOGAN PAUL IS A DISGRACE TO YOUTUBE
FOLLOWERS?!?!?!?!? Its friggin subscribers...

Fuck this guy!!!!! Fucking idiot man!!! can't believe people even give him the time of day why would anyone want to look up to or idolize this clown!!!!
I love logang!
I know this was 2 weeks ago. But seriously Im trying to get away from it. But Dammit Its hard to get away from it. Its getting old about people still talking about it. Especially in school. God the kids are soo annoying in school talking about it. I sometimes just wanna get up a slap them so bad cause its getting super annoying hearing about it.
He diden't know !!!
jhahahah!! ''apparent''
IM THE LOGANG
Milenials Against Logan Paul M.A.L.P.
I am such a fan
One mistake should not define who a person is
Did she just say followers instead of subscribers? lmao
+soul_ punkk idc I just like to reply to anything
Dasha Pacheco What the fuck, I wasnt talking to you 
+soul_ punkk  as a matter of fact you yes. yes i am
Are you retarded or...?
basically the same thing 
Seriously I'm getting tired of ABC News
Logan definatley deserves what he's getting but he does deserve a second chance.We can't stay mad at him forever.he is only human and we should forgive like Jesus Christ forgave us for all the sins we did yes it was wrong but he isn't perfect and yes he really fu#ked up but its not like he murdered anyone.He is young and dumb and his whole life shouldn't be ruined because of one bad choice
Well... um YouTube can take down his videos
Well whether you like it or not he's getting a second chance because he's going to start vloging again on Wednesday and YouTube won't stop him
No he does not and don't mention Christ in this situation it's kind of different
15 mill followers or subs
15 mil followers on utube
Logang paul
i hate lp because he is a bad guy in the story
I do believe he should have stopped recording but everyone makes mistakes i know I've made some really mistakes and I've gotten more than a 2nd chance he deserves one too although he is famous and a lot of ppl look up to him (including me)  he is human like all of us and we all make mistakes so I believe he deserves a 2nd chance but that's just my opinion so plz don't start hating on me cuz it's not gonna change the way I feel about this situation I look up to Logan and will always forgive him NO MATTER WHAT cuz I'm a REAL FAN  I love you Logan and hope you come back soon
No he does not deserve a second chance he crossed the line
Stupid idiot logan paul
Now its on the news 
You are the worst
Fucking fuck it's not his fucking falt u peace of shit people hors ho think logan is a fucking monster no he is a fucking human being give him a fucking brake I mean shit fuck
Didnt watch the *original* video but saw it on my feed
I thought that bitch was doing it and faking for likes
Boy was I wrong
this hole issue is stupid. ppl die everyday, they went to a place that is known for ppl going to die y wuldnt they expect to actually see sumthng. y isn't the place they went to under scrutiny? or the government ther that is openly nd knowingly allowing ppl to go into this forest to die. wake the f up death is apart of life. it happens u shuldnt shame ban or hate sum1 cuz they saw / recorded a dead person. ther dead they don't care.
Never mind
Did they take the video down?
Nevermind
His channel is done I feel sorry for him
Yeah i know he apologized. But still, not a good idea to make a video about it. I wouldn't have even commented on it i would just report it to the authorties. It could be apart of a murder case or something. Personally i think he should get banned for it. It's pretty offensive because i've witnessed death before, from someone close, and if i found out he just took a picture of that person and voiced it on you tube, i'd be pissed i'd file charges. At the very least he might get banned for it. Because that's pretty serious. I hope he learned his lesson though.
HE SAID SORRY HE NEEEDDSS A 2nd CHANGE
De wae
Fuckin pathetic
To me this isn't disturbing.
Suicide boy is now burning in hell.
Rest in fire.
And I thought that 2018 was going to be a good year I guess not...
Logan is losing subs
I hope that if Logan Paul does ever kill himself, we can film his dead body and laugh and make jokes about it. Oh and we'll say that we did it for, "Suicide Prevention", yea that sounds about right.
Yea did it for 'Suicide Prevention'.
Bullshit.
Sienna your right
FUGE ALL OF U WHO DON'T LIKE HIM
well it not that fault and he just want to tea h the logang ales in about not doing anything like thaf
Guys yes Logan did laugh but he feels really guilty but he never meant to cause problems he just a human like everyone else but srsly cant u forgive him for his screw up
this nigga says FOLLOWERS XDD
He's only showing his true colors. He intentionally does things he knows is wrong. With bullshit apologies on hand.
"Oh sorry Post Malone I just didn't know, you didn't want me to show everyone where you live". No you did it on purpose, because you were mad him and Ethan were making fun of you.
"Oh sorry everyone I only accidentally walked up on this dead body, and i only posted it to bring awareness" no you intentionally walked into the suicide forest looking for someone who committed suicide. And then you filmed it, made fun, laughed, and posted it to get views. You're mind must be sick.
To all of you Logan Paul bummers (fans), please read on, but don't hate because I haven't got room for negativity on social networks like YouTube. Anyways, please answer for me the following and for the parts you can't answer, think about them very deeply and be 100% completely and utterly HONEST. Nothing more, nothing less, just honest. Btw, sorry this is so long, I just want to get this through!:
 So your saying that if someone in YOUR family committed suicide and a Youtuber in a suicide forest came across it, intentionally recorded it, never, not ONCE thought about deleting the clip whilst editing or if kids saw it or something similar that you'd accept it and stand up for him?! Wth,how messed up has society become,like why?! Or what if a similar situation happened with Logan where he committed suicide and another Youtuber recorded it for the views to get so-called "better content" you would leave them alone? I get they would be more popular (the Youtuber's, so it was a bad example) but that man may have been popular in his area, industry or time! That video is by no means spreading awareness because not ONCE in the video did he say anything like, "Guys, this is for awareness, spread the message not to bully or tell people to commit suicide" or so on. You need to think before you write. This upset me very deeply and I wasn't even related to the poor man who did the act of suicide.
Thats the way he copes? WIth finding a dead body? Okay so, if he goes to a funeral, he's just gonna make a bunch of jokes and laugh? Thats just outright disrespectful, theres a phrase that you use when someone has died and its called "Rest in Peace" but laughing and saying, "GUYS OMG I JUST FOUND A DEAD BODY, LOOK AT THEIR HANDS!! THIS IS INSANE!!" What the hell?! Theres something called having respect and he clearly doesn't have that.
*I Like Dogs* forest
that's the way he cope's a lot of people cope in different ways and his laughter
Beautiful Beauty Yes, he is a human. But 22 is supposed to be a age to be mature, not act like a jerk 5 year old.  But he made an idiot move. Laughing at suicide isn't a acceptable thing. It's pathetic. Nor is it a mistake.
Logan is such a fake and a liar,I don't know how people get famous for posting videos on YouTube
why would you raise suicide by laughing at it
this was on the news in the UK
Who cares get a life idiot
He's bad
What a DUMBASS 
Idk about you guys comments I still like loganpaul and every one makes mistakes
I think we need to talk about suicide more...not less. When you realize that suicide & overdose are one category, not two you are hit with the reality that suicide will soon be our leading cause of death yet no one wants to talk about it & there is public outrage against anyone who makes an attempt to shine some light & understanding. Shame on Japan for having a suicide forest where people can quietly end their lives without casting shame & bad luck on the people & places they leave behind. The deceased hung alone in the forest. Who are any of you to criticize that the one & only person who sought to understand rather than forget a lost & broken sole. Does looking the other way pretending not to see the ravages of emotional pain & suffering all around you make you that much better than the person who seeks to remember the dead & find wisdom & understanding by connecting with their pain.
fuck you all
BHAHAHAHA TO BAD LOGAN PAUL, SUCKS TO BE YOU BHAHAHAHA
Logan is an idiot for doing that for any reason its disrespectfull
Logan wait no it can't be
Tough shit...someone couldn't cope and offed themselves. It happens every day. Get over it already. People die in horrible ways every minute. Go march or something ..say another prayer or w/e the fuck you brain washed asscracks do to make yourself feel more important in life than you really are.
The internet doesnt forgive
I'M STILL A MAVERICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a very disgusting human. He's very disrespectful and racist.
Back off
Makes no sense if he had the title had the dead body so why did they click on it it was the childs option to click on it
Wow dang leave him alone
He said he was sorry
I hate Logan Paul no he's such a jerk I'm not going to call him ever and never going to give him a thumbs-up I'm going to always give a thumbs down because of what he did is very wrong he should have went for jail too for that
ARE YOU STUPID YOUR THE WORST AND LOGAN IS THE BEST
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo he is LOGAN
I didn't even know suicide or Japan existed. Thank god for the smart people like logan paul.
Hey Logan Paul is a good guy now abc news you need to shut up you copy team 10 and now this and it's not a trend
He's such a dick
i love logan but this is just wrong! WOW
Hes ridiculously stupid for uploading a video featuring the dead body of someone who committed suicide, but they dont point out the fact that he talked about suicide and you should go and get help if youre that bad a situation - he had good intentions, and then when he realised his error, he apologised.
AA610, he said in the video to go get help if you in a bad situation. Anyway, he went in focusing on the haunted aspect of the forest, and wasnt expecting to actually come across a dead body. 
He obviously shouldnt have shown the video, but he has since apologised sincerely, and doesnt deserve so much hate.
Nothing he did in Japan had even remotely good intentions.
Not a good start for the year
Bro leave Logan and learn it's not his fault
Japan is trying to delete his channel
man glad to see the onion is still around   .....oh wait a minute..
I want you to think if you all in this situation and all people is willing to give you 1 more usefull chance
I use to hate logan but after watching this i thing we need to give a chance
Everyone is not perfect can you give him 1 more chance
Was that Juanpa?
All of the triggered kids in the comments are hilarious 
Logan is a disgrace
End of story
Welp,he is famous again.

are u serious go to hell you sick person
Ethan Brady episode stupidddd
NOOOOL LOGAN PAUL!!!
That might be so but the way he laughed was an insecure laugh and was shocked my family does that when we see a dead body last summer I watched my grandmother die slowly and when she died I laughed sadly and felt insecure about becuz it just happened. Also he didn't even make fun of the dead body I watched it and it didn't show any part of him making fun of the dead body
Ok. Now I'm going to be honest. What people say are right. Like many people said. He knowingly posted the video even after it went through his editors and everything. It should have at least come once to his mind that what he is doing is wrong and just straight up messed up. I mean he made the video but after making it he should of seen his mistake and trashed the video. Dude, Logan you really screwed up this time.
SAD PART IS WITH YOU SO CALLED PEOPLE... YOUR STILL MAKING THIS GUY POPULAR!!!   IDIOTS!!!
Adolf Hitler- Im the most hated man on earth

FVWYIUBHAHIUBSIUHSA
I'm sure he only tweeted that to save his arse
Can yall get off everyones ass? He already feels like shit damn.
They made this video so they could get views and ride on his fame he did nothing wrong now stop complaining
Its not reall
All the delusional Logan Paul fans just don't get it. Anyone defending this lowlife that makes fun of suicide needs to be locked up in a straightjacket.
Did you guys hear what Logan Pauls new video is going to be??
*DIGGING* *UP* *A* *DEAD* *BODY*
A rather interesting opinion I have about this. 
Go look up TFIL's video of their visit to the Suicide Forest. They showed the body, but it was so far off in the distance that you could hardly even tell what it was unless you were *looking* to associate the figure in the distance with anything resembling a dead body. They posted a reaction video and even apologized for showing it because they didn't know a second one was spotted after uploading it due to how obscure it was either in real life (though they weren't looking down, they were looking up) or on video. With either dead body shown on camera, there were no distinct details visible enough that it would be immediately known as a dead body. 
Logan Paul filmed it, up close, barely blurred it so that it was still visible just what it was, laughed about it with his friends, and posted half-assed apologies about it in hopes that he could somehow save his career from going up in flames, which it already has. Something good to keep in mind is something Megan McCarthy said: a lot of smaller youtubers are terrified to come out against him because of how big his career is, and that he could easily destroy their careers if they do him wrong in his eyes. 
That's sad.
HE DIDNT MEAN TO LAUGH ITS NOT EVEN COOL HE ISNT LIKE THAT AND PLUS HE ADMITTED IT SO GET YALL SYORY STRAIGHT SO BYE
this is sick I have him now
Lol you guys are not funny at all Logan did not do that Logan he did do that for like you stupid
Why dont you shut the duck up tv reporter no one need you right now so get over the insadent already and forgive and forget I mean come on
Who the fuck cares?
I almost subscribed to you but now im not not cool
This only got veiws bec it has to do with logan
Bullshit he was laughing in the video...
And he only did it because he was forced to
He got a second chance
OK I see why you guys practically hate Logan Paul I know its wrong but people make mistakes and he said he was sorry and I also know that words can't fix things and everyone is shaming him for something that he did its not right I have no hate tords him
Check out this app  https://sweatco.in/hi/jesus789024 ... It pays for walking
#Logang
May he rest in peace but he's in hell for taking he's own life
I'm done they called subs followers
Give Logan a second chance
Why do people still give him the time of the day??? Stop talking about him, delete him, forget him.. he thrives on this attention! Disgusting human being, he needs to disappear from the social media altogether..
It doesn't matter 5 other you tubers went there leave Logan paul alone ok
OMFG THIS IS ACTUALLY ANNOYING CAN EVERYONE SHUT UP ABOUT LOGAN GOD HE IS A YOUTUBER AND HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR VEIWS BUT NOT THIS SO SHUT UP BECAUSE THIS IS ACTUALLY PISSING ME OFF
Everyone flips me up bc I swear to god that they are just doing all this to get veiws and anyway at least he isnt a dwebe like the people that dislike him Jesus
I say logan paul is an idiot and a jerk
Haha funny. He tried to raise awareness for suicide by going to a suicide forest, dressed like a clown wearing a pokemon hat. If he really wanted to raise awareness he could have just shown the body from where he first spotted it without approaching it and then showing the aftermath and confirming his suspicions after he had called the police.
can u guys get me to 10k subs than my dad will stop smoking
I first thought it was clickbait, where there just rope or something, but I never knew there was an actual body, such disrespect to the family when he laughed
He is a f**king idiot
Why can't ppl just get the fuck over it it was just a mistake just get over it
Thank god i hate Logan Paul...WHY DID YOU DISRESPECT MY MOTHER 
YOU FUCKING TURD FUCK YOU LOGAN PAUL..
(I'm from Tokyo :) )
I HATE LOGAN PAUL SM HE IS A BITCH
It is not Logan's falt that he found that body he should get another chance what is wrong he just should a body what is wrong with that I know he should not put it on YouTube but he should get a second chance support logan
I love your vids keep it
What is the name of video
It was so aggravating and annoying to see this guy's YouTube videos in my home feed and didn't understand why he was popular (never wanted to find out why), but I knew he was trouble!
he is just pure evil
Go away Logan Paul. You suck. I do not want my kids to look at you anymore. I think we all should also boycott You Tube too for allowing this to happen
Idiot Just letting you know in case you're looking in the comments for it - the dead body isn't shown at all in this video
Logan pawl is TRASH
That every needs to know is when a not so popular channel post something similar to this or exactly like Logan did most or even all people don't care but,  when a popular person does the news is on it just to paid thats studied because you can go on the internet and find multiple videos over it search and you will see
2018 is starting off strong........and not in a good way
I thought he said 2018 was going to be his year
15 million followers? dont you mean subscribers
this guy Logan paul called have autism and is retarted filming a dead body and posting it on youtube
fuck off
Its not his folt
YouTube *followers*
Now time to rid youtube of Jake Paul
Raise awareness for suicide by laughing at the dead body ?? WTF
Orang mau tenar doang
Yeah let me unsub to that Disgrace Its just that i cant believe he Would do such Disrespect and jokes about something that is serious
Half of the people don't even know the weather so I don't know how you guys want to know the weather and you look like Donald Trump you little white man
You guys are stupid Logan been popular like forever so do not come for him, come for you
All his YouTube YouTube are lit so and half the people don't even watch your channel cuz all you got to do is lie
Lady it's subscribers not followers
are you guys are talking smack but he's a Savage bore Your Average
You guys are dumb and we're over here Deb and on you guys is haters because on Logan he says dab on these haters so shut up
those type of people that will do ANYTHING for money
Wtf would he show this video to young kids
That's so rode Logan paul
Ok I hate this Logan Paul is a nice guy and to be honest ya what he did was wrong but people make mistakes its not like he chose to find the body and ya like I said it was wrong what he did but does everyone really have to hate on him Im pretty sure he realizes what he did was wrong and also I bet half of the people saying shit about Logan are the height school bullys and Logan is the kid that gets made fun of for one mistake i know because all of my middle school and most of my high school years I was bullied to the pint were I had to move schools but it still found me so until you are in the situation he is shut the fuck up
Wtf its on the news XD
Oh my. Who the freak cares? This guys hilarious. He doesn't deserve all of this crap. Go #IStandWithLogan
He is going to get cursed
i miss logan paul
His apologie was bs.
Reality check? what is this dr.Phil
They said followers on YouTube its subscribers on youtube
People acting like they never saw a fckin death body..
Well at least he knows what Forrest to go to when he's had enough with life. Way to go you guys, you guys aren't any better.
I say he just lost.. you know how people could get lost sometimes where they forgot their purposes and who they are just because they're having something? The fame that he have makes him do things out of logical thinking.. I'm not on anybody side here, but I think it's good that this happen, so he'll remember.. things happen for reason..
guys do not be a logangter be a jake paulers
he drives a 250 thousand dollars car....so what ...shes more pissed to the fact that she does not drive a car like his more than the fact of the video content itself
How's this deuce bag? Paul WHO
Who the fawk cares
I love him am his fan
Why care about seeing a dead body, I mean literally people get all freaked out over it but its called the suicide forest for a reason. Also I dont watch logan paul so Im not protecting him or anything like that and all Im saying is that if I were logical I wouldnt care about stuff like that cause it already happened.
Logan was my only entertainment when I was really sad.. and my own PARENTS don't support me?!?!?! I know people hate logan now, and people sill love him, but half of my best friends are in the same situation as me?! Logan made a difference in my life, after that video when he made a video on someone committing suicide. But he also made a difference in my life in how I now act, I used to be VERY shy and only have 2 friends, i swear, thats it! But when I started watching him, I grew into a happy and energetic child, especially when I only had 2 hours of sleep once before school.. :P I'm not defending him, I'm just making a statement on how people can make others change into something better, not all, but Logan did to me and some of my friends now.
Denise don't look up to Logan. Look up to Jesus. The joy is even greater 
Thank god u have some sane parrents
DENISE Riggles youre a lost individual
DENISE Riggles it least there's ONE thing positive thing.
He needs to get  banned from YOUTUBE. 100% only kid's subscribe  And that's why our generation is retarded.
Who care what he did I love him we all make mistakes 
-emma
He can get a second chance
0:16 i thought it was an add in the bottom
"LOGAN *FALL* "
Whodafuk really gives a flying fuck about this Logan Loser??
Ppl just want attention ppl die everyday.  Everyone on this planet lives a happy little life off of deaths of millions.  Hate how ppl take death so seriously you ain't stopping ur death so man up
Forgive Logan is paul
damn Logan
he does not want this shit you guys are giving him
Apparent suicide? Excuse me, it was an actual person who committed suicide. It is not an apparent suicide! This is very disrespectful to not only the person who died, but to everyone else! He is a horrible person and I hope he is banned from YouTube.
I think what Logan Paul did wasn't right but people making a big deal about just because they can throw somebody under the bus.But people should't criticize him and want to kill him because what do you think Logan feels like right now. People commit suicide because people are hating on them and wanting to kill them. So i think Logan is handling this good because most people who is going threw what he has would actually commit suicide. So Logan knows what he did is wrong but all of people and the famous people don't need to make him feel bad and make more people hate him
no one should be hating on him cuz only his two other friends where laughing so get so listen up
I am having second thoughts about u nsubscribeing from Logan Paul. He apologized he's just a 22 year old kid that makes stupid mistakes
Logan is so mean and I thought he was cooland am 11
I know Logan did do a very wrong thing. But the good thing is he apologized. I love Logan's videos. He didn't know what to do. As a good fan I forgive him.
Gem Phosphophyllite I'm sorry  you are NOT my mother and I can do what I want. Also why are you picking on a 13 year old? I'm guessing you are a adult that is trying to get in little kid's minds.
Chavvy :D well you can think that but I forgive him so bye
kid you should stop watching youtube and drink your mamna's milk
what he did is unforgivable
I can't wait for this dumbass Logan to get banned, I will be feeding off the misery of his worshippers once that day arrives... 
i hope u know your do the exact same thing as logan paul u showed the dead body and I think the poice and any other person should have closed the whole forest its called the name for a purpose so its not logan fault and if it is then it mine too.
I don't care if Logan Paul is going to jail I'm still going to like his videos
Where are the logangsters!?
Everybody makes mistakes
Logan Paul needs to have 2 chance!!
How the fuck is this the way you react?
The thing I dont get is that he didnt actually show the body up close soooo
Yeah Agree with them lol Im one
he din mean o do that
He's bad
"Game of Thrones star, Sophie Turning calling him an idiot."
Everyone's an idiot in their own way, but Logan pual's one of the biggest idiot ever, even a bigger idiot than me to say the least.
*F0ll0weRs*
*i will rather choose jake paul the crazy stupid man*
Stop complaining about something that he had no control over!! Y'all act like he killed the guy himself and people make documentaries about that's stuff all the time!
I say people stop hating on Logan he wasnt doing it for views also he blurred the face out and called for help
That's just dumb
You guys just want views. Leave logan alone
my children and I  walked in and found my deceased husband their father 2yrs ago in April the trauma and pain is unreal Logan Paul you should be ashamed ...lost my uncle to suicide 5 yrs ago buried him right before Christmas..my father was an attempt when I was six... two of my best friends ended their lives a yr ago ..you have no idea how disrespectful that was.. and how many you hurt...I hope someday you humble yourself.
I am not a fan of him, and do not really watch any of his videos but when I watched this specific video, I just saw a man that encountered a dead body for the first time. Everybody reacts differently to this kind of situation, some cries, some screams, and believe me some people do giggle or laugh. Its a defense mechanism of our body, fight or flight. He obviously fought his feeling of fear by giggling since it is a form of forcing your body to counteract the negative feeling. He did say the right words on the video on the suicide awareness, but definitely looks disrespectful because of the way he acted for which a lot of people do not understand and will never understand because they have a different coping mechanism.
yes Yu is right..... All the youtuber is jealous from paul that's why he is making the big new of it.. and they are posting again & again what he posted. If paul was wrong then why all youtuber is posting his video again & again and getting lots of likes.
i know you guys i seen the behind the seens you set stuff up oh braking news u guy are a peace of crap
Logan Paul is an absolute tool. He didn't just post the video but is seen laughing.    Stop making stupid people famous
Godzilla should of killed Logan Paul :).
Dabbing on those  hater
STOP BEING MEAN TO MY FAV YT STAR
Not his fault
He awesome
So what l
Dang this was on the news?!
He dont deserve this, he just showed something that some peoples find bad, but he didnt murdered someone, he didnt stole or destroyed something, he just recorded something, there was so much worse things recorded on youtube. He is not bad guy, but he was on wrong place in wrong time.
I would like to know why was he laughing its not funny its truly sad and he is a JACKASS 
15 million subscriber's sounds impressive but all that tells me is that there's at least 15 million idiots out there with nothing better to do with there free time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqoynX5850&t=1038s
It's not his fault he didn't mean to find that
IN DEFENSE OF LOGAN: making a distinction about how a body should or should not be treated after death based upon how the person died is not morality, but cultural stigma. Judging people based on how they act around a dead body is also not fair. There is no requirement to respect a dead body or care about how it happened. Death means there is nothing left to care about, and hence, why dead bodies are burned or buried. In India they do mass burnings in the streets, and it is normal to see. This is all cultural projection and delusion. Also, posting a video to making money from said dead body can also not be wrong, because many types of business make money from dead bodies. Intending to make money from death is not wrong. Death is not wrong, and can be funny. Suicide is generally not funny, but there are suicide jokes. So if it is not the 'way they acted' nor the 'act of making money' nor the 'suicide of some guy', then what is the actual wrongdoing? This has more to do with a cultural rejection of the reality of death than anything else. people die all the time for various reasons, we watch movies of people being killed and it is fake. So how can a video of a real dead person be bad, when all of our fake videos of death are considered award winning films?
You just showed a video talking about what he did. Not an actual image of what he showed, but...you are doing the same thing.
Subscribers not followers. And i don't let him win money. HEY EVERYONE LET'S MAKE LOGAN LOSE HIS MONEY BY NOT WATCHING HIS VIDS. I DON'T GET CLICKBAITED
I never liked the paul brothers i stick to rice gum and cjsocool
stop trying to make him feel worse
Shut up you dummys
Everyone makes mistakes
Just leave Logan Paul alone he is just a YouTuber if you guys do something to him will find you and I will hurt because of you guys looking pods with everywhere he's been in my school you've been in my house has been on the news everywhere that you can follow what it says use to title it says he can do what he wants with it cuz it's his so just leave them alone or you will get a face to face and a fist somewhere else

fuck the people who are hating on Logan Paul. he just wanted to make awareness for suicide. its the haters that turned it upside down. he didn't mean any harm or disrespect to the person who cumited suicide,the family or what the video was supposed to be about.
Also the apology he did was so f&@!? Fake! Also his response I smell FAKER!!! F@&? YOU LOGAN!!!
I literally unsubscribed to him when I saw that video.
FUCK ALL OF YOU THAT JATE LOGAN PAUL CHECK OUT MY COMMENT ON  Logan Paul's so sorry video

HE MADE ONE MISTAKE MY GOD HE MAKES MONEY OF OF YOUTUBE YOU GUYS R ASSHOLES HE IS GETTING KICKED OFF YOUTUBE AND SAID SRRY MY GOD HE IS SRRY YOU PPL R ASS HOLES
You can't take back a mistake that will ruin your career...
People Get Offended To Easily
If he wanted suicide prevention he should of had a serious attitude and suicide hotline in the link
Why are you guys even talking about people like he said he was sorry okay so you don't have to make it worse sir cuz all his fans are going to start unsubscribing and he need the followers so don't be putting him down
He was being a knuckle head. I love him but this was to far. I still love you Logan and please post again soon.
I hate Logan
When I watched a movie it was probably named The Forest and I thought all the dead bodies where just fake and acting but when I watched this I was like is this the same forest I saw in one movie and I didnt realize it was maybe real and WHY DEAR GAWD DID HE LAUGHHHH AT A DEAD BODY 
Rip money
No shit what did you think was going to be in SUICIDE Forest
then y tf did logan show the body if he is gonna raise suicide provention
Look I get hes done this can we stand back and forget this its a new day its in the past let him start brand new!!!
Who agrees?????
He does deserve a 2nd chance But, He needs to learn how to respect others first. its ok being silly, but dont offend , or disrespect others.Follow the rules
Leave him ALONE HE IS APOLLOGISING TO THE WORLD OKAY
Hey your  rude i am a fan
I've always seen Logan Paul as a Mindless, idiotic, childish, dim-wit. But this surely crossed the line. If they wanted to keep going, they should have turned off the camera. This just makes my view of him worsen. He's still a childish idiot. And he deserves a much larger punishment.
*_Yep, ABC News covered the story._*
Disgusting..
If it was for awareness why the FUCK would u laugh at it? Fake ass apology I ever heard 
I used to like logan paul not anymore
everyone defending suicide should just do it im sick of the whining..
Who's this thing
Frick Logan Paul!!
how is it disrespecting the japanese culture if he's not personally mocking the japanese culture
I don't think news anchors know that they are called subscribers
Wow he took it way to far i think he should not have done that i think it is rude and disappointed  i never liked him anyway so
Welp thats one way to start 2018 :| He doesnt know da wae

Why does Logan Paul curse

Ok I'm sorry but I thought it was funny!

This whole this whole news is a mistake
F*** all the haters all the people are using him as clickbait
If you...
So... If Logan Paul is quitting then should I just rip my loving shirt cause I will if he quits.  Also who wants cupcakes. If you like this Co.lmment you get a free cupcake.
Logan deserves another chance,It was just his first time and he didn't know what to do.Im just glad Jake Paul isn't out.
Gallows humor

Mikayla Garcia But now youre saying You are spelling is wrong. Also, its grammar, not spelling.
ITS YOURE
*Youre* SPELLING IS WRONG.
Frances Voteary 
Ahhh brilliant
Is not allegedly . Is not apparent
OMG LOGAN
he hasn't even uploaded in 2 weeks. I miss seeing his content everyday
Wow, I can't believe there are people in the comments still defending this asshole.
This was NOT a mistake, this was a deliberate act. He CHOSE to film the dead body, and he CHOSE to upload the video instead of calling the police. I can only imagine how the family members of the victim feel about the corpse being mocked, disrespected, and being used as a cheap way to get views. Logan doesn't deserve any sympathy. This was his own fault
HE IS ONLY YOUNG! 22-23? FOR GODS SAKE, IF A 10YEAR OLD DID THIS WOULD YOU STILL BE THIS MAD? OR WOULD U B EVEN MORE MAD IF A 70year OLD DID THIS? HE IS A DUMB KID TRYING TO LIVE HIS LIFE (not to be rude to LOGAN) HE DOESNT DESERVE THIS. ITS SERIOUS I KNOW AND MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM SUICIDE BUT THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. HE WAS IN THE WRONG BUT GET OVER IT
Logang4life
Tabitha Thompson Shitgang4life
Wow. Your stupid. Did you even watch the vid???
Liked ur comment
Freedom Fighter lol 
I defended him during the suicide forest event but after he payed someone to blame Shane on being a pedophile made me snap and unsubscribe from his stupid channel I hope hes never welcomed on YT again after what he did.
Logen Paul is stupid for showing a dead body
News forecaster:Logan Paul has over 15 million followings 
Me:U LIVE UNDER A ROCK BRUH?
Me:HE HAS OVER 19 MILLION FOLLOWERS U FORGOT HIS OTHER CHANNEL
I gotta be real honest
1. if u take the channel down no fun on youtube
2.ik he did something wrong but he has a good point
3.no one said it was a crime
Last but not least 4.if youtube takes his channel down our lives will be ruined
GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE HE WAS IN SHOCK WHAT ELCE WAS HE SUPPOSED TO DO
My pussy hurts because Logan Paul showed a dead body :(
Fuck you guys that are being mean to Logan paul
I'm gonna need a play by play about what actually happened in this video.  Did he poke a body with a stick or laugh hysterically or something? 
Listen,  ive had several close to me commit suicide,  lived through 3 attempts myself,  and battle with constant suicidal depression every day of my life. Some people joke, some don't,  that's not my problem. 
My problem is with me,  I'm suicidal because, well,  that's just who and how I am...I have mental illness.  
What's laughable is that suicide prevention has incredibly long wait times on their live chat (that crashes)  and on hold for over the phone consultation... as I found out just last night in fact.  25 years of dealing with this shit and last night was the first time I ever tried to reach out,  and imagine my surprise when there was no help in sight, no one to talk to. Pretty fucking sobering,  had me thinking it was just my luck and eventually I came out of it, like so many times before. 
This dipshit being in an international destination for suicide and filming it doesn't seem any more terrible than the hundreds of other documentaries or videos about it.  
How about reaching out to people who need help.  Use your anger for something productive. The fact That there's an entire forest dedicated to suicide should be a pretty big hint that suicide is an ever growing pandemic. Quit worrying about the YouTube guy,  go help people in need.
I *HATE* him so much he's so terrible and annoying  *sorry*
All of you are sick
Thank god I didn't see the video
He did not meen it .logang 4 life.the strongest family in the universe!!!!!
Delete this video
nobody wants to commit suicide because they don't want to be in one of his videos
he did prevent suicide
Wowwwww
Am so sad for logan i miss him so much
lol dude, either they are so brainwasshed that they can't even think right, or they are in extreme denial...
Logan is an idiot! How could these 7 year olds forgive him?!
U are mindless
Daniela Rodriguez guys don't insult this kid he or she is probably 10 or 12 years old so they don't have the intelligence to understand why this is a problem and why is a bad thing to do I just hope all these kids never follow his example
Mans is hot check the statistics his fault higher than yours proof if you check the statistics i know people make mistakes but he fucking filmed a dead body just think if it was a family member of your's!
15 mil FOLLOWERS!? Its subscribers.
OMG  HE  SORRY  FOR GIVE  HIM >:(
NO SHIT SHERLOCK THERES A DEAD BODY IN THE SUICIDE FOREST
Wow great job Logan Paul you're losing subscribers! WELL FUCK YOU IDIOT
I support you 100% logan it was a mistake, and everyone does that. I can understand why someone think it was wrong. But HEY you made one mistake, other people on YouTube has made way bigger mistakes then you... I just want to say that I support you 100000% and i understand your mistake
Ps. Stay strong and ceep going. And don't let anyone's opinion stop you
It's not one mistake to find something like that, joke about it, record it, edit it, upload it, and then do another video with the exact same behavior the day after like nothing happened.
Dis Bitch
Yeeeaahhh
He is an INFLUENCER
fucking moron
they are all jealous of him bro
I dont like logan. Hes sick in the head.
Quit taking about Logan paul
Agin why was logan paul was bad just reseaching ?
Guys, we all know he did an idiot thing, but he only done one mistake, he didn't mean that.Can we just forgive him?
God can forgive tho so why we can't?
Dont take him down
Dont take him down

I don't know about this but if you feel strongly that his channel should be deleted there is a petition in this link that you can sign to help support the removal of his channel.  https://www.change.org/p/youtube-delete-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel      
                                                    Personally I believe people should be given second chances.
omg i love logan paul an so sad WHY LOGAN WHY ???? :,(
HEY TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.... (Read all)YOU KNOW WHY YOUR JUDGING OTHERS? WHY ARE YOU HATING LOGAN IF YOU ONLY KNOW NOBODY IS PERFECT AND ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD MAKE MISTAKES........I KNOW LOGAN MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUT WHY ARE YOU KEEP JUDGING HIM????

"We are very good judges in judging others mistakes yet very good lawyers in defending our own mistakes". Please forgive
The rest of his material from Japan has also been appalling, but the Aokigahara incident crossed lines that should never be crossed.

And theres no need for hate its supposed to be a funny comment i see you dont quite understand that. Thats embarrassing
Hansel And Gretel why..?
90% percent of people who comment " jake paul is cool and he didnt do anything wrong are the ones who havent hit puberty or gotten a period" the other 10% are fucking retards
He deserves to ge a second chances frget him its only one mistake everyone makes mistakes
im not a logan paul fan but everyone makes mistakes jeez give the guy a break bet most people make mistakes but just cuase their not famous they dont get bashed on

You messed up bro but I am still your fan
Plz Logan,can you post more videos plz I miss Watching you
"I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet" now how will laughing and just plain out being disrespectful to that person and persons family make a "positive ripple" on the internet???
Go fuck your self
I'm a Jake pauler now
Troll, 0:34, "He has 15 million followers on Youtube". She had to use the word "followers".
Idc i love logan
He not a shame
Wow best year :-)
I can understand filming it because there are a lot of reasons someone would do that but posting that shit on YouTube crazy.
They call u lp 
U were on a holiday but 
U may be sorry
Your making a big deal about it
Liam Serrie You dont have to show a kid a fucking dead body to learn about death.
Mans is hot check the statistics his fault higher than yours proof if you check the statistics i know people make mistakes but he fucking filmed a dead body just think if it was a family member of your's!
Tyler Tries It exactly!!
tonisio dumb ass!! the body is really there he took the video of a dead body and showed it in the world while laughing and looks excited thats the point dumbass! and he is not a news caster he is doing this to make money of his own. lets say u died and he found ur body and he was laughing and excited because he was the 1st one who found ur dead body while ur family is looking for you. U think ur family will be excited and happy too that people around the world watching ur dead body in his video?
ok tell ur family now when u died u need Logan to video ur dead body and well see how many views he can get.
Your channel will be dead just like you
is it just me or r ppl being rude im just standing up for logan BTW FUCK THE HATERS (sorry for my languge)
fuck off logans a kind hearted man
This kid said he was 8 in another comment. That explains how he finds enjoyment in the vapid and idiotic Paul brothers.
How old are you? Fan of his?
If YouTube deletes a major news orginization itll practically be over for YouTube, they cater to the powerful and weed out any opposing opinions, like what they do with jake paul
It was just an accident
hold up..... *followers on youtube*
she said daily "show" and followers on youtube lol
Note to all Logan Paul fans who still like him and support him: Say a famous Japanese person came to the U.S.A. Started saying I LIKE MACDONALDS and started putting their arms out wide, and hold their breath, so they looked fat like an average american. Is that respectful? Not one bit. Lets also say they disrespect our customs like Logan did, Is everyone in Japan gonna think thats okay? Probably not. So, I just wanna know why you still support him, because there was no way him finding a dead man in a Suicide Forest was a MISTAKE, it was a CHOICE. His vlogs in japan clearly shows he disrespects them. Infact he should be partially labeled as RACIST. You have no idea how much it angers people like me and the Japanese. Logan isnt a good person, he just makes himself look good Then do something a non-decent human being would do and then makes himself look good again. ( at least thats my interpretation ) Point is, please, just please dont act like Logan Paul he is incompetent, Ignorant, and overall a non-decent human being. So shut up about him being a good human being, because he is NOT,
I hate him when I first heard he was getting banned I yelled YES!!!! JUST ONE MORE TO GO NOW
Wow logang must hate 2018....
Kit Kat Wrapper but I till hate him
Kit Kat Wrapper LOL it IS logang!
Ava Tamanui learn how to spell Logan
This is all over youtuber
Me: HAPPY NEW YEARS 2018!!!!
(Five hours later) 
News:"COULD THIS BE THE END OF THE YOUTUBERS CAREER?!"
Me:.......This year.....is already awfully painful
They are not followers they are subs
the tittle was not that
This is old 
No I'm 16
Logan Paul was disrespectful to the dead body and the Japanese culture. You shouldnt use a dead body as a thumbnail and take a video of it.
Christian Chim Chims Missing Jams I made a video of how LP almost died I would appreciate it if you checked it out
It's over shut up about it your just making a big deal about it and everyone else
Hey, bitches. Im here. Get one before we run out!
DaReelpoodiepie  that's where the babies come from right?
jack wack attack joe you know its called 'suicide forest' for a reason right ?
SUBSCRIBERS NOT FOLLOWERS
Abc you ruin every thing
Logon Paul I believe you did not do it
fuck u all not logan
His fans are 10 year old lifeless cunts
Stop bote hate logan ok pls hey bed not now ok
NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY YOUR IN, YOU NEVER TAKE A VIDEO OF A DEAD PERSON AND SMILE, LAUGH, AND MAKE JOKES ABOUT IT!!!!!!! WHERE IS THIS GUY'S RESPECT!?!?!?! WHO ARE HIS PARENTS!?!?!?
My name is Angela king love your work still
Logan you are a OK in my book sorry about what is happening
Stop being mean to Logan Paul it was just a mistake stop stop STOP!!!!!
Suicides have dropped 37% because of him....
I heard that he laughed at the body, but I dont want to get hate, but maybe theres some special effect when going to suicide forest that causes you to do things you wouldnt normally do.
Be i maverick bitches 
Logan is the best nothing will change
I dont see anything?
hahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha LOGAN PAUL FOR LIFE FUCK THE HATERS
Eye doesn't drive a $250,000 car. Jake Paul does. Jake Paul has a Lamborghini huracan performante. JAKE PAULERS NUMBER 1. Like if you're a Jake Pauler. Go to fanjoy.co/jakepaul
He was just recording and.he stumbled across a dead body like cmon he didn't do anything
MARKEL TV "he didn't do anything." That's the standard response for you dumb Paul fans. He did do something, he recorded a dead body. Stop defending him and saying he did do anything wrong, cause he did
Ppl it's not Logan's fault..ur probably saying wat the fuck..but the place he visited is called SUICIDE M'NT..or wat ever..but then an again it is also Logan's fault.. because MOST ..I said most ppl..MOST ppl has common sense..an..for ..Logan an his friends it probably didn't kicked them in the ass..to say this is not the right thing to do..take off the cam an call the ambulance..guys ik this is hard for u to understand..but I'm with Logan..he said he was sorry probably about a million times..I'm sticking with Logan
            -#loganster
Given the rest of his videos from Tokyo showcase the same dickish behavior, sure didn't seem like he was sorry.
"apparent"
BOOOOOOM y de repente un comentario en espaol
XD his ass is an bad influence
I dont care he still said i am so sorry
He did not mean to I whach him he is okay
Nooo,  Fuck YouTube,  u didn't have to kick this YouTuber ;(
We love Logan come back on YouTube get him back Logan come back Logan come back Logan come back Logan come back Logan come back Logan come
Unsubscribe to Logan Paul
Paul said?   his name is logan xd
Holy shit everybody needs to calm the fuck down everyone makes mistakes assholes leave him and his life alone if you don't appreciate him
Now he is off youtube
'Apparent' when you forget to do your homework
I want to forget about all this
Mmmmmm ghost are real I hope this earth will vanish mmmmm
SHUT THE FUCK UP DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT LOGAN!!
Y'all need to check out the other people who did that too not saying I support him but really
Okay,Okay. Lets all be honest this has dragged on far too long. Its a shame what Logan did but are we honestly helping the world by hating and wanting to watch Logan Paul get destroyed! It was wrong of him to do what he did and he should face judgment, but arent you just as terrible as him if you continue to drag this out? People can die, like for example Logan or his fans. His content is cheesy but many adore him and dont know what to do without him. Are you willing to break more hearts and let more people die to sucide? Its not out of the ordinary to say his fans may do what the man did because they feel alone now that they YouTube star abandoned them. He did wrongs but honesty I bet some of you would DO THE EXCALT same thing. Posting graveyards on Snapchat or dead animals being carried around in your arms on instagram. So unless your pure AF I suggest you shut the hell up and move on I am so done with everyone thinking they are saints cuz your not! Grow up!!
Please dont ban longan Paul he apologized and I know that doesnt change anything but please to ban him from youtube we all make mistakes he took down the video he has inspired so many people and if you ban him The Who will inspire all these people
Don't feel sorry for Logan Paul at all. He was 22 when this event happened, that means he is a grown man. He should already know what is right and wrong.
Logan ruined 2018!!!
I don't care about it he's so sorry I feel bad for logging poor logie
Followers on YouTube I thought it was subscribers
they took it to far
WELL DUH
"mistakes"? here's the thing. he never regretted what he did when he recorded the scene. or when he edited it. or when he uploaded it. he regretted it when the people he looked up to, like aaron paul called him living trash. making mistakes is fine, but only when you learn from it. otherwise it's what people call stupidity.
I don't think warning parents that their kids are worshipping a racist psychopath who laughs at corpses is "too far". Logan took his ridiculous stunt too far. Parents need a wake-up call that they can't just let their kids wander youtube unsupervised.
Mr. 303 oh ok well I can say what I want to if you don't like it then don't  comment oh ok that's all I got to say bc your mad bc i hate Logan and you like him so bye
Logan Paul says sorry why not jake
15 million followers, I'm dying!!!! XD
Logan god
I HATE THESE PEOPLE
i'd rather watch jake paul now
Well I'm subscribe to him but then I will unsubscribe to him :/
Shut up u are so annoying and I don't know it was one mistake 1 mistake so stop
Fuck him tbh 
Oh come on it is not a learning process he's 21 for crying outloud
Why can everyone else post the video of Logan finding the body all around social media but he cant even post videos on his YT channel
I love logan  what he did yeah it was wrong but still love his vidoes
Leave him the fuck alone u guys are not great at all so just shut the fuck up and mind ur own damn business
Back to hell longan pall and jake pall what brat
My teacher saw this and banned anyone from talking about him in her class
Logan wasn't trying to be rude I would have done the same thing and after he showed us the video he gave a whole speech on how suicide is not the answer and you guys are giving him all sorts of trash you guys are the ones that are messed up
And I assume you also see nothing wrong with harassing random people in Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Tsukiji because "Tokyo is a playground"?
And rhe fact that he said "this is a first I YouTube history " means even if someone found a dead body didnt post it like use UR head paul
Hah just jelaous
Logan will return with a positive thing in youtube and passing pewdipie
Logan did nuthin rong loggang 5 life who cares if he filmed a swicide viccim the dumbass was alreddy dead omg he kills himself why can't loggang film yall is hippocristical
At Least I watched The video Before It Got Deleted xD
Why him there is other people that found dead bodies
Respect the dead, man. He and his friends were having a blast "experiencing" seeing for the first time someone who died from suicide. Instant karma, right there.
Logan paul made a mistake.Everyone makes mistakes.Give him a break.I  Logan Paul.
Logan4Life
    ?       
Logan gives all of us content creators a bad name. I'm not that big, but I'm still one of them....
IDIOT xd
U may not know that your CHILD is watching this
Oh thanks for finding my dead body. Got lost there and accidentally fell from the tree.
*E D G Y*
WhiteFire 121 
"Uni-Chan" I'm sorry but you're obviously a child.
This isn't a joke child if you want to make someone laugh your not doing it right, joking about somebody's death is very disrespectful, especially to the family who lost they're dear family member, I'm not going to rant I don't want to waste my time on you, and I'm afraid your brain won't 
handle much words and it'll just forget my *important* reminder, suicide isn't a joke and it should never be one, 
And if your a grown up, well Then that's a shame, laughing and joking about something that should never actually be joked about, Please learn your lesson, 
And if you *learned* After reading this 
*Thank you*
Nice hat you pole smoker!!!!!!!!!!
He wasnt really there to me hes a nobody and frankly I never cared his extinance
I am so happy that a watched  that video, the people who didn't saw that video stop saying shit
Like Logan Said HE MAKES HIMSLEF FEEL BETTER BY LAUGHING!! LIKE SHE SAID! LOGAN DOES DAILY VIDEOS!! NOT ANY MORE. PLEASE COME BACK LOGAN!!
He had so many subs now he has 8,000 subs
Your like Jake paul
I wish if they give me his youtube channel i will make a lot of money
The higher you fly, the harder you FALL!
so who's the bad guy now the guy who films it or the people who keeps showing it to people if you guys cared at all you will not do this. but hey everything for the views right ?? your no better than logan paul
Lol he said 2018 was his year and then this straight away happened.
YOU NEWS PEOPLE BETTER FUCKING ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT IM FUCKING SAYING, FOR GOD SAKE. WERE HUMANS PEOPLE, STOP FUCKING DOING THIS SHIT. AND WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF THIS FUCKING CHANNEL, INSTEAD OF YOU GUYS WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME DOING THIS SHIT, EDITING AND FUCKING SITTING YOUR LAZY ASSES  ON YOUR CHAIRS, GET SOME REAL AND FUCKING USEFUL NEWS
His car is worth more then my life

The memes is strong for this one.
Jake paul lost Disney,Logan paul lost Youtube....

I miss logan paul I hope his channel doesn't end
His name is not paul
Why didnt youtube permanently ban him?
He was saying it to "prevent" suicide yet he was holding back a laugh like wtf
Here's another Logan Paul Dead Body Parody Video UNSEEN FOOTAGE
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgv1GMpGgqY&t=6s
I bet YouTube won't cancel his show though...
I did
aww I wanna cry! I feel so bad for him! Don't get me wrong I was mad when he was Tokyo and making jokes but I forgave him because we have all made bad mistakes, obviously this one was just espeacially bad. And it will take time for people to forgive him but at least he has me to start it off! "Sometimes, you have to make a big mistake to figure out how to make things right, mistake are painful but they are the only way to find out the reality" -Unknown
abc bs noose jealous AF for not getting their camera there first
Bullshit
That disrespectful shit deserved the reality check. The MULTIPLE ones that are out there
I'm glad that I never watched Logan Paul's videos.
ABC, we all know your only dong this story for views, f*ck off.
R.I.P. Logan 
If the world's greatest douchebag scientists worked for an entire lifetime committed to the goal of creating the world's biggest douchebag, the douchebag they'd create wouldn't even be .000001% as big of a douchebag as Logan Paul.
I Still Don't get What's the Big Issue here because Logan Paul Stumbled upon a dead body, It wasn't his Fault. What Would You Do? Maybe Take off running and Screaming uhh my point exactly.
ShiftyGotHeat  you're ignorant that's why you don't get it and sadly whoever raised you (or is raising you) did not teach you about respecting others or respecting yourself bc if you did there's no way you would have left such a stupid ass comment :-/
TURN OFF THE CAMERA. DON'T UPLOAD THE VIDEO, DON'T WASTE TIME EDITING IT EITHER, AND I PROBABLY WOULDN'T LAUGH AT IT. USE YOUR BRAIN.
ShiftyGotHeat IDK MABE TURN THE CAMRA OFF GOD IDIOTS
Really....? You don't see anything wrong with posting a dead body on youtube where a bunch of little kids could possibly see it and be scarred for life...? Get help. Delusional fan.
I trust jake paul now! 
Like Boi who told u you can show an Asian dead body????!!!!
Wowww
Thats not how you raise awareness you idiot. this is disgusting
Who cares what would you  expect, you can look up all of this and it is and it is much worse then what Logan post
First of all why in the world is this Park or Forest still legal, I Think its not his fault
Wow he messed up so bad that he got on ABC WOW
Omg he said that they
Didnt planed this!
ok FUCK YOU ABC NEWS
oh god
oh god
oh god
he didnt even know it was going to be on the clip
Smh i don't even know what all to say cuz the video says everything... What's wrong with people nowadays?? Anything for publicity and views?? Too thirsty. Some ppl just don't need to be vlogging and simply on YouTube...
Havent watched him before then, and wont watch him after this. I know people do some dumb things, but why would you post something like that in the first place?
Logan Paul rules
Adrian Satawake Said a Grown Man Who is 22 Years Old and Posted a Video of a Dead Person On a Area Nicknamed the Suicide Forest
ya it was dumb but it was his what he says its just dumb just forget
why does Logan have 2 be such an idiot he made a mockery of people who have tragically passed and what did he do FRICKEN LAUGH AT IT that was very immature , ugh the paul brothers can be SUCH IDIOTS
I thought youtube was going to take Paul off. Bullshiter
What the heck
Can someone explain to me why people are angry abt what he did?  I don't really understand.
I don't even know who the fuck he is tbh.
Thats sad
I now hate him even *more*
I dont think he did anything wrong
I do not watch him
He have better apologize for that.
jesus
I was expecting Jake Paul to do this shit.
Who tf cares let ppl watch what they want to watch
Please dont be meam to logan
See? This shows the average age of viewers for Logan Paul. Kindergarteners. And now they have seen a dead body
Shantel Ramirez no
Logan..is just, *HORRIBLE AND STUPID*
Meam lol oh your meaning meme here's a meme for yah DO YOU KNO DE WAE!
Mans is hot check the statistics his fault higher than yours proof if you check the statistics i know people make mistakes but he fucking filmed a dead body just think if it was a family member of your's!
Look its a mistake deal with it
R.I.P logan
He did not do it on purpurpose
Eh this will just blow over like everything else
Yup.. He really fucked up this time
No wonder Disney fired him ahead of time
So inconsiderate
Bullshit
Woah jeez logan
He was sick sick people do idiotic stuff he didnt know what to do some ppl laugh of nervousness  but theres no need for names thats just uncalled for
How the HELL did Logan expect to raise SUICIDE AWARENESS by showing a dead body on screen and laughing about it!? I hope to the gods that his fanbase FINALLY sees how much of a bad person he is for not only that, but the mockery he did in Japan about its culture, which destroyed any attempt for a person of a foreign country to come into Japan in hopes of building a positive relationship.
White people do anything for attention.
Dang, didnt even know Logan was on the news yet.. I didnt see this on tv..
Three words for Logan Paul. What. A. Twat
as soon as i heard the man say most popular on youtube.... bruuhhhhhhhh i clicked out doesnt know his shit
Let's not talk about all the people posting videos in the same forest.
His aPAULogy was very stupid. :/
Can you fucking shut up about it nobody cares anymore
If I ever see Logan Paul in the streets Im gonna jump him.
I dont need an excuse to vindicate this persons actions
Just remember this.
You watch his clip.
You see your mother,father,brother,sister,husband,wife,son or daughter hanging there dead.
Which more important or deserves more dignity and respect ?
Your call.
#sarcasim
HinoTE ur mom sucked all the literary terms outta me
Wow a youtuber posted a negarive video on social media we have nothing else going on in the digital world so lets focus on tht
Why do people follow this guy? Fucking clown. Probably bunch of 15 year olds tbh. Any grown person with any brain has to find him repulsive and immature.
Jerr S Absolutely. I cant believe these kids and sponsors put money in his pocket. He was a so cal rich boy growing up anyways. Spoiled and entitled prick is really what he is.
IThuggerI people who have no brain follow him. They are also the ones who are probably doing the Tide Pod challenge. It would make a lot of sense
https://youtu.be/cQs9sF--2gA miren esta parodia
I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER PEOPLE CAN DO IT BUT NOT LOGAN UR A BITCH GOVERNMENT
Mature way of handing dead body is record or photo (as back up plan when things gone wrong but never to publish on public and never do it to get views) and call police.
What i dont get is why he was laughing when he saw the body thats disrespectful
he was showing reality he did it for money
Save the logang
He's still fucking young. He made a mistake. If you've never made a mistake then go ahead judge but if you have SHUT TGE HELL UP ABOUT IT ALREADY.
Lucasmmy 52415 he didn't make a mistake if he knew what he was doing. He went into a forest famous for suicides, what was he expecting to find? A plate of cookies?
He's getting what he deserves
Thank god
....and people called me crazy when I told them Logan Paul was no good.
Jarret knows DA wae
save longan paul from this torcher
I hate Logan paul
Logan left a warning in the beginning of the video though
HE IS STILL A GOOD PERSON
Ok so hate on me all you want, but what would you do in Logans shoes. You can say the logical thing and turn off the camera, but you dont know how you will act in a situation like that. Yes that may happen but just imagine the amount of shock going through your body after seeing a dead body hanging. When these things happen you dont act the same. You act like an idiot under pressure. Logan didnt do the right thing, that doesnt mean he did this intentionally. Thank you.
logan got band from yt...
And what if we watch he bitich
I don't care if Logan made that video I still watch his videos cuz he is the best
its cold subscribers get it right
i feel really bad for logan :(
Pray for logan paul everyone  makes mistakes
hes just a kid who got it wrong - a wake up call that whoring the media  is not really  living
f u Abc
Ele foi muito infeliz ao postar este tipo de vdeo, ainda mais rindo do cenario morbido ao qual onde as pessoas vo para se suicidar.
Its subs not followers
Poor Logan...
Let him back on youtube
Idc i still love him
he's not sorry for nothing
of if you go look he went to the temple  that this man went  to before  he died  and Logan  got kicked out for disrespecting it
sick pig Paul  that's his new name my child will be ban from watching  his crap
can anyone give me a link to the original video? thanks
he deleted it I saw it as soon as itcame out
Vivi mannequin check somewhere on internet
it got deleted after 10 minutes
Vivi mannequin the video was deleted
Logan took it down because YouTube doesnt wanna lose money
Its soo sad to see & hear this! Im deeply sorry for the family of the victim but also feel sorry for LP fans / subscribers! As they look up to him some of them being very very young they are defending him for something which is morally wrong & unacceptable!!!  I dont feel anger from this video...just sadness   xxx
He wanted not to offend the Japanese yes he's is a hypocrite for going against his own claim. Very spoilt brat.
Guys listen it wasn't Logan Paul's fault for filming that suicide video but give a guy a heart
Logan Paul and Jake Paul suck
He is raising awareness around suicide by laughing at suicide ???? He has some mental illness
Everyone unsubscribe from him NOW
manic mouse77 Judging by what you said, you seem like one of those brainwashed people.
#getalifeyouretard
Did he delete the vid
Logan is a stuipid and I saw the video and HE DIDNT BLURR THE BODY OUT
Soulless selfish post-millennial entitled cry baby youtubers are many.
I'm so triggered by his shitty ugly ass Toy Story alien hat
man even ABC news tried to get views off logan paul clickbzit. thats hilerious
WHY DO EVERYONE THAT DOES NOT WATCHS HIS VIDEOS THINK HE IS A BAD PERSON THIS IS THE 1 BAD VIDEO SO JUST SHUT THE FOCK UP
His entire trip to Japan showcased the exact same levels of douchebaggery and disrespect as the one Aokigahara video. The video wasn't the problem, it was a symptom of a much bigger underlying issue.
PLEASE Stop this he has made youtube videos every day but he has not posted in some days
Dear god, 
Please forgive Logan for what he did and sin those who wrote hateful comments.
WAit so...Logan Paul wont make videos anymore? like EVER
#loganpaulisoverparty . Its the only way we can end trash paul
WE ALL LOVE LOGAN PAUL!! WE ARE THE PART OF THE LOGANG!! Listen, he was nervous, he didn't know what to do. He probably just never saw a did body until know so you such a BUTTHOLE. And all those famous people on twitter (Taylor Swift) you are talking about about yourself!! HE WENT TO A FOREST WHERE DEAD PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR JUST RANDOMLY DIED AT THAT FORSET SO SHUT UP! (Plz like if your part of the logang)
Heck no
This is sad
Wow people are assholes against Logan
Hey everyone. Ive made a video over Logan Paul. Im pro Logan paul so dont watch unless you are into him
Haha Logan everyone see your exposed
These celebrities needs to shut the fuck up. They lucky that wasn't me with that mistake cause I'll bash those pricks twice on Sundays
Why are all news missing he laughed at the dead body
I'm a kid
They said that he had 15 million follows TO LET YOU KNOW DUMB NEWS THERE SUBSCRIBERS KNOWN AS THE LOGANG!!!!!!!!
Justin Bieber is still going strong after all of his messed up mistakes, everyone is leeching on his fame by using his name and face as thumbnail. Go figure something original to stand out. And stop this hate, it feels like the internet is bullying him right now, why should that be allowed? I think he has had enough eyeopeners, let this 22 year old kid learn from his fault.
#standbylogan

Can you just leave him alone he didnt mean to do it some people make mistakes
Logan Paul: *makes jokes about dead body*
Logan Paul: I didn't do it for view, I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet.

Paul brother is falling down
thank god he is gone
Nervous laughter is laughter evoked from an audience's expression of embarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement. Nervous laughter is usually less robust in expression than "a good belly laugh", and may be combined with confused glances or awkward silence on the part of others in the audience. Nervous laughter is considered analogous to a courtesy laugh, which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to move a situation along more quickly, especially when the comedian is pausing for laughter.

I never even liked Logan Paul, but like who the fuck laughs at someone who ended theyre life like wtf, and just because he apologized doesnt mean everything is alright, I hope he quits YouTube bcuz I really ALWAYS hated him! What an asshole I hope he burns in hell!!!
He shouldve stopped and called the police
I posted this on Logan Pauls video but I guess people didnt get the memo ok so for all the people on the comments wetting your selfves about him laughing at a dead body here is the definition of nervous laughter: Nervous laughter is laughter evoked from an audience's expression of embarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement.

You are mean
To believe my sister is part of the Logang, He is sick, what he did is sick, and he makes me sick .
He didnt know it was the suicide forest because it was written in Japanese
Even if you can't read the Japanese name (), its reputation is pretty common knowledge. Take your bullshit excuses elsewhere.
Its subscibers not followers don't take offense I am not trying to be mesn but ya
Did anyone read the "You're an idiot" from Sophie Turner's tweet in Sansa's voice?
So wht whats worst is his younger brother Jake Paul assulting woman
I'll take "Whataboutism" for $600, Alex.
Bullshit Lies from Logan!
I hate the pauls
If u are going to say the Logan Paul story ,say it all  dont just say the things he did wrong
Like the part where the rest of his trip to Japan shows the same behavior that got him into trouble with this video?
Not trying to hate. " NEWS".  But that is not right and I'm a kid but DO NOT HATE ever again ok because that is not right and your an adults u should have learned that it is not okay to hate so no more HATE  I'm is the Logan's life and that is not right BYE
                      Please Read Not Reply
I'm not subscribing idiot
Shut up
**** YOU!

This is why most of the people in our class hate Logan Paul 
Only one person in our class likes Logan Paul, and she's a fucking furry
Why would Logan post that video he is gay
Abc news you liar rip off
R.I.P 2018
If the relatives of the dead person are commiting suicides too because of humilation, then it's totally done. 
Those godfucking shame society bullies in Japan, To think they made that man commit suicide. And they didn't see Logan Paul coming, are you telling me then those bullies are commiting suicide too? If that happens then Logan aw ENGOUH OF THIS!!! I want to give to all an clear advice right now for god sake!
                                          DONT COMMIT SUICIDE
he's sorry give him a second chance  he's not a bad person he's not one of them people who says there sorry just to get more views and yes he made a mistake and he owned up to that and u can be mad at him but u need to know he's really sorry god bless u all
I need to stop hearing about all this logan paul being punished for a youtube video shane dawson being called a pedo for his jokes, joey graceffa and his hand foot mouth disease (no offense joey my queeeeen!) so yeah they need to stop blowing up
LOGAN IS A GOOD Person

What. R u doing Logan!
*plz no hate, this is my opinion*  Fuck logan, i don't like him
u gis cant bo this logan is a good person
I forgot this guy even exist
I always hated Logan paul and Jake Paul. they're terrible influences on children
stop judging him he didn't know i'm not a big fan of him I know he's a good guy
My siblings learned bad words from him and he thought them how to be racist
This is just sad
I just realized this. How could he tell the guy's hands were purple if he didn't have his colorblind glasses on?
AARON PAUL IS FUCKING BEAST
Wow a great way to start the year
I'm sorry Logan
Shut up every one he made a mists give him a Barack he makes more than you will ever make plus he is sorry for what he did
#FakeNews
I don't get why the video was bad
He is not a bad guy y'all should forgive him
"15 million followers on YouTube" wtf
All those kids and teens that watch him, don't even see that this dead-body-scandal is just the tip of the iceberg. The videos I saw included faking his own death infront of children, being utterly disrespectul in one of the most respectful countries in the world and showing off really questionable moral values to people that are just too young to know better. It's not just about this one "mistake". This boy would do literally anything for money and views. And it makes me so mad, that he doesn't even care that he has kind of a role model function.
Hit the nail on the head. Its scary that so many young kids watch him and aspire to be like him
Yet he does horrible shit like this. He isnt a role model hes an immature and inconsiderate idiot.
Spot on...bravo:)
fake overated It's not my priority to be 'cool', that's the difference
hahahahahaha hes cooler then you thats why you crying
Oh my god..
wow Logan u just wanted more subs
Franak Boateng no he didn't all people take situations like that differently. I feel like people just needed an excuse to hate on him. Just give him a break he has been taking a break on the thing he loves most vlogging all because of that video. He clearly feels sorry for what he did can't u guys just give him a break?
Franak Boateng no he didn't
Franak Boateng and I'm one of them
Franak Boateng now because he has enough 
Evelyn shut the hell up, Logan was disrespectful to an ENTIRE country, did you not watch his videos in Japan? He's a disgrace and should get his ass kicked for mocking all those people and harassing them the way he did. He'll get more than a reality check you better believe that.
This fool had to show his cockiness in his apology letter. DISGUSTANG!
AIIIIII LOGEN
I am no Logan Paul's fan but I think somebody ought to punch him on the nose.
FUCK YOU
HOW DARE U TALK ABOUT LOGAN PAUL LIKE THAT
Dude its old news leave him the fuck alone
Poor Sayori... If only Monika was Stopped.
Come on he never seen a dead body befor
Stop be bad with Logan he has a heart like us
I formgiven you Logan
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo logan!!
There is actuly a petition that's trying to delete his channel 512,718 have signed it 
That's sad
Gerrit First off, it's good cause he's a fucking idiot and makes humanity an actual pity, second off he deserves it.
Liam Serrie Youtube actually cut business ties with him.
Where can I sign?!?!?!?
Alfred Lord He gave the link it's right up there in the comments
Gerrit where i need to sign!
Fuck you guys
We are raising sociopaths by the millions.
I know Logan Paul didn't  know he was going to find a dead body, it was not planned  it's not his fault
Fuck the haters
Fuck you logan paul go the hell
You are so over reacting. He said that he is so sorry so enough
What happened about Logan??
Please just forgive him and millions will be happy
I don't  know what to say because my cousins are like the logang or something I'm not blaming logan because I've seen the video but he has never seen a dead body he said in his video
This is Logan I didnt do it for views. I get views. Way to tell people you got views
This is the worst year ever!  I love Logan he makes everyday feel amazing. Thank you for ruining my birthday and year haters.

Where is logan paul he has noy done any videis in 2 eeeks
Lo-gang!!!!
Says he has 15M followers on youtube.
Do you even YouTube though
Josephine Judah Baht Israel he apparently does
Just except his apology for god sake
Logan wasn't raising awareness  until ppl started hating and losing subs then he starts apologizing about it to get more how pathetic
Prevention? How can you 'prevent' suicide by laughing at a dead body?
Still waiting for another video from our Logan 
He should bring awareness to suicide by hanging himself and posting it online
in my mind, i was expecting him to hit the body like a pinata
Why did you do thiss
Logang 4 life and I will do anything for Logan to stay on YouTube because if it werent for logan I wouldnt be who I am because Logan is my hero so logang we should forgive Logan and not get him fired like jake when he was on disney so logang 4 life and #beamaverick
just for attention you selfish ugly human
fuck ligen paul
"15 million followers on YouTube" omg jeez
Yasss this is what 2018 needs. This cunt needs to lose all his fans and rights on YouTube!!
WoW he has a name
Reality check? Whoa whoa whoa thats Dr Disrespect tagline
Fuck Logan Paul I always hate him
Best way to start 2018 :(
Never heard of the guy before this.  He looks and sounds like a bore.
He's a spoiled brat who thinks he can get away with anything. Maybe he needs to loose his channel so he'll grow up.
yet other countries show burnt bodies and dead car crash victims on their nightly news every night and not one complaint received  ? this is just more US hypocrites news ...
And the award for "Missing the point entirely" goes to...
Alright people have already forgiven him so who cares anymore look at his comments in the apology video
Read any of the Japanese comments literally telling him to fuck off and never return.
this is not even news worthy. I'm telling you right now this world will fall. it's pathetic.
Yeah Logan has 50 million FOLLOWERS
All you guys are really dumb because I forgive Logan Paul because where goes all his good videos and all his subscribers what do you guys think.  I once again forgive him  yes I know that the video was really graphic but he said that at the beginning of the video and I was kinda scared about seeing the body but it is what it is like I said  I FORGIVE YOU LOGAN PAUL  ps. Jake Paul has done some stupid stuff and all u Jake Paulers  stood up for him why cant we stand up for Logan welp Im going to go.     Ps. Logan if you see this can you put it in your video please and thank you Im YOUR #1 super fan ... peace 
youtube you must ban logan paul. his video was also posted on youtube kids
Fuck you guys youtube will go to the ground with out logan

Every time famous people do stupid shit then get on social media or tv and spout off an apology, I have to laugh. Because its always fake and forced, youre sorry now only because youve been caught and lambasted.

poor logan
We need chad
The BEST way to start the new year peeps! 
Before : 15 Mil
Now : 4 million sad subs
it's one thing to do it and realize you messed up and not upload but to choose to post the video shows intentional lack of any decent morals . not sure how he or any can justify ...
he has 15 million followers on youtube.....
Logan is a stupid sick fuck! Asshole!!
Fuck logan Paul

LemonJuiceGV Ay Least Spell Followers Correctly dude.

He really ended his career
CAN YOU ALL PLZ FORGIVE HIM
Why why why why stop forgive him plz he said he was sorry
Wow he really is the most hated guy alive
BOIIIII My Logan is still good Pls don't start 2018 like this PLSS
Logan you should go over night in the suicide forest with me and sees what happens.
Fuck you
He didnt No Da Wae what a shame
Brady Brady u have to have ebola
Sienna Solis pls shut da fk up we r fking right and u not
Yes bruddah
Brady Brady da wae
Brady Brady we must spit on jaeek pawhl
They are making him seem like a criminal but he's not he ment no harm you people should think that maybe he went in there not expecting to to fined one or maybe he's traumatized. I've had loved ones die before I've been to funerals that where open casket and people filmed and people go to that forest to commit suicide which is only done for a reason which was probably caused at home so the persons he killed them self's family should invest in a I don't know investigator to look it the the death and maybe not just use it to fuck up some ones life or maybe use it to help some other potentially suicidal people just saying there is a place called suicide forest where u live maybe before this use the money to have it searched in Stead of suing somebody that meant no harm
yeah logans the best
Alexis Meoak aJust shut up kid
"u don't like it fucck off".. haha.. make me bitch.
itsjustwoods ?! Exactly that's why everyone is saying it's the end for the brothers
Alexis Meoak nah Logan supporters only reason u say that is because ur subscribed to him and watch his vids I have no problem with him but he did wrong he showed a body a DEAD BODY u kids don't understand the word RESPECT it's just not right so he deserved this and then he puts a video saying I'm sorry REALLY?? after laughing and says WTF and OH THAT'S FUCKED UP really??? Ha I have to much more to say but that's whatever
Of course older people don't know how to say subscribers.
He made fun of the body like thats so stupid
U know he blocked out the dead guy  I know this cause I sub to him and he did say in the video that if any one that subs to him or they know someone who is thinking about suicide to get help
Get off your moral high ground
This man right here didnt make the biggest mistake in the world. Go on youtube and you can find horrific content and youre mad about what he did??? Ive seen things that scarred me on YT NOT THIS. He did it with good intentions! The only people hating are people who didnt watch him in the first place. If we put a camera on your life we would see that you do way worse things than Logan has ever done. You want to crucify because the media and influencers tell you too because if you saw it by yourself you wouldnt care! Now the H&M thing is what is popular and also the Shane Dawson thing!!! Wow can you ever give it a break!!! Im releasing this UNFINISHED SONG because I mention Logan and YES I STILL SUPPORT him hes positive and provides a lot of value, you HATERS!! If you had fame how would you like it if people always wanted to take you out??
https://soundcloud.com/kenwhippin/logandidntdoanythingthatdeservesallthishateyoualljustwanttohoponthenextthingtohateon
Leave him alone he already apologized
ABC NEWS IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE!!!!! GOD STOP
A mistake? You're a fool to think that he did this as a mistake.  He wasn't on  LIVE feed! He took the time to film.. Edit.. and post the video to a bunch of brainwashed kids and laughed at this man's suicide... Then after he got back lash... He decided to cover it up by saying he wanted to show awareness?  He has no respect and all he has running through his eyes is money! And you little twats think it's ok and defend him?  You all are screwed if you honestly think this guy uploaded this as a mistake.. he did it without caring or having morals. Wake up little sheeple!!!
Jay Baker ur a mistake why did u have to come to this world..
No it wasn't. He knowingly put that video on youtube after knowing what he filmed.
How is that stupid laugh a mistake???? ..completely disrespectful, inappropriate and disgusting! You are deluded!
Jay Baker stfu
ABC News you guys are putting him down ,mind ur own business
slime vlog, i don't think you understand what Logan did, he disrespected a whole country and someone's dead body. His "apology video doesn't exactly get him forgiven by anyone, it was a trash apology, and you can't just forgive someone who did what he did.
DAKOTA z so no one was affected by this? No kids cried about the thought of suicide? No kids cried because the saw a dead body? No parents were upset because their kids were crying? No one was offended because they have or are having a problem dealing with suicide and anything related? No family members and the VICTIM were disrespected?? I could go ON and ON about how many people this affected...
Fucking shut up he did nothing wrong bitches
Can I just add fucking to that
Yes fucking yes
I thought that U were NICE but its A big FAT NO
Did fucking Logan fucking Paul give you permission to use this I hate him for this but ducking still
who is offended when they see a dead human body?? its nothing but a limp human, how dumb
For all the logan paul fans out there, your idol is no more.
1:50 Yeah sure Logan, yeah sure.
Stop hating on Logan he did not know what to do he was scared and confused so just drop it and make him come back
LOGANG FOR LIFE
Aaron Paul FUCK YOU
How can logan be immune to the curse of the japanese suicide forrest...
Back off ok he made a mistake
you and your brother are the best youtubers
yall aught to b stupid for believing ths mofo. evn more stupid tht these anchors dont evn c how damaging an moronic these ppl can b yet yall still support ths crap
you are a sagvage logan
Half of the people that watched the video then freaked out about him filming a dead body cant read.
Kiss my but YouTube
Look he didn't mean to and sure what he did was wrong but grow the hell up people its a dead body also sure it is somebody that was loved but u see he made his own choice to do that. And plus how would u react to a dead body we all react differently and he didn't know that there was a dead body. LOGAN PAUL RULES
Dalton Mosley DAKOTA z so no one was affected by this? No kids cried about the thought of suicide? No kids cried because the saw a dead body? No parents were upset because their kids were crying? No one was offended because they have or are having a problem dealing with suicide and anything related? No family members and the VICTIM were disrespected?? I could go ON and ON about how many people this affected...
If I'm going to be honest, people are right. Just like a few people said. He knowingly filmed and was allowed to post the video. Like ya sure you made the video but you should see the mistake and shouldn't even try to post it man. Logan you really screwed up this time around.
Dalton Mosley no one believes you.
But he KNOWINGLY posted it to youtube after knowing what he filmed. He chose to post it. He chose to show it. He gets what he deserved. You need to do some growing up and have a serious think about life.
I dont think anyone laughs at a dead body
I never watched Logan Paul but after hearing this? Holy Jesus
One chans
If y'all make Logan quit youtube then f you
Leave him alone he is young
I think that anyone can make a mistake. This video was really in poor taste and VERY SAD and disturbing. However we have to remember that his fans are always expecting more and more drama from him and other you-tube bloggers. I believe he was not thinking when he and his team ( lets remember Logan is just the face) made the decision to post this. There was a camera man and several other people there that could have said to Logan that this was disrespectful and not a good idea to post. Did any of them do that? NO,NO, NO. Not one. He made a VERY VERY BAD decision to post this, but he was not alone. Come on people, lets have some mercy. Logan is not a MONSTER. He made a bad decision. He should not be punished by himself for this. There were other people involved. Because of the pressure, rejection, loneliness depression etc  that people feel is the reason for the  suicide forest being there in the first place. The other people involved in this video should come forward to share some of the weight Loganis feeling. And we as a society should be more forgiving of a very young Emphasis on VERY YOUNG man and let this go. He has faced enough already. He is pretty much destroyed so what else do we want?  Stop the hate.
.......logan
STFU everyone needs to chill, it happened last year.
No. Why did he do that
he felt bad stop being so fucking rude to Logan he may have laughed about it but why do u this j he posted a video saying he is sorry dumbass
Srew logan paul
Ty Marsh ..?
you suck he didnt mean it
Omg this is stupid! Logan Paul clearly said that he found a dead body! So if kids didn't want to see a dead body why did they watch it! He isn't going to say I found a dead body when he found a unicorn or a tree or whatever......plus if a little kid had found the body they would have freaked out! So he did a good thing for some people why can't we just give Logan Paul a second chance like spew do with loads of over people who make mistakes...doesn't Logan Paul count? Yes it was a bad thing to post but he did give warning 
The fact that he left the body in the fucking video is reason enough to bash him. He used a person's death for views, and you have the audacity to call it 'a mistake'? It wasn't a fucking mistake, it was a choice.
x_gracesmith_x js HE STILL SHOUDINT SHOW IT IDIOT
The reason people are outraged was because of his reaction to the taken life. He laughed. He laughed at someone taking their own life.
x_gracesmith_x js take your unicorn ass bitch back to 5th grade. youre not ready for the world yet.
Please wake up
good way to start 2018
Fuck Logan Paul
Not cool logan
He didn't recently comment suicide the dude he showed to the world there's no real evidence that he committed suicide on the close by days/years
They should have deleted his channel
No thats too far
Grete Alavere logan is not a bad person. Hes just plain stupid and overall narcissistic and antisocial with hiis behavior!
Yeah shut up
I do not like you making fun of him
And you're a hypocrite  Ivan... No one was making fun of anyone except for Paul Logan and his goons!   Wake up!!!
Logan paul is an idiot, and didn't deserve the subs he had, nor did he deserve his money.
Well we don't like him making fun of other countries.
if I subscribed to Logan Paul I would've already unsubscribed by now... but I was smart from the beginning.i can't stand any of the Paul brothers and I never will. that video and that YouTuber are disgusting, I can't stand prideful, pathetic, idiots. how did they even get That famous? honestly, I could find more humor in a garbage disposal... the problem isn't only one of the Paul brothers, it's both. I can't stand Logan, his brother, or team 10...  #Nogang
manic mouse77 i already have one.And its better than yours
#getalifeyouretard
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT SO SHUT UP PEOPLE
"I know you are but what am I" is not the best way to argue you're capable of handling a mature discussion. You're a kid that clearly doesn't understand the issue, so stop pretending like you do.
AA610 WELL YOU ARE
If you post a comment in a public place, don't be surprised when people call you out on your stupidity.
Edgy 10 year old that's never left his home country confirmed.
AA610 WAS I TALKING TO YOU NO SO GET OUT MY BUSINESS AND LEAVE LOGAN LAUL ALONE AND DONT LIE HE DID NOT HARRS HOW EVER YOU SPELL IT BTW SHUT THE FUCK UP
No No no you giving him VIEW STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!
15 million *followers?* I thought it was subscribers.
Logan is   pooooopooooo
I'm a maverick no matter what so this I'm still part of the logang :3
remember jake went through the same
U the fuck people he didn't know he ll found a dead body
Didn't know who this guy is until now and to be honest he look very stupid and unfunny.
subscribers ffs.. not followers. when are those news guys going to understand this?
HE NEEDS TO COME BACK
oh no
leave him alone
a bro its logan hes good
"Why 2017 was the best year of my life" And how "2018 has already started terrible for me" ;-)
They are not laughing at the dead guy they are laughing at the bizarre situation. He goes on to tell people that are struggling with depression to stay strong.
I don't understand the desire people have with trying to ruin this guys reputation. Logan is an inspiration to millions of young kids. He's no Magellan, but at least he has some good characteristics that are probably rubbing off on his followers. He appears to have great oral hygiene and a chizzled bod. That means he has self disciplined which is exactly what our our youth needs.
While his next video shows him harassing random people in Shinjuku? Sure, what a role model...
I can confirm that most of his subs are demented 6th graders from expirence
It isint a b c newse business
IT WASENT LOGANS FAULT
Just shut the fuck up. This isn't a big deal it's not his fault that he vloged with a dead body so shut the fuck up bitches.
Nathan Glockner Ahem. Nobody forced him to go to the woods. Nobody made him carry on vlogging. He was not forced to go near the body. He was not held at gunpoint to click the upload button. It is 100% his damn fault!
Arizona State University is full of these dickheads
stupid ass white boy
just give logan anothe chance he is the best of the best youtuber i ever seen
#PEOPLEHATERS he said he was sorry
We all need to pray for Logan Paul. The Bible says that everyone makes mistakes. The whole world hates him because he did one mistake.Nobody is perfect nobody needs to act like they are perfect.We are praying for Logan
Presley Chan   *s a m e*
Henry Powell "mistakes" *A DEAD BODY ISNT A MISTAKE*
Agree but im not religious so
Yes, he made a mistake, and that means he should be held accountable. Remember how your precious bible talks about sin and how you go in purgatory to repay your sins, well little Logan here needs to go to purgatory for a lot of things.
Too bad I'm an athiest, what an *absolute fucking shame*
Fuck this shit we want Logan back!
He makes to mistakes!! Wow people he learns from it and he sad he was srry
IF this was a mistake then why did consult this with his editor before uploading it and DECIDING that it was a good Idea to put this on a kid friendly channel. This is why anything said by a Jake Pauler/Logang member can be shown that they are wrong on many different levels
Isabelle 2004 Oh my god. WAKE UP! He made fun of suicide and laughed someone who took their life!!
Isabelle 2004 
And I called you a kid because you obviously are one. Once you're my age you'll realize what a mistake it is to defend people like him.
Isabelle 2004 
It wasn't a mistake. It was a choice.
why kid?
He's always seemed like a piece of shit to me, but i could never tell why. This shows mw why i felt like that about him.
FUCK LOGAN
AYYYYYYYYYY
I am Japanese who is living in Tokyo. We want to say strongly that we forbid him to visit in Japan again. We were shocked by his stupidity. We can not tolerate his behavior and  wish to give him punishment from US embassy.  We confirmed again that American is noisy and get annoyed as national personality.
kelly wine    *b l e s s*
I am real Japanese who can speak English. I'm sure English native speaker like you is single cell and imbecile,isn't it?. Your comment is infantile too much.
Zeph what kinda crack you on
Vartilak Novehestum I'm sure you're not even old enough to drink beer if you support Logan for his actions.
This is the most racist ass thing I saw,.
oh no.....they just want views and money UGH....
Oh loagan fucked up
OMG my kid are watching this guy . This it not good
xXNyanicornXx Gaming so?You think the entire world speaks English as their first language?
He made one mistake doesnt mean you have to hate on him on him so shut up
He deleted the video.
FlowerMint shut the fuck up they're probably from a different country, shows how smart YOU are.
Arianator Grande yes right . the news tell it all
I intended to raise awareness.. how do you raise awareness about suicide while you make jokes about it and film someone who took their own life
You don't get followers on YouTube you get subs
that fake ass apology 
Nicholas Okonneh sorry I wasn't asking you
Dani van de Nieuwenhof just fucking hang yourself you toxic fuck.
lol he is not uploading this is your best chance to not be brainwashed
Jayda Morgan oh shut up
??????he cried? i mean like a real one
I'm looking at all the comments of the video and they are hella nasty.  Jake Paul did bad.  The only people supporting him now are people who think he can do know wrong.  Nothing wrong with that,  but I think Logan Paul did a terrible thing.  And these 12 year olds saying that he did nothing wrong and saying they only kids well guess what: I'm 12 too.  And what Logan did was very disrespectful to Japan.  Now go eat a snickers.
Logan.   Do    not.    Go   there
1:20 well that was before he saw the dead body.
Im in logang but if he ends his carreer ima jump out dat window
Hope this fucker gets removed
He is just an idiot! He has no brain, no respect!
OMG I'm scared
Everyone makes mistakes duhhh
So this isn't a gag... He's actually famous?
Stop talking about logan
Logan Paul made 2018 so stupid!
Thats it Logan no longer exists to me
that's hot
I never even watched the Paul's before this. Not going to start.  But I can't watch the original video to know exactly what happened.
Am I the only one does like Logan Paul, but also doesnt think its such a big deal what he did?
Probably because you're a kid that doesn't understand the ramifications of what he was doing.
Its called subscribers not followers. #smartass
f**k you haters that hate on logan paul because i am a f**king mavrik
I was mad and Logan but I accept his apologie
Save Logan Paul
Don't ever edit or censor yourself based upon what others or the media say.
i Dont think children should be subjected to death, especially the type of children that watch his videos. Im fucking 14 and just recently my grandfather showed me his penis, he most likely has mental issues and had experienced a tragic family death but when I brought it up that I didnt like it, he got completely mad at me and said I should be able to look at it. Whenever I have to 
go near him Im still a little uncomfortable. So if Im traumatized of s a penis when Im 14, imagine what a 4 year old would think of being shown the hand of a corpse. When I was 4, I was scared of the fucking toilet exploding
Sadly factsstraigt, many countries have these same laws, including America. In business, many industries force their workers to dye their hair to give out a better outlook. My dad needed to dye his hair as well to make it look less grey, does this mean that the industry is totalitarian or fascist? Hell no! Its fucking buisness. I wont get into corruptness of the law much but believe me, that happens a shit ton in America. And the law against filming dead bodies isnt just about how disrespectful it is to the families, because I see you could care less, if is also likely because any evidence that may have been filmed, like that bag or the hand, should have REALLY been turned into the police. As any possible future investigation against any person, they would need anything they could, and considering the Japanese court system is more akin to a Phoenix Wright game, where evidence can be hidden from the court and brought up when neeeded most, if the corpse was actually a murdered corpse, lgan paul would be in even deeper trouble. Im almost sure theres a law in America that makes it illegal to film unidentified dead bodies and upload it to YouTube,  but if not, it could very well be considered tampering with evidence. Im not sure if Europe is similar to America and Japan in the way that they have, like, laws for court. But seeing that they allow nude people to walk on the beach, I wouldnt be surprised if their laws were a little less similar.
Well, i can agree to disagree on wether what Logan Paul di was a bad thing, but he aint doing shit to bring attention to suicide. All he did was go to a forest literally known as suicide forest and filming a dead body and then saying he did it to bring attention to suicide. People talk about finding dead bodies in suicide forest a lot, all he did was show it.
I stated the point that everybody is different, I just found it odd how he reacts to things thats all
Sadly I have never seen the video itself, so I have no clue wether its recent or 1945. Or in Poland... my point is, a country can give permission to another country, as well as to itself to do things on its own grounds. Bale Paul cannot give himself permission nor did he get permission from authorities. You seem to kind of be missing the main point. But my main issue is how illegal it was of him to do this. Weve established that we have different morals already.
Rip Logan paul
It make you hate Logan Paul
I stopped posting videos i NEED him to come back i know what he did was wrong but we all make mistakes some BIG and some small but he feels really bad he has NEVER missed a day of vloging i just saying i need him back i hurt to watch his apology video hes not expecting to be forgiven ether just stop craping on him he knows he was wrong......
Lord BloodCrimson sad truth! Only they wont get famous but would land in jail!
What makes Logan Paul worse is that some young kids look up to him and will probably grow up imitating him.
People who are entertained by his stupidity, rudeness, and lack of awareness and decency are people with mental problems! Logan clearly is antisocial and narcissistic!
Could be worse. He could have filmed himself beating up a homeless man.
Emma Whitmore normal people can get away with 1 2 3 mistakes Paul's can make 172763646478181636464647382910103746645463628199273746463627273 and it's ok that's fair
Thats bullshit. Logan said that he would post the video for a positive ripple. Whats fucking positive of a dead body? You should just cut that part out and then tell the police. 
*raises awareness for suicide by laughing at a man who died via suicide*
how did he find the logic in that?????
He should be banned from the internet
Yup. Logan Paul is officially over.
I miss Logan Paul
Do you crazy we all know that body was kind a real I know you love use my bro that's just want your kind of weird but I like your videos and all but don't do that that's just wrong to video aboutbut also you should prank Lucas Marcus and dairy so sorry the Doobie Brothers jake Paul knows on your brother and that's kind of weird making funny your brother when he already said sorry so it's going to make more videos OK OK no musical bye-bye
Wow. Punctuation and proper grammar needed.
Jack Jack Vlogs Ever went to school?
Jack Jack Vlogs learn to break down sentences.
I watch logan paul but I never seen this but I seen some clip and I'm shocked
Go again and do suited
Wow I feel so bad
I love Logan Paul 
so did he quit blogging cuz he did not post fitva week? (ok ok bad timing for this comment)  BUT PLZ,TELL ME
I meant Pewdiepie. Thx
Hes a bad influence
0:35 omg there called fucking Taco Bells not followers
Forgive him he just did one dumb ass thing he just made one mistake it absolutely was just a growing up experience.
Because it's not a mistake to be disrespectful in a serious situation, record it, edit it, upload it, and then continue with another video like nothing happened while showcasing the exact same awful behavior. It's a series of conscious, and extremely stupid, decisions.
How do you really know whether or not he knew what he was Doing? where's your proof?
cool stuff 306 it wasn't a mistake if he knew what he was doing.
Keemstars plan worked
Oh Logan was wrong tfil went into suicide forest and found a dead body
Logan made a really really bad mistake but that doesn't mean he should never be forgiven. When he found the body, it appeared that he was just laughing at it, and it's pretty true that it was just his way of coping with it. It definitely wasn't a good way, but this isn't something he needs to be drilled for. He obviously had his mind on YouTube in the moment and made a very selfish decision. we all have our pro's and con's to ourself, and if you were out on YouTube, and were really famous, I'm sure you would make plenty of mistakes too, and it doesn't have to specifically just be this situation. He shouldn't be public enemy #1. When the time is right he should come back to YouTube and move on. Is it really the end of the world? and yes, I understand he made a very bad decision but you know you you can make many terrible mistakes too. Also, as you could tell, in the video he made, this one was really different than his others. He was trying to spread awareness for suicide and help. Sure,  it was a little cheesy, but he wasn't trying to purposely do anything wrong or mean. You all need to open your eyes and move on. What is going to happen if we keep looking back on this? NOTHING! You can't move on to the next chapter if you keep re-reading the last. He is under so much fire I wouldn't be surprised if he killed himself. Seriously guys, settle down and stop hating, he is human.
I didnt do it for the views, I get views how could you say that?
Ugh. I hate the Paul siblings, especially Logan.
Jayden reid 976 boss Hey Hey Stop Disrespecting Her It was Just a Opinion You Can Just Keep it to Yourself Every one has a Right of Speech What would You do if You Were Whacked by a Stick while Speaking out your opinions
I like Logan dummy idiot
They're not called followers they are subscribers idiot
Hes still a millionaire, I forgive him. Life goes on
he asked for people to buy his merch  in his apology
Sophie Turner says she hopes that Logan doesnt commit suicide... but Aaron Paul says to rot in hell.... WTF
I told my Mom and Dad about this, they were angry. And the funny thing, My sisters watch him, TRIGGERED
Hey, guess what! The news media shows worse!
I don't like either of the Pauls but don't send him death threats for this.It would be a tragedy for him to kill himself,never wish death upon anyone!I understand that he did fuck up and how it's completely disrespectful to laugh and take this as a joke but still no one deserves a punishment a severe as death.
Sophie SHUT IT OK LOGAN PAUL IS A GOOD PERON HE EVEN SAID SORRY UR SUCH A DUMB HEAD
Raise awareness he laughed in the video
15Million Followers Lmao
I don't understand why he did this
He don fucked up! 
Ok can everyone just ban him
It's every day brooooooo

So stupid
Logan Paul is a Illuminati clown! It should of been you hanging from that tree.... you idiot!!!
pewdiepie has 57 million
"Followers" uhh normies
how could this kid have been making youtube Videos since he was 10? Youtube was barely a thing ten years ago as it started in 2005 as we know it now....
Don't be sad it's okay
Who Cares
Another disgusting American kid who has no morals, respect, or compasion towards anyone even the death smh
Logan Paul posted the video on Snapchat

I hate Logan Paul right now
Logan paul gives me cancer 
Who the fuck watches that shit?
Well his 2018s great! 
Aaron Paul is wrong. Logan Paul is not trash, he's the whole garbage truck
He didnt mean it, these ppl dont have lives talking trash on YouTube 1000s of ppl
But he posted it after he knew what he filmed. So he did mean it.
Kier Carley pretty sure he meant it. All of them are adults, and they went out of their way to find one. I heard they even went out of the usual path. And he did more than just this video. The thing is, youre a visitor, always be respectful of the people, their country and their culture
fucking idiot
He don't respect dead body don't respect japan."When in Rome, do as the Romans do"I
 present for him it's common sense right? japan has similar proverb too.I don't care suicide movie because  I think that he is youtube  produced psychopath.most of japan people annoyed his  bad behavior in japan.
He's a really ignorant human being. So sad.
can yall not??? do u think logan had time to say omg there is a body do u think i would get in trouble if i wear to show him hmmm will i be breaking rules? please cut him some slack and leave him alone
/me hello

THE ACTION DOES NOT ADD UP TO HIS DISGUSTING ACTIONS...QUIT TRYING TO SHOVE THIS UNDER THE CARPET FOR HIS (PAUL), AND YOUR GREED!! THE DISGUSTING SHOW OF LACK OF HUMANITY BY BOTH IS BEYOND WORDS...THE ONLY WAY YOU FIX THIS IS TO REMOVE HIM FROM YOUTUBE "DESPITE" HIS 15 MILLION VIEWERS...THAT PERSON DESERVES  JUSTICE IN FULL ACTION FOR VIOLATING HIS PRIVACY IN THE MOST INHUMANE WAY IMAGINABLE. FIRE HIM!!!!
I saw the video before it was deleted!!
I hate you logan

I'm a logangster and plz stop talking about this i know it's viral

it is so annoying  that she said followers instead of subscribers
I feel bad for you logan
My mother and I are disappointed in him but we are still logangsters. #LOGANGSTERS4LIFE!!!!!!!!!!
Don't hate you suk he said sorry and yous and all the hatter made he cye
He did not mean it
Obviously he did. He knowingly posted it knowing what he caught on video. He chose to post it.
I cant find this video
Fuck yo shit cnn
Raise awareness for suicide?  I'm pretty sure most people are aware that people kill themselves...
Ok he uploaded a new video saying sorry I forgive him but he should of let the police know its just I forgive
But him back on YouTube I love he is favorite YouTuber
OMG I THOUGHT THAT FOREST WASNT REAL OR ATLEAST PEOPLE DIDNT KILL THERE SELF
They go there because its hard to find them.
My sister is crying in real life
Why the hell did youtube let that video go ahead and get to TRENDING?  why youtube? Why?
Why would he do this this is bad
#LOGANCOMEBACK
If logan was here "MOM I MADE IT"  R.i.p Logan Paul
Abc your stupid
u need to chill its nothing he might banned from youtube if u think its a big deal you dumb
stop hateing if you love logan paul like 1 more logangster on
This jerkoff represents every American kid that longs to be an asshole...and there are millions
Honestly I dont think he did anything wrong
It wasnt a bad thing they didnt know how to act about it
Ive always hated Logan Paul but my mom told me about this and I didnt even know what to say.
hey logang its okay its was a mistake
Logan made a mistake
People make mistakes,
The world makes mistakes,
What's the problem?
Striffee For one, I do not watch Logan paul, Next is if this was an average person who posted a clip like that on snap chat and then apologised it would not go any where near as viral
What's the problem? You're the problem. He was making money off of someone else's misfortune and people like you thought it was funny. He knew exactly what he was doing, that was no mistake.
Hes a grown ass adult, anybody with half a brain and couth should know not to do stupid shit like this. Stop with the excuses.
Right
Alia _6 I totally agree
Hey abc maybe people would think before killing them selfs if they watched it . I seen it liked it learned something more logan paul !!!!
show t he body is the problem? suicide is the problem? this is ironic! when u see everyday this type off things in the television
I like Jake Paul but I don't like Logan paul
there's nothing wrong with that
I least found the body and posted jr because no one would had found out like the policr
Oh yeah
Damn everyone who hates Logan I was crying for 3 hour I hate people
WHY THIS SHIT
Yea he has 15 million compared to 3 million so frock you
Hey guys ! Just need Help to collect 100 subscribers ! ;) Or if you can just PRESS  ! First My Video! ;) If you are interested, my videos are about SUP in Cyprus! We rent boards and inflatables kayaks, and if you go to Cyprus, we are ready to give a discount for any person who are SUBSCRIBED to the Chanel ;) Thanks You So Much! And Welcome to Cyprus :)
WTF is with Americans that even the news anchors are like ''He is making millions of dollars in endorsements.. he drives vehicles worth $250,000..'' Bitch is very impressed but it's not fucking relevant here !!
Logan Paul is a social degenerate nerd who doean't deserve the wealth he has. Much like every other content creator on YT making money (somehow) off of gullible children, inflated view counts and inactive subs. 
He's the perfect example of wht people should NOT get paid for YT videos.
"Allegedly" showing a body?
I watched the video I hoped not to see anything suicide ever again after my uncle, he really needs to grow up loads of people have done it, it might be click bait BUT if it's not, well the person might of died because of what someone did to them the only thing I can think of making people suicidal is bullying and illness
Well...rip Logan.....but will all his subs go to jake?
'He has 15million FOLLOWERS on YouTube............WELL DONE
Fuck u
Keep Logan Paul and don't ban him ban my YouTube channel and about the dead body I bet you would laugh at that to.      Anyway put this on the news
He did nothing wrong
...oh no....
Did he said n the beginning he said little bastard or is it just me?
YouTube tuck him down off youtube
BRING HIM BACK NOW!!!!!
Hes such a brick ?
dpnt you dare delete logan paul his is the best youTuber
says the dude with a roblox profile picture
Who fucking cares Logan Paul is still fucking beast
Dunno y people.follow him.hes a idiot
I completley agree he should be stopped from leaving bad intensions of young kids... BUT no one wants to bash Nicki Minaj?? little girls walking around looking like skanks its disgusting. All these famous people dont care about the youth slowly messing up rich kids live's , like poor kids in a ghetto "thuggin" thinking thats all they can do or (what they should do to fit in) because all rappers constantly talk about "gangbanging" and drugs.  It all goes around in one big circle. These people are shapping our future and its horrible.
1:26 wrong TFIL did it they found two but blurred one out because they never saw the second one but you have to look really close to see it
My brother hung himself He makes me sick laughing at some one thats committed suicide he is vile. Get his channel off youtube
stop bashing Logan he didn't do it for views it was a accident that he found a dead body 
Logan who?
This is not fair wtf was a mistake it wasn't like he did it on  purpose
allegedly? He did post such a video....
Booooooooooooooo
Logan Paul just disgusts me
Here is the uncensored vesion for you guys! http://nimbleinity.com/18762907/loganpauluncensoredfootage
Ive never seen any of his vids in my life... looks like a douche whos not funny
Never heard of him, he already looks annoying.
fuck Logan Paul
Omg  he said he was sorry and yall are still sleeping on it.
This wouldnt have happend if the guy didnt commit suicide in the forest n if logan didnt upload the vid...
Logan is a bat excuse as a human being and he's not even human any more goes a fat mean pig who shows kids dead bodies and the man poor family Logan should be a shame off him self And he even made up jokes about it he's a terrible person
#logang4life
Asshole logan paul you dickshit
guys nothing was his foult
STOP BEING MEAN TO LOGAN PAUL HE DID POST THAT BUT HE LAUGHED AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE HE DIDNT THINK HE WAS ACTUALLY GONNA SEE A DEAD BODY
Okay but why did he post the video? WHY DID HE LEAVE A DEAD FUCKING BODY IN THE VIDEO!? Why didn't he edit it out? That person had a family and a life, and Logan plastered them onto his thumbnail to attract views. Stop defending his actions.
Anzack The minute the beginning of the video he said what forest he was going into, people should've already expected the worse. But getting mad at him for his behavior is sad, because many people would've reacted the same way.
He just visited a place called the *SUICIDE* forest, what do you expect?
ZEAZ riddle Exactly. He wasn't mocking the body, he was fuckin shocked to actually come across one.
"I did it to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention" bro, u made fun of a dead corpse and call it prevention for suicide.
I still like Logan paul
I still like log an paul
I still love log an Paul's  vlogs stop talking about him
I still love log an Paul's v vlogs stop talking about him
I still love log an Paul's v vlogs stop talking about him
really stupid maniac
*Kong
Just understand him GRANDPAS and GRANDMAS!
I'm Depressed And I want Long Curse you YouTube and  The News
fuck all haters
It's a ok Logan because you didn't now
We all have seen way worse on TV news and cable!  What he did was make a dumb ass mistake and a poor judgement call.  We have all done this at some point in our lives, some worse, some not.  What about all the child porn that gets passed around, why don't we hear anything about that? Or people getting punished for that? But Logan's video has caused this much talk in the news and online?  WTF for? I feel very bad for the family of the victim, but have any of you been face to face with a dead body?  Maybe they panicked, maybe they got nervous, maybe they just simply messed up!   Logan never should of posted the video, but he did it's over and the way people are reacting is very sad to me.  Why don't you go after someone that deserves it, like child predators, or people that post actual killings on line, cyber bullies, etc. I don't think this kid deserves to have this happen to him, You Tube and all of you should give him a second chance.  We all deserve one, if this was you or your son, wouldn't you want the same?
Trash trash trash
Y'all just mad bc he mead a mistake y'all did it be for your kids do it to
Get your shit right
Kick him off YouTube!!!!!
ABC is not making money off this.. FU AND FU
Now your making money onreporting SUICIDE so YOU TOO FEEL SHAME!!!! DONATE ABC TOhttps://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/donate/ Ill never watch ABC again! LOGAN YOU TOO DONATE YOUR EMPIRE TOhttps://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/donate/ OR GET OFF YOUTUBE.
It might not be his fault bc some people start laughing when they get scared so yall can stop
Shame on Paul Logan!! A brat!! Ban him!! He is not sorry!! He don't want to lose his money!! Boycott his videos and the people who pay him
Fuck you 
you guys don't have fucking shit 3.1 million subscribers
he has 15 million subscribers biches
The pathetic part is the fact that he apologize a couple times and had to delete his first apologies because they were not actually apologies. They had the mentality of what are you so upset about. This guy is a cancer on society. Personally I have absolutely no idea how a channel that produces such stupid content as his even became popular in the first place but this latest action just solidifies the fact that he clearly has no care for other people and literally only cares about getting views and intern money. I would love to say that this will hurt his career but lets be honest. For someone like him who got popular posting videos for people of low intelligence this will have absolutely no effect
0:49 whats the name of this babe I forgot it
Screw you abc news
Unsubscribed this kid so disrespectful
This is why I follow simplynailogical
Subscribers not followers
*LOGAYS*
15million?? For this idiot?? 
DON'T KICK HIM OF YOUTUBE
Oh no.. no no no 
I hope common US people would feel shame that silly childish this guy educated in your country.
FACK YOU
No Logan is better then you now shut up
Mohammed Alhammadi So Logan Paul Is Better Then Us Because He Lives in People Throwing Stuff as His Windows as He Was Kicked by Youtube and Afraid to Do Anything and Was Kicked off by his Own Clothing Company Because of his Bad Name and Then His Friends are Mad at him and Being Guarded 24 Hours and Afraid to Go Outside without getting Hate by Every Celebrity like the Guy from Breaking Bad...So that's Better?
He is "mucho brokeno"
I recognize that guy .....
Welp his fame turned
what an idiot!
Fpr Fuck Sake Logan
Top entertainment around the world How
YouTube sends vloggers all around the world for free 7 days a week so they can vlog content YouTube sent them around the world to get so at the end of the day was he on yet another YouTube freebie when he recorded this fotage if he was then YouTube sent him there in the 1st place which is probably why YouTube took so long to react in the 1st place because they most probably paid his air fair and paid for his 5***** HOTEL in the 1st place i only follow 1 vlogger but this vlogger spends every week of the year in a different country every week ALL PAID FOR BY YOUTUBE
There jalous of him about his 15 million followers
I watched the video and while it's not the most entertaining and at some points disrespecting towards the Japanese people I can safely say he doesn't owe anyone an apology for the suicide guy , and anyone that feels that they deserve an apology over that should look in the mirror and work on your own faults before worrying about his. I mean I'd have just told you all to kiss my ass and go back to your safe space.
teletubies r hot 
FUCK THE DEAD!
teletubies r hot 
No apology necessary PERIOD!
Also, this is very illegal, any photos or videos taken of an unidentified corpse or any evidence for that matter should be turned in to the police and not shown to anybody until given permission
Its not the laughter, its the fact that he showed parts of a recently deceased corpse, who probably had a family, to his audience of impressionable, young children, for money and views. I wouldnt allow you to come to my sons murder site and take a picture of his foot so you could show it to your Instagram followers
Bruh. He literally broke Japanese laws by filming a dead person. He is wanted for arrest there. It is not fucking okay to film dead bodies, and it doesn't have a fucking thing to do with 'safe spaces'. Its called 'common fucking decency'.
I hope Logan Paul comes back to youtube
Whos on the internet looking for a website containing the video?
THE JEW'S MEDIA WHORES ARE BACK AT IT AGAIN TAKING A STAB AT FUNNY YOUTUBE VIDEO PRODUCER WHEN THEY HAVE JEW'S MEDIA WHORES IN HOLLYWEIRD PRODUCING THE VERY MOST DISTURBING AND SHOCKING MOVIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND NO ONE MAKES ANY LIGHT OF IT AND ALL THE STAGED SHOOTINGS, DEATHS AND VIOLENCE ALL ACTED OUT FOR THE SILVER SCREEN AND ANY ALL AVAILABLE MEDIA DEVICES AND NO ONE IN THE JEW'S MEDIA EVER GIVES A SHIT ABOUT IT, BUT MAKE ONE ONE FUNNY VIDEO ABOUT A PLACE IN JAPAN NAMED SUICIDE FOREST AND THE FUCKING JEW'S MEDIA WHORES WANT TO CRAWL UP YOUR ASS, AND DIE! WE CAN ONLY HOPE!
AND ONE STUPID DUMBASS BITCH THAT ACTUALLY TOOK THE VIDEO PERSONALLY MUST HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING LIFE AT ALL AND PROBABLY WHY THEIR KID COMMITTED SUICIDE HAVING TO LISTEN TO THIS STUPID DUMBASS BITCH ALL THE TIME.
Like, why does the news care
Hes coming back or shit its going now
I sill love him
This just shows HOW INSANE AMERICANS ARE
This kid has to go, I have felt that way since I just learned about him in a top 10 vid. Now, hopefully we will get rid of this moron, because of this grotesque episode.
hey fuck you, you are the only moron here bitch
yeahriight57 exactly you haven't watched his videos so you don't know him 
LOGANG FOR LIFE
He should be banned from youtube and be banned from visiting other countries. Try doing that in the middle east lets see how brave he would be!
Your the one who is the moron here STOP CYBER BULLYING HIM!
yeahriight57 your a fucking moron if your gonna hate on u got to know him first he has 15 million fucking subscriber's and you think your one comment gonna make him go away
I don't see where he did anything wrong. It's not like he went up to the body and took close up shots of it. It's not like he took video of them doing disrespectful things to the body. Logan, no matter how stupid he acts had good intention and probably could've saved some peoples lives by offering to be there for anyone that was thinking of doing self harm like he did. People are way to sensitive these days, and make something out of the nothings, and then leave the somethings alone. This world is so screwed up, and it makes less and less sense to me with each passing day.
I lost my best friend 2 weeks before Christmas to suicide. I never would've dreamed he would've done what they said he done. I still don't believe it. I would give anything if he would've spoken to me about whatever it was that was bothering him so much that he felt like that was his only way out. 
A permanent fix to a temporary problem is suicide. That is what suicide is! You can always find someone that cares to hear what is going on in your life that is so bad. I care! I don't have to know you for you to speak to me. I'm a great listener. My best friend knew this, yet he "chose" to keep it all to himself, and that's wrong choice to make. Talk to someone! You don't have to know them to talk. It's better than taking your on life.
One of the most popular stars on YouTube HA! He wished
iF ANYONE WATCHED IT HE EVEN STATED THAT IT WAS REALLY MESSED UP AND HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT
I will never understand how loners are his followers. stupid people makes any moron a star for no reason.and i never found any of his video funny but people thinks hes funny. poor people with no sense of funny.
And I dont mean it about hating you
Screw you ABC NEWS WE LOVE LOGAN
We got a gold digger
tell me were he said the jokes because i dont see anything
#Fuck the news
Thecnicly its brendens fault for videoing it
Look he made a mistake and now you blame him Lord  #logang 
He does this just for subscribers, he owns this, WAIT WTF AM I SAYING
That's so sad when some Americans have no common decency when it comes to different cultures, it's bad enough when you disrespect people in your own country but travel to other countries and insult their customs just because of your internet fame. Suicide is painful enough to think about but to then be mocked for it on someone's stupid video, way to make yourself and Youtube  look very bad. I hope the families haven't seen that video. Remember commenters I'm entitled to my own opinion, you may not agree with it but I felt I needed to add my two cents it was just so awful that I couldn't leave without saying my piece.
Tanya Goodman I 100% agree w/u..couldn't of said it any better.
I blame japan. How are you gonna let someone enter a restricted area? Assholes
*followers on YouTube*
15 million followers on youtube.
thats impressive
"Apparent"
1 person makes 1 mistake and every one go,s insane when other people do thing way more horrible some how that's mor famous
Logan and jake Paul suck
Stay out of Aokigahara
https://youtu.be/QQrlt1HZx_k must watch i gurrantee u will die laugjing 
Logan Paul made history as the most hated man of 2018
These reporters forgot the part he laughed about the situation at the end of the video about a man who killed himself..
yes you dum arses he a youtube bloger that was live when he walk into it yes he should of had more respect for the man and turn the camera of but  how would you react people acting like he done the viedo there went home uploaded it he was live he a youtube bloger
COME TO STEEMIT.COM  FREE SPEECH is ALIVE and you would MAKE MILLIONS , video what ever you want its a free FLAT EARTH!     Or was the ENTIRE story a HOAX?
he didnt show the body all the liers
Allegedly showing the body. What? *Allegedly* !? Don't downplay it. He did show a dead body.
Fake news
MY FRIEND SAID HE KILLED THAT
YouTube needs to pay and YouTube doesnt need to be our video sharing platform for much longer  if enough people get together to create and support a non bias video sharing platform . YouTube only has power because we give it power by making it the go to .
He has 15 million followers on YouTube.
**facepalm** they arent *followers*, they are *SUBSCRIBERS!*
I watched it full and they said put it on restricted mode on I'm 11 and I watch youtube @abcnews
Sigh...what is this world comming to...
Oh u mint know ur kids are watching this .Men get that out of here .Like my mom nan aunt know all about it and there on my sid a Logan's sid 
I'll take your comment seriously after you actually learn to spell correctly. spend more time studying on english more then losing your brain cells from watching this idiot kiddo
Don't get me wrong I am big Logan Paul but what he did was pretty crappy
Don't Ever talk about Logan Paul like that
Asian Dude who ?
What are you ? Fanboy or fuckboy
Anzack nothing and I'm sorry Japan had to deal with that piece of shit
What can excuse him for all the shit he just did in Japan?
Tasha Rivera fuck Logan Paul and his Fruit loop brother both trash ass scum bags

Why is everyone offended anyway it was a body on a suicide mountain well what did you expect a lolicon??
Noooooo
#wewantlogan
Tornado Gaming #wewantlogandead
#wedontwantlogan
He has to look over the video. He EDITS it. Do you not see how many cuts it has? That doesn't just HAPPEN. That's editing. He's just insensitive and until he's made real actions to redeem himself, such as donating to suicide prevention centers with substantial amounts of money, he does not deserve forgiveness. The fucking "LOGANG" don't seem to see the awfulness behind his actions
Elizabeth Hill delay
Elizabeth Hill !!Why do you speak as if you did not know anything, but you are inflicting your curse on the keyboard?
Im glad I was never a fan .
He's full of shit!
Fuck logan
Please explain why people get their feelings hurt so bad over one dead body like shut the fuck up
POOP HATERS
It makes me cringe how they say followers instead of subscribers
This will blow over and he will get more subs of corse....btw I will probably get a bit of hate from this comment
I hate Logan Paul already vicious makes it way worse
OOF HE DEAD
it was a mistake he didn't think about it, just stop and think would you post that?
Logan pual was the fastest growing YouTube channel on YouTube
fuck u
It's his vlogs like ya spreading the news isnt helping and especially making memes is way worse
Logan Paul Bye Felicia
But I still want to meet him.
I never seen the forest video and that's a good thing.
Stop doing to munch ABC news
Me : you now what you people are haters
shut up Logan Paul
BRUH I LOVE LOGAN
Aaron paul and Sophie turner must be stupid asf
BroBoyGamer why? Cause they called him out on his crap? They are actually both smarter than him. Way smarter
Holy #@$&!!! This is so wrong
ABC Needs to hang themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ywngi3i-0 Like I said go hang yourself with these evil pricks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQe4POfX2s4 Never forget these slim balls!
No shit. Neither lying and deceiving people its also Evil deeds
Jorge Hincapie YAS BITCH SLAYYYYYY
eddiemoses80 suicide is not bullshit dude, its serious as hell. Supporting him for this is basically your approval of him laughing and recording dead bodies. Go hang yourself shitbag
NOBODY FOLLOWS ON YOUTUBE DAMN ABC
Not cool Logan 
Not cool
That's so wrong
Wow jake Paul doesnt care about Logan paul
How could you Logan Paul did not mean to be say sorry but you still !as you are crazy people he is nice
The first apology with emojis and a hashtag for his gang
Well... At least he didn't lie that somebody died like the other lying jackasses
He is not a bad person!/He made a mistake! Everyone does! We're human and WD make mistakes and we are not perfect! I'm sure you made them to. I know I have! God you don't have people down your back when you make a mistake. Just because he is famous doesn't mean he can't make a mistake. God bless! #Logang4Life
Haley Williams that wasn't a mistake if he knew what he was doing. And he's done some pretty dumb things before, but that's definitely the worst
Keep it up guys. You guys are good at explaining things. Not even other news channels cant do the same
Like they said in the video. Its fucked up but this will be a learning experience. I dont like what he did, fact i dont even watch his videos, but a mistake is a mistake, im pretty sure he wouldnt let this happen again and is deeply sorry.
You know what I am so mad who cares he can post whatever he wants
I don't know why you guys judging about him why you can't leave Logan Poe alone
OMG still love you Logan on you did mean to bo that.
You guys need to leave him alone he said he was sorry
Fuck you are harsh
"He has 15M followers on Youtube..."
Me: Subscribers.
"He has 15M followers on Youtube..."
Me: Subscribers.
"He has 15M *followers* on Youtube..."
Me: Subscribers.
He's every where
Bro youre stupid
Fucken dumbass bitch, tf were u thinking dumbass
Logan said he is god damn sorry for this he took it down but Aaron was a ass about it and told him to rot in hell I get what he was trying to say he looked like he was about to cry in the video he is a positive person and tries to make people happy every day by posting videos to make people laugh and make them happy
Gunnar Larson he's not really that sorry, his apology was fake and insincere.
Who say the video I did
It's funny how all the people defending him are 12 year olds.
I was actually thinking about suicide but it's okay I'm alright now
That 200,00 Dollar veachile is called a Lamborghini
did you suck I didn't like it look for us better than this the only 3 million looking for has 250 million losers
You guys ar fucking stupid.
FLIP.
They shut your ass up I mean he has no powers and you and plus it's good to watch him but you just made a mistake and that mistake was bad cuz you know I'm not watching him for a while now so that's what's up b****
Crap fuck fuck fuck SHIT
I'm still in the logang
Also Jake Paul all the rules of Japan,called the name of the video "SUICIDE FOREST'" causing the people that they have spent over 2 God damn decades to come closer with white guys.
Shame on that asshole and I hope that the Japanese people won't let him come back!
Tip for everyone: When u r at a country that they are letting u visiting it FOLLOW THE RULES! , and case u dont know them stop being a stupid (nofence) and ask someone to tell U!
#logangster
top entertainment influencers...never heard of him tbh
I forgive him
Naomi Fegan Ahh Not Me He Made a Ton of Mistake Even One Where He Posted Himself Losing his Virginity with a Picture of Him and a Naked Girl Blerted Out and Him Disrespecting Japan aswell Italy as He Said Italy Doesn't Like American Vloggers and Laughing when Going to a Place Called Suicide Forest
Yes logon fall flat on your face. I knew the day would come when a YouTube will be out of commission.
Why dont these celebrities attack all the murderers in america? This guy is just your typical american.
Peace be with you my son just revert to Islam and all will be good, you will love  life even more and recognise who you are and who created you and everything around you heavens and the earth.Just read the Quran and you will understand life every 1 make mistakes God forgives no problem look at the sky how perfect it is my g
 .....
he has 13m subs now lol
Fuk Logan Paul
Hi, umm did you guys thing about logan pauls reaction? This might be clickbait and you took it on tv i mean you shouldent do somthing like that thats rude!
"He has fifteen million *followers* on YouTube"
LOGAN IS INNOCENT HE KNOWS THAT HE DID SOMETHING WRONG BUT HE IS KIND! And  VERY POLITE HE JUST MADE A REALLY BAD MISTAKE AND I FORGIVE HIM
'Very polite'
He threw a pokeball at a police officar, desecrated a temple, caused a ruckus everywhere he went, harassed people in Shinjuku, and then filmed a dead body, violating several Japanese laws. that's 'polite' to you?
Jay Baker Like How Logan Paul Laugh at the Dead Corpse Like you Did
mikei and I will be laughing
mikei go die
Yoshikazu AnAbeLLe I AGREE I FORGIVE HIM TO!!!
Their was actually kids in my school watching this im one of them and i was going through deppression before this video
I never liked that guy. Seems likes an idiot. Apparently I was right.
Sha Ee Rah  there's no point in calling the cops in the sucide forest because they just leave the dead bodies half of the most of the people that go in there don't intend to commit suicide but I've also done research and the suites forest is actually haunted and that's why they tell people to stay put or else's they would end up dead
Hater ass bitch
IestynBoiiPlayzz !! How thats stupid
AGREED
Ivona Flakus yea he is a massive idiot
That's a lot of YouTube FOLLOWERS
Subscribers bitch not followers
The only fucked up thing about it is theres a place called suicide forest lol
suicide isn't funny :( its sad
sick boi
OMFG there is many youtubers there has been in the suicide forest
Hmm didnt do it for view?? Okay? How stupid can you be? You dont go inside the suicide forest with a camera and start shooting and not expect to see someone there.. hence why its called what it is... the fact that he even filmed the video and posted it on youtube? Right thats not racking views and likes ? Because it totally went viral.. thats the same BS every youtube stars say when they made a huge mistake... blah blah this.. we didnt do it for the views or likes blah blah.. lools
Shot up!!
So wait.... this dude has to apologize for this guy hanging himself?? Did the guy apologize for allowing someone to stumble across his body/selfish act?? The freaking place is called "Suicide Forest"... What did you think you would see there? This is stupid.
His apology was just damage control. He doesn't care about suicide or the culture he just disrespected. It was definitely about the views because there are way better ways to bring suicide awareness to an audience of 15 million teenagers and children.
Its not like Logan paul can say "i didn't know it was in the video" because it was in the title
The idiots who reasoned to Logan Paul like that were wish a**holes.
Imagine getting jumped and hearing Logan Paul say " wait lemme record"
logan 
A certain visual novel did a better job at raising suicide awareness
Racist piece of shit deserves no money
Was the dead body even real?.
Logan is sooo disrespectful! You should never take any photo or videos with dead bodies.  I'm outraged!
omg  
Fuck u adc
oh no talk of you
He just made a mistake don't hate
No Logan apologised and is rly sorry don't need to make him feel worse
Im glad that they tried their best to be unbiased when it comes to the situation.
Las mediocres defensoras: "es la primera vez que ve un cuerpo, no supo como reaccionar".. a ver pelotuda, tal vez no sabes reaccionar el el momento. No tenes que tener muchos dedos de frente para saber que si un tipo est colgado en el monto famoso por los suicidios...es que se quito la vida. Entonces? La capacidad de razonar de que el tipo se quito la vida y que es algo horrible...no es muy complicado. Encima...pasar HORAS editando el video, con esa letra pedorra, todo muy superficial. Horas...das para darse cuenta de la pelotudez que estaba haciendo y tampoco le cay la ficha de lo que haba visto? Saben por qu?  Porque es un pelotudo,egocentrico, que no tiene nada en la cabeza...solo diciendo estupideces y mostrandose sexy levanta pendejad.  Ven un rubio de ojos celestes y se les calienta la cachufleta y no reaccionan defienden lo indefendible.
Tbt my 8 year old seen that video he's Paul Logan's mini fan, he didn't understand the video he did question when Logan Paul was gonna upload more videos I just told him he had to go to YouTube jail.
That poor guy..how would you feel if that happened to u Logan? ;-;
Good to see this on the main stream news, hopefully many parents will see this and stop their children from watching him.
Why he was trying to raise awareness no one trusts him but his main purpose of making the video was to raise awareness and after he realized people were looking at it from a different angle he did the right thing and took down the video and wrote a long sincere apology. He can come out to be mature when you really need to be.
Logan Paul is a poor represintation i mean fuck wheres pewdipie
Any thing for likes
They all need butt plugs.Shits coming out of there mouth.
lol hate watch???
Omg is he popular? I just know him just now LOL and im 23. thank god i ddnt know him before. what a stupid idiot bitch. Lol
How dare  you Logan is not going to be on YouTube any more he's retiring his chanl why I hate you guys Logan is not vloging anymore
that white dude is on drugs asf
full uncensored video on dailymotion if anyone wondering
Brylle Cruz Damn, that's pretty fucked up. At least there are less 12 year olds on Reddit, unlike Youtube.
Bianca Gutierrez ive seen close-up uncensored HD shots of ISIS decapitating people , people's faces after being ripped-off by rifles and the sounds of bodies hitting the ground in suicide videos of people jumping off buildings all on reddit . 
_I've been scarred years ago..._ but I'm just glad that kind of shit isn't on Youtube like this was .
That's fucking disgusting. Nobody would want to watch that sick, gross video. Aren't you traumatized of watching close-up shots of a dead body?
There's another uncensored in Pornhub hehe
Brylle Cruz FUCK U
Oh no. Youre dead bro!
Dani Khi L Better get the camera
you know when someone says theyre a logang i wonder if they ever see the other videos if he doesnt actually be disrespectful than we can give him a chance but he disrespect the whole japanese culture
U will be dead not him it was a mistake
Oh YES he's dead alright
good he cant brainwash people anymore
Everything he does in two years will be forgotten, if he was non-white he would have been banned and all endorsements would have taken away! The world worship blonde hair blue-eyed white man and all his actions will be forgiven. That is the sad part!
Out of many we always have one ass hole that make it hard for everyone, his apology is shit!
agreed but tha makes him kinda hard to gain subscribers
what, you have nothing else to do? thank you for everything. 
you hating or you supporting
I Saw the Video!
okay,so some retarded 'logangsters' are now hating on ABC?
R.I.P Logan Paul indeed e.e
Angel of Darkness 
grrr die
he's still alive
Ty H lol learn to spell kid
there are more trivial things then a young aristocrat who would commit suicide him self for a 2 simple reason. 1. he i not justin biber 2. is deffinitly a gay twat and those kind of people can only make satir out of sarcasam but whats for dinner? i guess paoul logan has a loud login in chat but in facts are cheaters and victims of the horoscope, lion king wanna be also presidents with small genetically modified "not gready" hands lol  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIfdjMRqM98
This moment needs to be written down as a historical moment. 
I want to comit suicide and this is not funny go burn in hell logan
He probably didn't mean it he probably thought it was very strange and described what happened. He is very sorry about this. Give him one more chance. Plz
       Yes ? Find a unicorn forest or a suicide unicorn forest . Glad i still know the difference !  Even if he had someone from japan doesnt give him the reason/rights to disrespect the people there and the country . Guess logan didnt teach you guys much about respect . Instead of Logan Paul try google . Its way better .
Purified Water i'm sorry, but he's actually 22 not 7. yeah... you should probably get your eyes tested if you think he looks like a 7 year old.
Sha Ee Rah yes.
ProzSkilLz he had someone from Japan with him clearly he didn't offend the WHOLE because he was watching him film him and at least he didnt show his face
You wouldn't say this if it was your dead mother. No more second chances for that 7 year old
#deleteloganpaul
#deletebobbynibbles
Bobbynibbles how about you #deleteyourlifecunt
OG Games&Vlogs , pro gamer11 ,bobby nibbles Nicolas_sanas, DoloresAyala, shut the fuck up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Logan is not that bad of a person and kids look at the comments. SO STOP ACTING LIKE LITTLE GIRLS AND SHUT THE FUCK UP OR IM GOING TO FIND YOU AND SLAP YOU IN THE FACE!!!!!!!!!
john Lain good stay in the logang
Bobbynibbles HE DIDNT KNOW I WAS THE SUICIDE FORSET BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN IN JAPAN
Logan could have been smart and not posted this video in the first place
That little brat tries to apologize to us?pft,ain't going to work
I even though Logan was better than Jake,his dim witted brother
But no,he started this
Then I'll let them come
Since they are young,they should be easy to take down
bruh edit fast before those brainwashed comes to your comment and try to roast you by correcting on your spelling then delete this comment
I love Logan to the moon and back
I agree it is wrong but he does have a warning before the video so it is your choice to watch not his
How you famous and you walk into the woods and randomly find a man that hangs him self I have a feeling it was you what a coincidence I dont get it how was it you that got to see it
he actully delet the viedeo
yo wtf is with your spelling i usually doesnt correct people spelling but like umm you might want to go to grammar classes
So sernandoe got terminated yesterday so when is Logan?????
OH MY GODS, JUST ACCEPT IT. COME ON. HE APOLOGIZED. I KNOW THAT NO ONE'S PERFECT AND THIS WAS A HUUUGE MISTAKE, BUT HE SAID SORRY.
Maria Angela Ramirez THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. AN APOLOGY ISN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING!! HE MADE FUN OF SOMEONE WHO TOOK THEIR LIVES AND SUICIDE IT'S SELF! WAKE UP!
Maria Angela Ramirez 
"BUT HE APOLOGIZED!!!!1!1!1!!1"
Just because you apologized, doesn't mean you are actually sorry, nor does it mean that we have to forgive you. If you kill a person and then say sorry, it doesn't change the fact that you are a murderer and are going to jail. And it wasn't a mistake. It was a choice.
When I Read Yours It Makes Me Think
Posting a My Dead Hanging Grandfather Who Raised Me From Birth Until my Parents Died of a Tornado and Then a Random Person who was Walking into a Place Called Suicide Forest was Shocked to See a Body and Filmed it and Said Found a Dead Body in a Japense Suicide Forest and Try to Accept his Apology?
Did you even see his initial apology?
Maria Angela Ramirez you are right every one makes mistakes
Guy looks like a douchebag, but he's not the only one at fault, YouTube allowed that video to be posted, every video that have adds in it is viewed first by someone at Google or YouTube. So someone saw that and said "yep that's totally fine" Google and YouTube didn't do shit until they got backlash from it.
I feel like ABC news is trying to get views from writing logan paul
ima freakng maverick nothing can change that #Logang
yeah i think a better hastag is #brainwashedkids
bruh i love logan paul but now i cant watch him   
I already wanted to be in the jake paulers
The 15m people are dumbass fuck too
2018 IS FUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
come one lets just pray but make sure to keep logan out for his behaviour at the temple
How the fucking hell does showing a dead man on YouTube create a 'POSITIVE RIPPLE'?!
Just Watch Pewdsss
Ironic that Logan Paul commited career suicide in suicide forest
Ai fcut pe dracu' b Logan
Some of you people are waiting for someone telling you if it was staged or not,  absurd. Can we just use logic?HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS GOING AND DOING,  HE DID IT ANYWAY AND NOW HE IS IN TROUBLE. Plain simple. Have a nice day
Logan Paul likes to break plates
It so happens that one plate was written career
*claps*
BoredwithYoutube_ 
xD holy papa
 ur right
OOOOOOOoooooooooo, he ded!
let's smash a plate over his fucking head 
I unsubscribed. Im disappointed in him.
Oh my god, an intelligent person.
Faith in humanity restored! Thank you for seeing his wrong doings!
good on you for realizing who he is. most people are in disbelief and still try to take up for him thanks from japan!
Get him off you tube my teens watch him! He is an immature 22 year old baby..... No excuse for this behavior. There are people out there that really need money he is making millions acting like a fool! What has happened to YouTube? Since when is suicide okay for a youtuber to show on their channel?
Know what's funny every video I see of Logan Paul they don't have as much subs as Logan, Jake, and romanatwood so I feel like their taking advantage over logan's mistake so their making more videos of him just so they get more views and subscribers. Like if u agree.
Its terrible how their first take on this issue is "you may not know what your children are watching"
Don't talk shit about logan he just felt bad to the person who did it to himself you fucking adsholes
What the name of this vlog?
he took it down
Never watched him
Shows how dumb Americans really are.
Why is he getting so much hate when other people have done the same crap search suicide forest on YouTube and see how many people have done that same video
You tube is getting about of control. Too much reality
come on he even blured the dead body!!!! WTF why are you literally eating his brainnnn!!!!! and why is the number 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  end with teen? couse the people whu are 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 they are teens!!!! and logan is not a teen anymore!!!
Good grief....  It was tasteless but there are endless videos the same out there.  It is sad that he maybe didn't think before he did it because I am sure after it happened he would have understand that it was wrong to post.  We all feed into these YouTube stars and egg them on to do more and more on their channel, then blame them when it is criticized.  I am glad there was no Internet when I was a teen.
Logan Paul just revealed his own behaviour.Well uh...rip Logan Paul?
It's like bro the vid was age restricted, had multiple warnings of sensitive content and it was his first time seeing a dead body. 
Give the guy a break, not like you've never laughed at something inappropriate to give relief of a difficult situation.
 Okay then, I'm just a cold hearted ahole.
Isaac Blank i have seen a dead body. i watched someone die in front of me. which makes it all the more disgusting of what he did.
 I will only ask have you ever seen a dead body. 
I know it's sensitive because it was  suicude but everyone was very startled by it and it would be even more insensitive if they started to fake cry.
Just my thoughts though, your opinion is your opinion.
Issac Blank you basically just implied that kids don't lie about their age on the internet to view this "age restricted content" i did it before. pretty sure i'm not the only one nowadays... sensitive content warnings don't justify anything when he put it in his title, loud and clear "WE FOUND A DEAD BODY IN THE SUICIDE FOREST GUYS HAHA THIS IS CRAZY RIGHT?" people with common sense and respect don't laugh AT A FUCKING SUICIDE. you are justifying them LAUGHING. AND JOKING. AT A PERSON WHO KILLED THEMSELVES. reflect on that like holy shit, dude. i laugh at sex jokes, dark humor, but one thing i would never laugh at, is an actual person who passed away. it's like going to a funeral and cracking jokes about it.
I think
Jake paul: hehehe logan is now being hated yess i can get many subs
Logan is bleh. Hes very disrespectful
He has 15 million FOLLOWERS... 
DID SHE SAY FOLLOWERS? 
IT'S SUBSCRIBERS BRO! 
#TRIGGERED
I bet it was meant as a play on words since some of his "subscribers" have such devotion to LP to earn the title of "follower".
People go to the suicide forest for one reason. He did it on purpose obviously. Sorry not Sorry.
Leave Logan Paul alone your just finding someone to f**k with because you have to ruin some popular person so you can become bigger and that is just how almost every popular person got big
not really? lol
Maybe watch other videos that does this stuff they showed bones of a person and a body people do your job you do this stuff to Logan maybe cause your jealous that's what a lot of people teach these days
there's an actual difference... he filmed a dead body. he walked up to it, cracked jokes about it afterwards, etc... don't pull that argument. they don't shout about it for views and put that shit in their titles. people do disturbing things on youtube and show disturbing things in their thumbnails, but logan paul fucked up on this one. furthermore, why would i be jealous of a white male that comes to my country just to disrespect my culture and my country? i'm glad i'm not him.
... and if that person just held on for however many hours, he would have met Logan ...
no one in japan knows LP tho. they do now, they know him as someone who represents america. not in the good way.
These Journalists Know Less Than My Dog
I hope he is haunted by the ghost he laugh at.
go Logan Paul
THE FUCK YOU MEAN ALLEGEDLY!!!!! HE LITERALLY DID THAT!! LOGAN PAUL DISRESPECTED A DEAD MAN AND A WHOLE CULTURE AND COUNTRY WITH CUSTOMS BUILT COMPLETELY AROUND BEING RESPECTFUL!!!!! DO NOT TELL ME THIS WAS JUST ALLEGED!!!!!!
GUYS MAYBE THE GUY WAS JUST FAKING...?!
35ey rogan !I am of the 35-year-old Japanese woman.I want a classy touristsI send this word to you.I want to kick your ass.thank you.
Who is he? Why people like him?
Yall make big deal and say how he is a bad influence on the kids and stuff but long before he started vloging this stuff was already goin on most of these deaths happen becuz of the kids. And the fact that all the news do is cover the story they give you more details about the shit thats happening. One man thought his friend hanging himself was art we aint hear bout this bullshit. The fact that all the people in the comments are making fun of Logan for making fun of the deceased Asian man are yall no better. How would u feel if you slipped up and said the wrong thing or did the wrong thing and a whole epidemic broke out about this tiny problem escalated in to the Black Plague. Now you people discussed me all the celebrities that give other celebrities hell disgusting. Now feed on that.
 no im not saying that it wasnt disrespectful how he filmed a man who took his life for his own reasons. But we dont know that reason he could of been doin the wrong things in life. But life isnt all that sunshine and rainbow shit like this is bound to happen but 1 person cant stop it. Do u think the news cares no they just want to cover a story American star finds Dead asian man and make fun of him i can tell u now America is a shitty place. We dont know anything bout the hell hole so. Why do you guys have a forrest like that if yall wanted to make a diffrence then you would stop that shit block of the forrest so ask yourself are yall really no diffrent then them? Yea speechless right. And a funeral is a beautiful place you watch your loved one move on to a better place have a better life.
so you're saying you'd go to a funeral and make fun of the person you died? what if it was your family member? bf/gf? right, didn't think so. we allowed him into our country and he disrespected it, and filmed a dead body in the suicide forest. then make fun of it. that's disgusting.
wow ! that's how a typical young american person behave? I can't believe how dumb is that guy!!!!
Wow followers lol it's called subscribers
Leave logen alone he made one mistake because he is humen people make mistakes
isn't it past your bedtime?
you know some other people have done this one YouTube but now when logan did it you care that much I don't care what people say I love Logan Paul and love his volgs
no one has ever done this on youtube. that alone proves you don't understand the situation.
I'm not trying to be on Logan's side. I can be wrong about what I'm about to say.. but like isnt it the person who filmed its fault. I mean I haven't seen the vid, idk if Logan took the camera and recorded it himself. even tho I still agree this was a horrible desicion and the desicion has consequences.
I wonder whats with people doin reuploads..... didn't he take down the video?? people hated it, yet, the reupload it. I'm just confused right now.
((sorry if I'm coming out rude))
they reupload it so they can see how much of a shit human being he is
STOP WITH THE HATE OMG
nah karma still isnt finish
Karma at its finest
why? what he did is clearly wrong
even japanese people like myself think what he did was retarded. like come on lmao.
He deserve the criticism that what he did was stupid in his vlog.
HEYY WHO DOESNT FORGIVE LOGANG HE KNOWS IT WAS A MISTAKE! :(((

Boi its not followers its subscriber
Logan Paul plays around u dont have the right to talk about him he did the wrong thing but doesnt everyone make mistakes this isnt right.
Same but except for not liking him
ahhh rip that makes sense then. yeah, i think his stupidity is kinda funny lmao. i don't like him as a person but i don't mind making fun of his idiocy
Oh put can be a sieve idiot sometimes but its that that makes my day better
because it was such an uproar in my country because of his stupid behavior and acts that i couldn't NOT watch it? it's all over my youtube recommendations because i watch japanese youtubers? ???????????
Then why u talk but dont watch
Wow Idk who he is but He should get deleted from YouTube
ive heard of the video but i didnt see it and im glad i didnt
Everyone is taking advantage on using his name to get VIEWS!!!!
Logan Paul just made a mistake do not be mad a him
He was a idiot at all
Give the boy a break already, he messed up cause he's freaking human!
Kid, Logan Paul is an Idiot. He is a disgrace to America, he also disrespected the Japanese Culture.
Jillian Harkawik 
No. We are not going to give him a break. Sometimes, you mess up so bad that you can never take it back. Fuck this guy.
So where was his humanity when he filmed and posted the video???
Jillian Harkawik well nobody in their right mind would video a dead guy......he is obviously insane
yes but have you seen the damage he caused to people not only in japan but all around the globe? he did it for fucking views too. stop taking up for some 22 year old manchild.
omg stop that's just rude he didn't mean any harm
I hate Logan poul
Logan Paul is right
Im glad smosh has more subscribers
I just finished watching the video above and I thought I'd join the rest of the comment section and express my own thoughts.
For those of you saying that he made a mistake and that it's okay because everyone makes mistakes...no. This is not the same thing as making a mistake. This is not a learning experience for him. This is pure stupidity and idiocy at its finest. I'm also aware that he uploaded two "apology" videos, but he isn't sorry. I know he isn't. People like him never are. He's an egotisical degenerate who one day decided to go camping in Aokigahara (a.k.a ~ the suicide forest) and make a vlog about it. Not only that, but he acts like he wasn't expecting to see a dead body in the forest. It DOES have that nickname for a reason. To make things even worse, he shoves a camera in the face of a man who recently lynched himself and later uploads it to his YouTube channel ~ which is an audience of mostly children fifteen and under ~ and all for views, fame, and money. 
I can also rant about this on a personal level. I have a little twelve-year-old brother who looks up to Logan Paul. He aspires to be like that numbskull some day and even takes his side in the whole "he was only raising awareness for suicide" thing. It's unacceptable. There are other ways...several other ways, to raise awareness for suicide. Exposing a dead body on the internet? That's the worst way of getting the word out. Especially since he was laughing over the whole situation and mocking the issue. As someone who struggles with depression and other mental distresses on a daily basis, I am enraged at the behavior the all mighty Logan Paul has displayed. Depression really isn't something to be taken lightly and it's a serious problem in the world. I've grown mentally stronger over the years, but when I was younger (and I'm talking like seven or eight years old)...I would have suicidal thoughts or even attempt to commit suicide many times. 
It's really upsetting to think that the man who hung himself in Logan's video thought it was necessary to take his own life because he just couldn't go on any longer. Then to put the cherry on top of that "Logan Paul is the biggest pr**k on Earth sundae", that clown comes up and films what he has found. Any respectable person would've shut the camera off and maybe have a few moments of silence and continue on about their day. There is no excuse for what he has done and I really do hope that his channel is banned off of this website. It's disgusting and what he uploads in general isn't even entertaining.
So to wrap up my novel I've just written, he can go suck a d**k, give himself a swirly, and then go burn in the depths of Hell.
to kill myself, i would climb on logan'and jump into his IQ level.
i love people who show mentally ill depressed suicidal people for views, hangs out in maximum security places for no reason, and throws poke balls at Asians to be racist and funny, then has humble boasting as his idea of being sorry.
YOUR STUPID IT WAS NOT LOGAN PAUL FAULT
Lets All Hope He Starts 2019 Well :)
I hope his channel has been deleted by 2019.
Sadly his career was shot down at the starting line-
Roblox Gamer nope lets hope he stats the next month good
Emad Hamdache I Realized He Quitted YouTube So Im Deeply Sorry
Lps Family At Least My Comment Has More Likes You Ramen Noodle Hair
Is the video deleted??
What the fuck. He showed the body,
Omg I lived in japan 3yrs...now I dont...thx va and us navy for that...*ahem..
But real talk not offended by logan paul...hes just a shock jock...now I aint defending logan paul in anyway.
But is the public outraged cuz of logans shocking taste or cuz of the reality that logan shared...did logan create suicide forest? Maybe that logan crime eh?
I do know that japan is trying to grow and it wants to be us citizens home after possible collapse.
My point is, guyz not be sooo outraged, but look at why. Suicide forest has existed long time.
But all ridiculuous aside.
Hell all logan shock jock aside in this case logan just jouralizing. Doesnt mean Id watch a single damn video of his.
If cnn broadcasted that would youtube be outraged?
So why is it fair  to be mad at logan?
I know right :/
Apparently?
He didnt mean to
This is fucking bullshit! Everybody posts something bad and they don't get in trouble and he fucking does? And now, you people think it is fucking okay to post this?!?! What is wrong with you people? Why the fuck would you do that? Do you even know how pissed he is gonna fucking be!?! ASSHOLES!!
Y'all are Peace's of shit Logan said they didn't expect that
Be a maviric
ABC your woried about this the world is getting warmer and there is a war in country s and f#@* ABC

SUBSCRIBERS not FOLLOWERS
Funny cuz i have no idea who logan paul is.
They call subscribers followers than at the end of the video they say click here to subscribe not follow us so they use both!?!?!?!? That's even worse!
Everyone go watch Gaijin Goombas video on the topic to see how many lives Logan has affected by making this tasteless video.
if you focking diss on him then you and all the assholes made him scared for life he allways posts every single day and guess what he stoped.
Titanium Llama // TTL I'd like to see how much time you took in writing this comment

Ill Im saying rn and this is the last thing Im gonna say is Logan is a good man and he is one of my favorite YouTubers but he made a big mistake
It's Rachael 29 He didnt make a mistake. He made a choice.
It's Rachael 29 HE IS CANCER HE SHOULD DIE
Wow, the outrage from you guys was deafening................I didn't hear it. If Trump drinks 12 cans of diet cola you lose your shit. Logan Paul videos a dead body and you muster a tsk tsk. Patheic
Omfg news you are stupid it's clearly fake so is Logan and YOU
D34THJUMPER and I'm Pretty Sure I'm Human...Last Time I Checked
D34THJUMPER Not Really It's A Real Person
You know what I think? I dont care. I have no respect for people who take their own lives. I had a friend who had killed himself because of depression, of which we knew of, yet he didnt care. He wouldnt let us help him and he overdosed himself and after his death i wasnt in grief... i was in anger. I was angry at how selfish he could be to purposefully ignore help and choose the easy way out.  The only thing Logan did wrong was using the body in the thumbnail, nothing more.   I wanna hear what some of you find controversial about this situation.
He needs to be kicked off YouTube
Why to people even find this guy entertaining?  He is literally just a drama seeker who to me doesn't have a grasp of emotions that a 10 year old would have.
Leave him alone
Plus that literally says suicide forest and how do people make that when dead people are not even buried
* sip's tea *
Men:Hey I wanna suicide 
Woman: Dang then do it
'Men died'
#saveloganpaul

Arianator_Moonwalker 4ever Nervous laughter is laughter evoked from an audience's expression of embarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement. Nervous laughter is usually less robust in expression than "a good belly laugh", and may be combined with confused glances or awkward silence on the part of others in the audience. Nervous laughter is considered analogous to a courtesy laugh, which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to move a situation along more quickly, especially when the comedian is pausing for laughter.
It's still on YouTube
"Allegedly" Fuck that! Guy's an asshole, spent most of his time in Japan disrespecting the people and culture. He did this so he'd be the first big news controversy in 2018.
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THE INTERNET IM CRYING I LOVE LOGAN SO LEAVE HIM ALONE ITS JUST NOT FAIR
Now the other paul brother
At my school people started talking about this so I diside. To watch

Just a quick fact for anyone who didn't know, Logan Paul made approximately $12k from his apology video
I know he stupid right is stupid
logan ate the shit
logan boku yedi
I'm still confused on how this idiot is so famous & popular.
the only people over 12 that are watching him are his fucking parents
Not apparently. It does.
SO CRAZY THIS MAN OR EAVEN IDIOT
but he was laughing  at the body
LAGON IS PIECE OF GARBAGE AND WE AL AGREE ON IT
If he was sorry and trying to "raise awareness", he wouldn't be laughing about it.
Logan Paul fan base love him and those parent but his stuff they no about him
I can't believe it
Bull shit logan Paul "raise awearness" MY ASS U don't deserve all that money!
He is cancer
He is stupid and do all kind of stupid shit but at the times I dont even know how the government have basically a forest where people commit suicide
gfy Logan
I'm so glad my mum didn't see this or then I would be not aloud on youTube
AppareNT?
1:25 because some people are actually decent and have more brain cells than you Logan
His such an idiot
Boo Logan Paul Boo!
Find the difference 
logan paul
Boooooooooooo
WHY CANT YOU JUST GET OVER IT, YOU SAW HE WAS MAKNG FUN OF A DEAD MAN, SO WHAT MND YOUR OWN BUISNESS, WHY DO U CARE ABOUT HIM YOUR HOS FATHER NEITHER MOTHER ... GET REAL LIVES ABC NEWS, yeah right your the real "ABC NEWS" I'll call you "FAKE NBC NEWS' BACK OFF HATERS . WHY NOT YOU GO STICK YOUR HEAD IN A TOULET,. why not YOU go commit suicide and SEE HOW MUCH BETTER YOU FEEL THEN YOU COME BACK AND SAY SORRY TO LGAN PAUL AND BE HIS SLAVE OR ELSE IMA FIND YOU GUYS. ..  I WILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Logan Paul is a worthless piece of shit, but everyone bitching at him are a bunch of SJW trash. Who gives a fuck about a bunch of retards who killed themselves ?
"I intended to raise something for suicide prevention.' Yeah, sure you did by laughing at it that makes so much sense.
Yep, 2018 sucks already.
Hang him so we can all laugh at him
Not only he being a shitty person by showing a dead body but also he was being a little shit messing with people going on about their day In Japan its just disturbing all of this is just disturbing and disgusting its too much
oh shit its on abc news
He did nothing wrong. Leave Logan along
Ya'll realize though he posted a very bad and uncalled video, that harrassing him is no better. You say he's a bad person for making a big mistake. Everyone makes mistakes no matter how big or small they are. But talking bad against him and putting someone down is one of the reasons people commit suicide in the first place. Don't lower yourself.
He is in booking
This guy is pretty fucked up. He needs mental help
Logan has been disrespectful he became his little brother jake paul is also disrespectful
I'm laughing at how he said that he was trying to spread suicide awareness. Lmao if you were really trying to, you wouldn't film a dead body and LAUGH about it. If anything, that is only making suicidal people worse. Even a primary school kid could make a better video about suicide awareness for a school assignment.
GUESE WHAt I feel bad for Markiplier because of his friend that killed himself
Screw you I love Logan paul
When the news gets on the trends
pls subscribe me i am new to the youtube
What is the video called that Logan made?
Shame on you, Logan Paul. We do not want your fake " Sorry". You'd better do something for the young fans, or they will lose a chance to see the world correctly. You are a 22-year-old adult. Remember!!
Logan paul is a very good man you should not do this one YouTube  because  if you want to said then said to the 15million people that are on his back
Where is the vid?
I feel like I'm searching left and right trying to see the full uncensored video just to see the dead guy. Then I would be satisfied.
Geoff Lam
what is Liveleak?
wtf, then you are no better.
Aniya Sparkles ummmmm wtf
Dont do that... You wont find it anyways its his footage he uploaded it blurred
I miss Logan making videos
forgive and move on
Link        forgiving is moving forward from anger to loving and caring for them that hurt you. Sometimes people won't always apologize , so we can help by forgiving and showing love
I get your point. But let me make an example, if someone steals from you, would just forgive them and move on? They'll realize this and so they'll steal from you again, and you'll keep forgiving. At some point you'll be bankrupt.
I believe one can only be forgiven after a justified punishment.
Link      forgiveness is for everyone
Hey again, how about no.
"He has fifteen million *followers* on Youtube."
Bianca Gutierrez *oh yea lool*
Bianca Gutierrez I made a video of how LP almost died I would appreciate it if you checked it out
EASY _YT stfu JUST DUCKING FORGIVE HIM WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES HE SHOWED A DEAD BODY OK WHAT IF IT WAS U IN THAT SITUATION U WOULD BE CRYING LIKE A BUTCH SO STFU

WHY I DONT WANT LOGAN PAUL TO STOP GIS CAREER WHY!!!!!
Honestly, he is not sorry and he just wanted more subs
I mean like he shudnt be getting hate!!! Ik young viewers wud be like OMG WTF but still i think we need to forgive him since he took the video down
Busted
logan paul is better than them
apparent suicide victim? what
There you go Logan.. you are now see on tv. Double views!
Dutieyqq,
The video just got deleted
hes a dumb ass
........
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Death for Logan! Nowhere is safe for him now. Even in the bathroom! I am finding out him and....... hahaHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Righto kiddy's time to move on and  away from this absolute mind melting simple IDIOT. People like this make you sick. Abandon it!!!
Love life.
Total douchebag .. n rubbish contains
shut the fuck up abc you fucking sucks STFU #LOGANG4LIFE
Enternainment industrie is disgasting!
All I one of the only people who never liked him?
why do they say allegedly when we have the prove that he did it?
He did it for views! He needs more and more views!!!
I'm only watching this because I like hate against Logan. But I'd probably most definitely do what he said, I already do.
15 million followers
Suicide victim??
Yes because mocking dead people is suicide awareness. Honestly, how much dumber are people going to get these days?
Ugh Ive never liked Logan Paul -.-
Shut up
This is just feeding Logan. YOU POSTING THIS SHIT IS MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE.
So... What exactly is the problem here?
Dumb fuck
Social media man fuck. Especially all the ignorance Moms and dads and little kids. Who here thinks that if he saw a real dead body would he re-act the same ? No of course not.
Logan made a mistake and yes it was wrong to do what he did but he has come to realize it. Those of people who are being rude need to understand he actually is a good person. He doesnt need to be reminded of his mistake constantly. I feel for him because when you watch his apology video you can see the the goodness in his heart.
Lets be honest Logan only did 1 bad things but he apologised he is probably tired and can't think being a daily vloger  he have alot of sleepless night especially when they are traveling people who say shit about him is like meaaa i never do anything like this b4 bla bla all i want to say is logan is not a monster he is nice #forgivelogan
Such a coincidence it's a suicide forest a dead body is what you would expect in a suicide forest
But they' re not lie ing he my. Second favourite Youtuber.i want to go to japan
Hes an adult dont treat him like a baby, he should have known better by now. this isnt a growing up experience wtfff hes grown up, he can drink alcohol, pay taxes, lives on his own, hes not a baby hes a balding adult.
His sorry video has now 37 million views and it is his 7 most viewed video and its been there for less than week!
I will never forgive you.
Curse     you
Oh and you guys make NO money. Please. Quit pretending you're bunch of commoners, when you're nothing but limousine sipping on don perignion wanna be middle-class-man. Multi millionaires trying to convince a gullible audience they're NOT! Starting with George...
      ""    
Top entertainment influencer? Eye catching videos? I saw spinets of the vlogs he did in Japan and all he did was be an arrogant, asshole showing no respect for anyone and the culture. How is that funny? How is that entertainment?
Hmm yall didnt show him saying dont comit suicide....
Was he supposed to know that he was going to see a dead person
He did call the police 
Theres porn on youtube but when a BLURRED  hanging person is showed he gets attacked
I dont think that he click baited i think he had that thumbnail to show that he wasnt lying..
And why are you people surprised to see a dead body in a place called SUICIDE Forest
Seems like the famous Youtubers are slowly ending PewDiePie had a scandal now it's time for logan...
fuck all of you news people i love longan paul
0:33 "15 million followers on youtube" despite what an idiot Logan is that is the only thing I can think of. YouTube "followers"
Guess Jake Paul is better now....
logan paul is a peice of trash and should be ripped up and then smashed in a car crusher
Can you stop he said sorry 
I hate what he did in freakin Japan I wanted to kill him
he can't play bass guitar He can't play electronic guitar he can't even play drums to heavy metal music and I am never ever ever ever ever support Logan Paul for his stupidity
I am not a psychopath for thinking nothing was wrong what he did right?
Ughhhhhh leave Logan alone
do we even know the name lol seriously its fake until someone can tell me and link me proof otherwise.
Real celebrities were cursing at him damn he made Jesse pinkman and Sansa Stark mad
Nobody should judge Logan Paul its not like he did it for the views
OH MY GOSH CAN EVERYONE SHUT THE F*CK UP ABOUT THE "DRAMA"!?!?! I KNOW HE MESSED UP BUT THESE YOUTUBERS DONT HAVE TO DO THIS SH*T!!!!!!! FIRST PEWDIEPIE NEXT EH DEH BEE FAMILY THEN JACKSEPTICEYE, CHRISTAN DELGROSSO NOW THIS?!?!?!! LIKE-F*UCKING-GOSH
Foreigners should not be allowed in the forest or at least not with any recording devices ....idiots literally go to the suicide forest to find dead ppl as if it's something fun to do 
OMG STOP IT NOW WITH IT OKAY HE MADE A BIG MISTAKE SO DO ALL OF YOU HE IS JUST A PERSON  WHO  DIDINT MEAN TOO I FORGIVE YOU LOGAN PAUL
people that are calling him idiot need jesuse because God created people who you would not hate on he created people so you can love them no matter what they do you still have to love them as a family as a brother or a sister don't hate people like Logan Paul
Yeah but... God ain't real.
Are you retarded? Any Church wont never allow people to make fun of the dead.. Even God
You're just sad you know that. Pathetic.
Dude, heres a random scenario, if a murderer killed everyone you loved, would you still give him or her a chance????
Maty Ramos are you mentally retarded?
I haven't been paying attention to this. But once the news starts talking about it. well shoot. you know this is terrible.
FIRST OF ALLL...when abc said 'allegedly' .....did they not bother to see the video with the dead body? If they want to be correct and not defend him then they should say he posted a video that included a dead body, in a forest where 'allegedly' people go to commit suicide.  Not make it seem as if the dead body is actually dead or not.
But he laughed at the dead body
SUBSCRIBERS!!!!
He laughed at a joke his friend said......
My mom well not stop talking about this THANKS ALOT
What is scary is that Logan Paul apologized only after the criticism.
Its a new day now
I hate Logan because some of my family were from Japan and my friend is Japanese and her great grandpa comied suiside over three years ago so now he's a disgrease
Anyone that actually watches his channel can see how disrespectful this kid is. He reminds me the maturity of Justin Beiber when he first started.
So a mass murderer gets 24x7 coverage for a few days and the press speculates about every aspect of his life; but a man driven to suicide?  Don't ask, don't even show his body.
Omg that one video about the dead body had gone viral omh
Poor logan 
hello see my videos please and suscribance, thank you, I love you
hola vean mis videos porfavor y suscribance , gracias ,los amo
Hey... dont take his topic it promotes his movement and make money
Followers 
ITS SUBSCRIBERS
I know many people might disagree with me but honestly I think in a few days he should start vlogging again and not even mention the whole Suicide forest thing. I feel like if he stops talking about it everyone else will chill out and Logan can go back to doing what he loves but as a matured person that has learned from his mistakes. Idk thats just me
Stephen Doran - also! Maybe thats the reason you have no subs!
Stephen Doran - You are so rude maybe you are just an annoying piece of shit , You should just live in the garbage oh wait! You are living in the garbage
NotMostGirls u are high hes loaded
Ced Gamer get a live
hello see my videos please and suscribance, thank you, I love you
This got the the fucking news
Literally should rot in a prison guys
Hes the type of guy that sucks himself off while he apologizes.
"I didn't do this for views, I get views."
Well theres 2018 down the drain
Yup just a couple of dumb Americans 
He a ass fucked YouTube need to take down his channel
Lmao calling subscribers "followers" makes Logan paul sound like a cult leader 
SJ Lang ikr
I ecsept.his forgivness
????what are you saying you accept his forgiveness?
ABC please you don't know anything else he did like being childish and racist to a Asian country. So if you want to make  news about something please research more and if you don't just stop your news channel.
ABC news  -_-
*sigh*
He messed up really bad congrats you got on the news Logan!
A lot of his fans forgave him like meeee
Logang = life
Sonya Rivera Logan = shit
There subscribers not followers
kakyoin noriaki lol
Lol 15 million followers on YouTube
I don't usually quote anybody from YouTube but I'm gonna quote Some Dumb American right now. why didn't YouTube take the video down? after all it does violate their terms and conditions.
So basically, what I got from this video was: abc currently employs, bitch ass niggas.....hypocritical bitch ass niggas at that. Logan Paul showing a dead body on youtube got everyone so "sensitive" in this "Reality T.V. Society" we live in. Meanwhile in November 2016 all of america commited suicide on national T.V. by electing the "King of Reality T.V." As if we didn't see the showing of suicides as the natural progress and evolution of youtube, the "ghetto projects" of all of social media. Youtube is the trailer, the internet is the trailer park, and we are the "cracka's" that live in it. We made this hell, and we're crying like little babies about it.....fuck our hypocrisy, and the insult to our intelligence.
Followers on YouTube. Was I the only one that got chills when she said this?
are you going to post again
He has 15 million followers on YouTube so YouTube is like Twitter now?
I usually think of the positive side of stuff but there's nothing positive about someone even going to a place that should be a owner of the people how took there own life
logan i love u 
Nevaeh Mays you are right
I wish he will come back soon
your love is placed in the wrong person sweetheart
leave logan the fuck alone i love him no matter what he does
Jerr S one how old are u two why the hell are we fighting about anyway its not that important of wat i said i just like his channel OK and i think they took it to far and sry about wat i said i get really sensitive of wat people say and no if. he murdered some one that's his ass going to jail i wont be pretty on that
Nevaeh Mays oh good comeback. And I'm right, aren't I? If Logan murdered someone, you would probably say he didn't do anything wrong.
Nevaeh Mays great response kid. Did you even read what I wrote? No, cause your head is so far up Logan's butt that you can't even read. I'm right, you are a disrespectful, naive and dumb sheep of a child.
Nevaeh Mays of course you love him no matter what. Cause you're a naive, brainless sheep who will defend even if he murders someone. And what you're saying is it's ok to make fun of someone who just killed them self, and that's incredibly disrespectful.
Anyone else heard her say 15million "followers" on youtube
I just came here to give Logan *Pail* shit (yes i meant to spell his name wrong lmao)
This should bring awareness to the world that no matter how "rich" you are if you aren't rich in character, you aren't rich at all. There was absolutely no common sense here and his age truly is showing. Lack of wisdom and grace for his position has led to foolishness.This is dispicable. I wonder if we should consider his mental health and although this may  be controversial to say, I must say there are sociopaths or individuals who lack theory of mind (or the ability to reflect on one's own behaviors as offensive or bothersome to others). Something is seriously wrong here and I question if social media is all there is to it. I do agree SM is to blame for some of these behaviors because those who support it reinforce it. But I still question his ability to think thoroughly about the people he may hurt.
Who you Suck and i hate you your liying
That was my idle
At last he messed up. YouTube KARMA
I watched this on TV
I FORGIVE HIM
"only 22"
That doesn't work at that age, "only 2" maybe...
c mamo
Basically what happened was all the money he made got into his head and that happened, now I hate logan paul I was on Team 10. This comment has the true story. Logan Paul saw a dead man, instead of calling or doing something he made a video plus made fun of the dead man. You know how Jake Paul is Team 10 and Logan Paul is Maverick, yeah well maverick is a clothing line and Logan Paul made all this money and the clothing lost money. So they told someone and LP ( LP for Logan Paul) had 5 days to take the clothing  down or he was going to court. So basically LP stole the name and got in trouble. LP channel was all about making fun of people, and that was not right. If you look at his channel go watch his video that is called I am sorry... he really isnt sorry in my mind because he chose to do it ( Its not like anyone told him to do it) so Team 10 has won in this and yeah. So this was the story and LP and JP werent good or bad people though.
Frisk // Chara sure, if you pay for my ticket
mikei I'm nearly 18, if you don't believe me you can go to Ireland and meet me ok?
Frisk // Chara lol that just proves that you're twelve no 18 year old would act like that haha
mikei are you calling me 12?? No, you got it all wrong, I'm actually 18 next month, my little sister makes videos on this channel, so that proves you wrong! Now please go dig under a hole and die you ignorant child
Frisk // Chara you're just an edgy 12 year old so get off the Internet,  no one cares about your temper tantrums. Learn how to argue properly, jfc
Shut your mouth ok first Logan did not do  Anything but we all make
 stakes but you don't have to make a video Of Logan paul  posting a video so take it down shut up ok
U.m shut up girl and do not talk to me I not dummy ok I think what you are saying I am a dummying ok thx for  The compliment and you are the little kid ha
Tiffanyplays roblox kid, it seems like you are too young or naive to understand what he did. What he did was wrong and dumb and it was a mistake.
NEW VIDEO ON ARE CHANNEL EXPOSING THE TRUTH ON THE WHOLE LOGAN PAUL SITUATION
ABC know nothing but they right
Who gave ABC news the right to use footage from this video? Why the hell are you making a big statement on his video? OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING WORSE THINGS THAN THINGS ON THE INTERNET! YOUR MAKING MONEY WITH YOUR NEWS CHANNEL, LET THE POOR GUY GET HIS MONEY FROM HIS VIEWS! He might have messed up bad, but its not that severe... it was a horrible mistake, but he has deleted the video and banned from Tokyo, now stay in your little lonley hole making news to all the people that watch you, I know it is terrible, but he made a video saying he was sorry and not to be forgived. I am not a fan, but I surley do not like the way you said your comments in how bad it is. It is not the worst, people are robbing, killing, and ect. This isn't the worst thing in the world, so i do not understand why you would put this on your news channel that his family is probably watching. I am not hating nor defending him, I am saying this because we all have equal rights and we can all say our opinion. Plus, he was doing it for a good reason. He did not mean to get a dead body inside of the video. All of the hate comments or dislikes I get, I really do not care.
This year is going to be good
I think he showed it to prove its not a click bait
Heres a re-upload of the original video, including the dead body. So sad he would make this horrible choice... https://youtu.be/btedxSUKaJA
Hmm looks like Logan doesn't know the way....
But i do...
http://m.worldstarhiphop.com/android/video.php?v=wshh3cARSx34iJ59mdt7
when i heard he went in a suicide forest i was excited
logan youhope you low down sicko i hope you lose all you spomcers, you fucking idiot, if i found out you filmed the deceased body of aloved one of mine,i would scrimp and save until i had enough money to fly to the states find you and happily beat the shit out of you while filming it.i hope and prey the parents of that poor unfortunate young man dont see this very sad video of there beloved child, so if you really wanted to see a suicide victim in the infamous woods you could of explained what you saw, you idiot you have done the lowest of the low,all i can say is to the parents loved one's and friends. i am so very very sorry for  your tremendous loss,you need to sew logan for every penny he owns and more logan i hope your family sends you to coventry.
Haters!
Eva Salinas dumb kid!
Never heard of em!!!!
Fucking idiots cannot separate reality and his channel now.
It's gonna take a lot for his name to be cleared from this suicide forest stuff
He literally said sorry
Can you leave the young kid alone Jesus
Fuck the internet Im rich
...Logan Paul
I cant believe he made a joke about the body.
Logan Paul has too much fame and that makes him start doing stupid shit and this isnt acceptable in all ways unless he is willing to go jump in front of a train
There was no blood or gore his face was blurred isn't that enough censored you guys he doesn't like people getting hurt
Destiny Gamer doesn't make it any better, dumb kid
Kids a idiot
I was farting the whole time I watched this
wtf lolololol
me too
But he found a body and people took it away CHILL
Stupid Sophie Turner she is an idiot that dirty faced looser 
Even tho logan was really disrespectful
I thought he was joking when I saw the title.... But I can never unsee his video
Just to let you guys know that it not teens or kids watching some adults watch Logan paul
What's the point of getting into a suicide forest, he makes just Vlog videos, normal vlog won't filming dead body. He did that on purpose
And on the video he said he wasnt supposed to be in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQ0ZzPai7A
I like Jake paul hes nice and hes a really good person I have been a Jake Pauler a long time I got his book and two merchandises Jake inspired me so much  after I saw this a lot of people heard about it kids didnt know and at my school kids have a whole bunch of Logan paul merch my friend use to like Logan after she heard this she stoped lots of people did some people regret they bought his merch.
Don't do that ever
LOGAN PAUL LOGAN4LIFE
You guys are acting like he is a freaking child abuser 
Spky Ruby I have no sympathy for suicide "victims" but he was a dumbass for uploading it because he had the time to edit that out.
sam williams it's a joke fam
So true i mean it wasnt his fault again hate me all you want but im speaking the truth
Zani D your grammar lacks sense
Youre argument lacks sense
hmmmmmmmmmm no respect
The worst but is that YouTube hand picks whats on trending. It was number one!
Omg YouTube give him a break and omg who cares he's really sorry and I know when he's sorry bc I'm he's number one fan and give him a break gezzz
F u guys f the new u just want him to lose him subs nope  f u
what the hell has this got to do with aaron paul and why did he start complaining are they realated.
Huuuuuuuu
This is why I wish to distance myself from humans. Some of us are just so revolting, like Logan himself. Don't film a dead body, show some respect! If you want to talk about suicide prevention, just make a sit down talk video about this encounter, explain that he didn't film it or take a picture for it out of respect and properly address this issue.
you poop
*P O O T I S*
I can't understand way such  famous he's channel on you tube.
Who heard this on the talk too?
I watched before he deleted it
Fuck Logan
he is trash
2018 will not be a good year for Logan paul 
He aint a freaking victim retards
show moar dead bodies.
I hate the news
In the world?...  Jajajajajaja...  Me cago de la risa....  En muchos pases ni lo conocen al pendejo.
i do not like Logan because he is to inappropriate and disrespectful
Hey ABC, here is the real story. Youtube/Google manually reviewed the Logan Paul video on the day it was uploaded and they deemed it suitable for broadcast. Just goes to show that Youtube will allow anything on their platform if it brings in views and revenue. Smaller Youtube channels that re-uploaded the video had the video deleted by Youtube. Double standards here. Logan Paul can upload whatever he likes with Youtubes blessing because of his subscription numbers. Bet you won't run this story because you won't want to piss off Google by calling them out on their double standards and corporate greed.
15 million followers on YouTube?
It's SUBSCRIBERS NOT FOLLOWERS
Selfish narcisist brat.
It is a suicide forest......duh
I seen the video yes he shouldn't have shown the body but yes do you guys see how bad he feels he apolagized and wrote a giant post to all the people that saw the video ( Im one of them ) and he was very dissapointed in himself he doesn't deserve all this hate
Does these people know that people work hard for what they have
You suck you think he tried to find the body he would know people would get mad
I would say I'm dead but I'm afraid he'll film me
Okay i'm unsubing to him
fuck you
I will draw logan paul.
Roses Are Red  what's wrong with you .Now I will draw you
GetALifeCause MineSucks. you're right. your life does suck
All of you a fan o logan paul needed to shut the hell up you guys are still kids. That dumbfuck brainwashed you guys. You will know it when you guys get older
Itzjessietime your chanle is weird and gross
Sam Stringer just please don't say stuff like that because I could die if I get stressed out even more. the doctor even said to not get frustrated because I've been like this for too long. so please stop. and I get why your hating on logan but I don't want to get into any arguments. so how about we stop, botb of us. I'll stopbwacbing his vlogs and u stop hating on him and every thing will be fine
It's funny how all Western people think Japanese are polite and respectful, which is true, but it kinda feels like a stereotype at this point.
Fun fact, Japanese are in fact extremely discriminate against minorities, especially people with disability, that's why suicider goes to Aokihara forest, where people can't find their corpses.
A gRoWiNg Up ExPeRiEnCe
He is not bad
As a Asian, it's really hard for me to see some American doing these kid of stuff and actually getting likes and revenue, I'm not trying to be racist, but it just leave a bad taste in my mouth, as if young American think they can do whatever they want regardless which country they're in
You guys can't do anything bout people wanting to kill themselfs that's their desition, no matter what you do there is always people trying to bring others down...saying "Oh just ignore them"HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DO THAT?! WEN THEY'RE RIGHT THERE it's bs trying to ignore something that is always there..
He is NOT a star.
I saw this video
You dont get followers for youtube you grt subscriberd
"Fifteen million FOLLOWERS on Youtube."
Bitch, they're called subscribers. This ain't no Twitter!
This is dumb
Just fucking leave him alone ass holes he blured the face
How can you film, edit and release a video involving suicide when your target audience is young teens?
Shut the fuck up
Dont talk about Logan like that
we still love him
Subscribe find $500
Like date your crush 
Scroll 20 years of bad luck
LOGAN WHY ARE YOU STARTING  WORLD WAR 3 HUH
The beautiful beginning of 2018
And that's why I hate him now
"He has over Fifteen Million *followers* on youtube"
Uh huh yeah
Lol didn't  know you were capable of reporting real news
IzzyFzzy 
U dumbass 
They meant didnt
Its just a typo 
Stop being a smartass kid
Mike Thompson That sentence doesnt make sense. Try again.
I feel like its rude that he already has all the pressure and they have to put on the news like if you agree
You American news networks are a joke. You cannot even report on serious topics and issues as well as you used to.
I forgive him I like him I always will
Logan didn't post the video to raise awareness of suicide. He posted it because he thought he was the first person to find a dead body on YouTube. If he did it to raise awareness, he would have not shown the body and titled the video something else.
I hate login
You know he didn't mean to right?
Everyone just shut up! From all your dumb comments made him not make videos! And your all bad at keeping him in my life
well hes brainwashed
Good, as long as it gets him out of fame and you back into school
would you comment that if youre the family of the suicidal man?
good, i hope he deletes his channel
At 0:35 they say he has 15 million FOLLOWERS not SUBSCRIBERS you cant follow anyone on YouTube you only subscribe to people smh
how to make views.
Im smarter than you
No matter how hard we try these fucking 10 year olds are all with this humans make mistakes, we should just forgive him bullshit. No, unforgivable. The majority of his audience is kids for fucks sake.
0:34 Correction:he has 15.6 million subscribers on youtube*
CAN PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!
Holy duck lol.
NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ! LET LOGAN VLOG AND BE HIMSELG AND WE THE LOGANG WILL SUPPORT HIM THROUGH IN AND OUT ! THERE IS A BUNCH OF DEAD VICTIMS ON THE INTERNET ! MOVE ON ! LIKE tanner fox said !!
Ok, listen, he did it, he apologised, he deleted the video, and now you make a fucking video about this, I know, you guys are ABC News, but I dont give a shit. I personaly don't like Logan Paul's vlogs, but I do need to say that this was sooo unnecessary! Now it's just getting bigger, and the fact that you are doing this for view's too (yes, I do know what Im talking about, Im not stupid), In a way, and saying ''You do realise that your kids whatch this guy!'' Like, stop it, get some help you millioneer company!
Why you put that on the news i hate you guys
I hate logan
Juliana Martin we all do
This guy is such a douche.. before this scandal, and still is.
KristinM2288 Smh, IKR.
If no one called it out, he would not have apologized.
He was so disrespectful in Japan and to the public. Now he posts a dead body which was terrible. But what made it worse was he LAUGHED. He may be only 22. But he is an adult capable of making his own decisions. I feel like we should forgive him because everyone deserves to be forgiven and Im not trying to hate on him. But he was so disrespectful to the Japanese culture
Fuck u i love logan paul
JAKE PAUL WAS IN ABC NEWS TOO WOW
We all make mistakes!!!!
You guys how can you still like Logan if he is an ass hole why would he show a dead body if he knows that little kids watch him stupid ass hole FUCK YOU LOGAN PAUL like if you agree
I never watch this guy cause I never liked him
That was disrespectful to the victim and the family of him
I am DISGUSTED with Logan it's official I don't like either of the paul brothers or team ten!
i hate him now that was just meeeaaaannnnnn
That idiot logan paul
Why did he have to post that video
He said he was sorry and now he will not do videos
Im a kid and idc
The things is other ppl will make videos of suicide forests and nothing is wrong but when someone who is famous does it IT'S BAD LIKE THE FUCK?
Scumbag
OMG so disturbing
Dont be mean to logan if your mean to Logan and your in the logang then go fuck your self
HOW ABOUT Y'ALL SHUT THE FUCK UP AND I AIN'T SCARED OF NOTHING LOGAN PAUL MADE THAT YOUTUBE VIDEO TO SHOW US NOT TO SUICIDE HE WANTED TO SHOW US THAT SUICIDE IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO STOP BULLYING HE WANTED TO SHOW US THAT THERE IS SOMEONE FOR US THATS WHAT HE MENT! NOW HOW ABOUT Y'ALL HATERS GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE?! AND GET A LIFE BYE HATERS!! 
people will ruin a person life over nothing...as long as its not you
It looks like the woman was jelly of Logan Paul.
well i totely ander stend logan becose he is filming and then he find a death budy i mean hwo of you wudnt film it
as disgusting and cruel as video was i kind of feel bad for him ABC news ABCNEWS wow
Logang for life
Your fuck ed  up ABC news it was not his fuck in falt
F*** U
fuck you paul you are a trash fuck you bitch
Dude saw a dead body maybe for the first time,  he reaction is somewhat reasonable
Logan is so gay
He raised awareness by laughing at suicide... wow
I think the victim is fake
why is this news other than to tell parents to not let their kids watch this fucker
Logang were u at ! We got to defend his mistake . IT WAS JUST A FRICKEN MISTAKE .JERKS ITS A FRICKEN MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!
omg fuckkk this guy is disgusting
Aaron Paul should've called him a bitch Jesse style
Logan pau l is a price of trash for disrespecting and making a joke about it...it is just to disrespectful
Great job Logan great way to start off the f****** year
Oh look a greedy youtuber
He is insane ...
Gross
Taking this way too far and you dont understand the Japanese system if they have a big problem they either go missing forever will kill themselves which one do you want
Not cool
Ok so he made a mistake we all make a mistake we dont have to pass it on do yall really we dont we get it he did something wrong but he did not mean to do it just get over it we love him even tho he did that
I know I i apologize so sorry
no no 
And this is why it's such a big issue. I truly hope your friend gets better soon, I'm genuinely sorry he had to see that.
Sasha Vela stfu and he brain washes little kids like you into always being on his side no madder what he does FOR CHRIST SAKE HE MADE FUN OF A MAN WHO TOOK HIA OWN LIFE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT NO ONE LOVED HIM AND THAT HIS LIFE WAS MEANINGLESS SO YOU BEING  IDIOTIC SUPORTING HIM
JailerGaming I havent seen the vid but I didnt know he laughed at it
But why am I so pissed? And rude? Because children like you think what he did was okay. You'll grow up to find suicidal people to be the next punchline. "Oh he killed himself because he was abused by his parents, by other school kids and no one helped him even in work when he never gets free time, is all alone and so depressed that death was the only way out? Hahahahaha yeah maybe I should make that a meme".
As someone suicidal and someone who has nearly lost someone to suicide, I just hope you never have to go through the feeling. Cause then your fucked up, pathetic mind will see why we all hate him and what he did but you'll go down a dark path of regret. I only hope you don't understand why we all hate on him and his actions because you're trapped in a mind palace Logan created to be a perfect place of suicide being funny and murders being the next form of entertainment. Because once you leave your little bubble you'll be traumatised at how shit of a place this is, how shit of a person Logan is and how shit of a brat you honestly sound.
Stay in your bubble, sit down, shut up and research your Gods videos.
I'm sorry to whoever I might be offending but Why is everyone exactly mad at Logan Paul? I am not really a fan of him or Jake Paul but I personally think he did do anything wrong. What does he have to apologize for?? I would be upset with him if he found the dead body and made jokes about it because that's obviously not okay, but the forest he visited was a haunted place where it's more likely you run into someone that is more dead than alive, so I feel like we should all calm down about this because I don't see him acting like a asshole about any of this.
Never come to Japan again.
Shes actually right though. Hes only 22. Dont all young people make dumb mistakes? He obviously just didnt know any better.
 They do it in funerals.
Christopher White those are mostly just documented memes no one gives a shit about bruh, this guy actually was there and actually filmed a dead corpse
 you can't necessarily assume everything. He's human too I'm sure the dead guys feeling arnt hurt. Besides there are plenty of bigger issues out there such as the kkk. This is one silly video he made. Yet there are people like the kkk and Nazi and shit. Yet no one gives them shit.
I'm 17 and I know damn well that making a mockery out of the dead body of a suicide victim is wrong. In fact, all people, no matter how old they are, should be able to quite clearly distinguish the line between what's right and wrong in this situation. Then again, all Logan cares about is fame and revenue. He knew damn well that what he was doing was disgustingly out of line, but didn't give a single shit about it. He quite obviously doesn't care about his wrongdoing as long as he's benefitting from it in regards to his ego and money intake. And sure, he's young, but he's a fucking adult. He needs to realize that the world doesn't revolve around his conceited ass for once.
What a disgrace, that 'man' is. He isn't sorry, he posted anyway. Since when did suicide fall under the guise of 'entertainment ' ??????
Never heard of him...but obviously an idiot with no conscience .
Did he expect good reactions?!!! I know 11 year olds who watch his videos, and this is what he's showing them!! WTF!!
Hateing
Thanks for not hate ING
Shut down logan paul!
Suicide prevention my ass. Making jokes about a HANGING BODY is not suicide prevention awareness. It fucking idiotic
We dont consider him one of ours we dont want him hes a disease and we are so annoyed hes here...
Wtf why you do give a fuck to this its ok he is crazy killed him self
White people in a nutshell
I am Logan Paul's biological father !!! I finally respond to his controversy *trigger warning*
Noooooooooooo
People are mean to logan just stop it if you are one of them how would you feel or do if you were in his shoes or if that was really you
No matter what any reason The US immigration make stop enter into US like if some Japanese just have record of entered to many country sometimes, so Japanese immigration also must be strict against him. The videois showing his character and personality what he is, thats very strong evidence.
He stayed in Japan for a couple days and all he did there are bullshit..
I say forgive himit was just a mistake
wtf, this is a fake
In the full video you can see the security guy saying his line instant, pretty much stutter? The emotional ending, the fake sidekick's comment about not feeling good? This guy needs very much attention to be living...
and the body could be just a puppet, theoreticaly this is an international black dot for Japan.
EVERY ONE MAEKS MASTAEKS
He has 15 mil subs not followers
He knows what he's doing. Just like trump being disliked gets more attention then being liked
Lets not forget Logan Paul is only twenty two Im sure everyone has made a mistake at his age and regretted it and wanted to take it back he made one mistake but shouldnt he get a second chance
He has 15 mil followers on YouTube
Right now Im cringing lol its called subscribers old people  go on-

Oh wow and now its on the news?  omgg seriously this is so stupid yall are just going to gain him views and shit which he doesnt deserve. Stoppp
He's ugly. Super super ugly, inside and out ...
"Top trend on Twitter" on the fucking news I swear this dam generation
He is a fucked up person
Donald Trump or Logan Paul either way we're still fucked
He didn't mean too..... He never seen a dead body before.
logang for life still
it's not his fault
it's not his
Dude just by watching a couple of his vids... I can tell he is an absolute selfish and inconsiderate person.. and THIS... is just despicable.. to say the least
fuck this nigga
Logan who?
Lol he only has 15 mil. PewDiePie has 50 mil. We need more pewdiepie stuff. Fuck this guy
ImTaking TheL what?
Look he apologized so if you are still mad STOP he understands what he did was wrong.
-Mallory Myers
aa  noooo! don't do my fav vlogger that!!
logan paul ... you suck
and i thought 2018 would go off to a good start..,
It is
+MoonWolfx  RIGHT?! NOW his brother Jack or whatever needs to do a similar retarded thing so theyre both removed from Google Preferred AND have their YouTube accounts removed.
XxJohnPlayzxX u little jake pauler
Carlos Lopez The original vid got deleted by the family of the victim they forced him to delete the video
MoonWolfx it is a good start bc I heard that his channel is getting deleted by YouTube
Why did he even do this he had time to edit it and couldve deleted it  he said sorry but did he say sorry because it kinda ruined his career or because he truly was sorry
Leve him alone
PERMABAN IS BUTT
Fuck you guys you can suke a dixk
this is a growing up experience ... that needs to be WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! He literally showed and mocked a dead person. He is a narcissist, a racist and a dumb ass mofu so stop excusing his stupid behavior!!
you are right chizzy
He's the epitome of a "bro"... right?
Yup you guys heard it right. 15 million FOLLOWERS on youtube
People need to stop bitching. People die no matter what. Logan paul should not laugh. We don't know if it was real or fake. Can wait to see suicide be the #1 death in the world. *drinks the tears of the triggered* good why to kick-off 2018 https://youtu.be/RyCUC6fsaBU i am not siding with anybody with this stupidity. Not even dumbass celebrity.
Totally weird but i like his hat
I don't see why this is so special. White people do shit like this all the time. This must be some illuminati humiliation ritual or something to that extent and his subscribers have ironically increased over 300k since this backlash...
I hate how ppl make drama out of everything, Logan Paul did something that probably million of people did but because he's famous everybody starts scandalizing it. Im sure 99% of you told once a offensive joke once or did something similar.
Btw im not supporting logan im criticizing the news.
yeah that is actually YouTube's major fail...they actually viewed the video and not only did they pass it but passed it WITHOUT age restrictions ...there must be some major money being exchanged on covering up YT fail.
but hes a kid friendly a KID friendly channel should not showed a stuff that only an adult can comprehend
there's a difference between making an offensive joke and filming a dead body. there's a huge difference.
ah ok i get what you mean :)
nguyen custom what I mean is that actually there are million of worse things happening now and ppl stay with a stupidity someone has done and  make it look like the end of the world.
Followers?
LOGAN SUCK DICK HARD I HATE LOGAN #JAKEPAUL4LIFE
Logan post
Not sure why this is even happening in the first place, we're the idiots who made him famous to begin with.
Come on people give Logan Paul a break.
Im an 11 year old which is pretty much the age range of Logan Paul's viewers, I mean he already makes me cringe enough and I honestly already hate him. But him doing anything like this crosses the line. I mean, I have much respect for Japan and Japan itself is wonderful (already seeing him in japan is pretty cringy and embarrassing like seriously) and I have no problem with people going into the ''Suicide Forest'' for a visit as long as they are safe human beings, but how would you feel if you decided to take your fucking life away and someone visited your death and showed it on camera? Disrespect. And I mean thats not only disrespectful to Japan but to the persons family. And we get the message that Suicide is wrong and I agree with Logan Paul, that is wrong, but I swear to god. 
How can you just stand there and be like ""oh my god I cant believe it!" 
I mean he apologized and thats very mature of him, but we will all know what he did and that will have impact on him this year, hopefully by the end of 2018 he has learned his lesson
I swear to jesus christ get me a glass of water im done
STEPPING WESTWARD
While my Fellow-traveller and I were walking by the side of
Loch Ketterine, one fine evening after sun-set, in our
road to a Hut where in the course of our Tour we had
been hospitably entertained some weeks before, we met,
in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region,
two well dressed Women, one of whom said to us, by
way of greeting, "What you are stepping westward?"
"What you are stepping westward?"--"Yea."
--'Twould be a wildish destiny,
If we, who thus together roam
In a strange Land, and far from home,
Were in this place the guests of Chance:
Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,
Though home or shelter he had none,
With such a Sky to lead him on?
The dewy ground was dark and cold;
Behind, all gloomy to behold;
And stepping westward seem'd to be
A kind of _heavenly_ destiny;
I liked the greeting; 'twas a sound
Of something without place or bound;
And seem'd to give me spiritual right
To travel through that region bright.
The voice was soft, and she who spake
Was walking by her native Lake:
The salutation had to me
The very sound of courtesy:
It's power was felt; and while my eye
Was fixed upon the glowing sky,
The echo of the voice enwrought
A human sweetness with the thought
Of travelling through the world that lay
Before me in my endless way
if he didn't do it for views he would have just spoke about the experience not shown it. He's so disconnected and needs to do some work on himself yo.  Maybe get off the internet for a long time to find out what real life really is. Get off the endorphin addiction train to getting likes.
i am not in the logang anymore i seen the video before it got removed no hate to him but he should have thought he would,nt like it if millions of people seen him dead in a forest just why logan just why
we all know dead don't feel disgrace that why took his own life quote his own life. why even care if he took video of a dead person. her or him took his own life we all know he couldn't handle life this what happens when people stupid enough to consider suicide in the first place
https://www.change.org/p/youtube-delete-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel with your help of signing this petition it could lead to deleting his entire channel!
OMG WHAT ITS ON ABC
"15 Million Followers." Hell no I ain't even a subscriber.
IT'S EVEN ON THE DAMN NEWS!!
*Why oh whYhYyYY*
WTF fuck you it was a mistake bith
Im not try to against suicide free but omg please Ive seen so many you tubers say that on their titles
He is a dirty thing
this shit got to ABC? wow.
if you have ever watched his videos how disrespectful, stupid, weird they are it really makes you wonder about this millennial society since he has 15m followers. WTF has happened to society ? There is a point even when young you know right from wrong. This is current day. This is what is considered entertainment. Sheeple just follow. This generation is so disappointing
Its all lies dont Listen to the news listen to the person who made the video
He's such a lying bullshitter.
By showing a dead body was gonna cause this big positive suicide prevention? Right..
" I didn't do I for the views" *UH* yeah he did. He always says " I'll do anything for the views" This guy is some bullshit.
I feel like Logan is a good person and didnt mean it
Aletia Slessor *how and stfu you brainwashed 10 year old
Caleb Guava Dude *hear
Caleb Guava Dude didnt mean it? He films a dead body, disrespects the countries culture and the dead body. Stupid brainwashed 10 year olds.
I feel that you should delete your channel and so should logan
Aletia Slessor you're* and how*. And once again, the Paul brothers' rabid fans don't fail to impress me with their semi-remarkable consistency to use terrible grammar. Oh, and in reply to your question: my statement makes me feel like a rational thinking human being. Thanks for asking :)
POEPLE WHO HATE LOGAN BECAUSE OF THE FACT HE POSTED A MISTAKEN VIDEO. That's pathetic ok he they didn't know how to react when they saw the dead body. Everyone makes mistakes like we do. So don't say in his videos OMG u totally just do those un thoughtful videos for views. The thing is he is not if u watch the video he named "so sorry" you will know the reason why he reacted the way that he did. Half of the reason he didn't know how to react was because he didn't see a dead body ever in his life. And that this was the first dead body he seen. Go on his channel his last video he posted was 5 days ago called "so sorry" he said why he reacted the way he did. And the apologies he did. Am grate ful he apologized for his mistake he did. Dont be so mean because he did a mistake 
He did a mistake dont we? 
( sorry if u think this comment is rude. Its really not it is just something i picked on while i was researching why he did that. And i did this comment so i can prove everyone it was just a mistake and everyone does mistakes. Even though there was a dead body. Aleast he said sorry. But know he has the depression right now to not make videos. Thank u for reading if u did)
Leave logan paul alone plz
Is he going to make athor video
Why dont yall get over yourself like dang Logan made a mistake we are human and humans make mistakes
Shock jockey, he's only doing it to get views, shock the world, people bought into the hype and now they're all high and mighty. Wow.
Everyone Macks mistakes
This vid are funny
Who care's that logan drive 250 k  Dollar vehicle
You messing up my shingles no way you messing up my mind
YouTube star? No its a YouTube jackass
And how can you take the damn news seriously when they dont know the fucking difference between followers and subscribers
What he did was wrong but damn he was trying to help by spreading suicide prevention and shit but the people have still like to keep on aging even when he said he was sorry damn what about all the other people who did wrong and then all the people are like HOLY SHIT LOOK WHAT LOGAN PAUL DONE you have to expect shit in life and if you dont like him why waste time on commenting stuff about Him and this is my opinion and idgaf what people think about it yall can keep your opinions to yourself
get rid of him
he is an Embarrassment to mankind
Logang4life
Something wrong in your head.. Do you think its funny? You're really sick !
Im not a fan of Logan Paul but in my opinion he didnt do nothing wrong.
I wanna see the dead body! I'm curious!
lmao i always hated him
He was just doing things he want to do..he dont know what is going to happend ? I mean you did something that you shouldn't do right ? HE WAS JUST RECORDING OFCOURSE YOU KIDS NOW HIM !?!? MAYBE THEY ARE A FAN OF HIM ! AND NOW HES STOPPING BECUZ OF THIS LIKE !?! ALL OF HIS FANS WILL BE GOING ON A BREAKDOWN ! AND MAYBE EVEN SOME WILL LIKE STALK YOU ! OR EVEN MURDER YOU OF THIS ?

Ok Im over it,Hes young and dumb and also a man.i also agree he said he didnt do this for views,WHY WOULD HE PUT I found a dead body in the suicide forest FOR THE TITTLE AND THUMBNAIL.
Who cares holy fuck all yall so fucking dramatic leave the man alone!!!
Boy you cant have followers on youtube
"HE HAS 15MILLION FOLLOWERS IN YOUTUBE"
If u want to intend a suicide prevention or whatsoever, dude, learn how to fucking respect people! If u don't know what respect is, google it.
COME BACK LOGAN
I'm and old fuck and don't much give a rats ass about logan Shmogan. I think people who put a quarter inch of makeup on and read for a living ought to not be jealous of some punk kid.  Can you overpaid nobodies find some real GD news?  "a youtuber went in the woods,found a dead body and filmed it and is just so mean and he has an expensive CARRRRR"!  Waaaaaahhh WAAAHHH! Get over yourselves you mindless robots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EXv89uYFbI
"15 mil followers" seriously
Please dont call him star
I actually like the concluding statement. "This is a growing up experience." Yeah, guys. He made a mistake. A terrible mistake, but that happens. He didn't kill anyone, he didn't intend to harm anyone. Words hurt... some actions hurt too... he spoke and acted before he thought it through. That happens. He's 22 - that's practically a child nowadays. So yes, it is a growing up experience. Unfortunately, it happened in front of the whole world. But I'm pretty sure there's tons of guys like him out there who can be forgiven just because they only did something like this in front of a few people.
Why is it call suicide forest
Movement Far East 
Dang this is serious 
he is a star ?? I thought he is a joker
STOP HATING ON HIM
#SaveLoganPaul!!
Suicide prevention? I dont think so
Did not mean to do that
Nobody wants you to be alive or back
Itzbender420, he means that we Japanese people don't want him in our country anymore. You can understand, right?

Logan can just tell the viewers about this and tell the story as an story time then he can beg for funds and awareness and he has millions so he could donate as well
Ohh nooooo LOGAN WHHYYYYYY
Because he's a sociopath
I know
U suck
This is why suicide isnt allowed on the media
Well, well - if you are very popular, your bad reputation spreads with the speed of lightening. Serves him just right!
FUCK OFF HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO
I hope people wake up now and look up to the right model and not someone dumb. Our society is getting dumber..I hope it doesn't go down hill any farther....
U and I both know login paul is a moron but you bont have to take his channel bown he is my favorite youtuder and he keep so many people happy i mean his videos have helped me through some hard times and he has helped going on the hole out on a smile and a show for years and he has always lapped a smile on my face even on some of my darkest days and yes you so may call me stupid for writing this but login paul did say sorry and he did mean it he really is not all that bad of a guy so please just stop it and let us all move on like we buy with the hole 9/11 and every thing else yes 9/11 was a horrible time but we have times like this in our world and I have seen watching login paul Diana's i was 5years old i am now 11 years old and still to this day love login paul vlogs and I will always be the binder 1 loganster so please leave login paul alone he did pull a really stupid move and all but he is a great smart some times stupid person but he really is a great guy and great your user
Pretty disappointing im a logangster before but now i unsub to him
Young people are watching this logan... You need to think about other people. Stop just thinking about yourself. People are watching this and thinking... Oh i want to be just like jake paul! hes so cool and all. Just no. Jake shouldnt be a hero to anyone at this point.
He did a mistake like you never did a mistake in your life but if you did not did a mistake you are not living life
I thought the vid was clickbait so I didn't watch it
Please
Please
Please
Please
What did this guy expect when going into a forest called 'Suicide Forest'?
Logan Paul is a stupid idiot. 
has no clue how damaging was this presentation
alledgedly???? 
On the first fucking week of 2018-
#LowLifeGang
de way 4 who me ? If it is I'm sorry
fuck you
Meme Star IM STILL APART OF THE LOGANG 
Meme Star #GO_TO_HELL_LOGAN
Followers? Don't you mean subscribers? What the fuck?
Logan :"I didn't do it for views"
no kids watch logan paul and also jake paul THEY SUX
Logan Paul is a dickHead
15 million *followers* Oh so we calling subscribers followers now.
fucc off locunt
Pretty easy to see who the kids are in the comments haha! Usually have very bad logic and reasons for forgiving their idol.
Im SHOOK
Who raised this plank! His parents must be proud! As someone who has lost someone from suicide this is disgusting.
This is the guy that said Usain Bolt looked like a big starving African child.
I am 9 years old
I am shocked dude
Aww thats messed up
the video that made everyone a bunch of soft little b*tches
this guy will make a lot of views on any other clip..Not just on " suicide video "...he do a great job. That's the deal..And yeah..maybe to post on yt the suicide clip wasn't the best ideea ever..but still...He's Logan Paul.He can handle it...and btw..F O L L O W E R S..NOT SUBSCRIBERS...FOLLOWERS
He did it for views
HE DIDENT KNOW THAT THERE WAS GOUNG TO NE SOMEONE DEAD OK DOMT ASUME THINGS JEEZ PPL ARE IDIOTS
Yeh. He could have left it out.
Why should I believe something solely because someone said it? Fuck off kid.
Not monetized
Maya Colon he had a fucking tour guide, and anyone in their right mind would turn off the camera when they see the body and not film it! Its extremely disrespectful. Imagine you died and someone came, recorded you and joked about you. How would you as a soul feel about that, watching someone make fun of your dead body while you stand there watching...
Usless
logan rocks you by suck
Logan paul You are an idiot. Hope you lose your endorsements
as this guy laughed the hole time and talked crap, to put it nicely! It wasnt allegedly showing a body, HE DID.............
#FuckYouLoganPaul
Let's see how many triggered kids will respond to this.
logan is gonna get a lot of hates  but he deserves em after that dont defend you know what he did was wrong
LOGAN PAUL RULES! REGARDLESS!!
How does he think that he will raise an awareness of suicide if hes making fun of the body and laughing?
Cancerer
On an completely unrelated note, why do any type of media go out of their way to not use the correct terms for stuff? its 2018, you should know that youtubes "hits" and "followers" are Views and SUSCRIBERS
How did Logan Paul use monsoon that's a big word for him 
I *KNEW* this was coming. It was written in the stars by the Mayans. *THE END OF THE WORLD*
If he had really wanted to raise awareness of suicide prevention he wouldnt have made it into a fucking joke! What a fucking tit!
We don't need the mainstream media to report this, thank you.
Presenting ladys and gentlemen...exhibit "A" Americas Mental Health Issue
You guys didn't show the body! There is a suicide that happened also did you look at his other videos in Japan were he was being a jerk to people there?!
Great thing logan did it, or else the family would never have found the dead body or the police would have never case that file,why the person sucide...... thanks logan bring justice to the person,,, logan4life
People are making such a bid deal, people need to grow up
because you know growing up has to do with recording a dead guy.
He's like YouTube's Donald Trump.
He didn't even mean to see that.
*logan founds body and people gets disgusted even though he did nothing*
Yall are making Logan feel so bad for his family hes hasnt post in five days Im his 
 because then youre just horrible people
she says 15 mil followers its 15 mil subs
Cant Believe this Idiots Go To those places to disrespect others with their Stupidity..
I honestly dont think he deserves hate but he shouldnt be liked. I never even liked him in the first place
Media does that all the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...and worse
0:34 its SUBSCRIBERS 
i think he is fake
I bet you people know what he drives and probably more the news people are pretty much stalkers with a camera creeps
The only people standing up to Logan are kids oml I don't want to live on this Earth because of dumb shit like this. Your idol makes fun of a person dying and you're gonna go ahead and say your idol made a mistake?! it depends on whoever it is but Logan seems like he can manipulate people. I hate this generation. #rant
NEVER COME BACK
STOP taiking ABOUT Logan HE WAS SORRY SO JUST STOP 
Cool, glad to know if I step on your favorite doll and said sorry everything is all good.
How can I get attention? Hmmm...
Will he f**h up
Depuis quand que les poste de tlvision parle de drama sur YouTube. ABC News are you that desperate.
Oh, I thought he suicide...
It's me Kristina your english committed suicide
Bummer
oh i wish
i wish
Dont hate on Logan Paul people make mistake It might be a big one but everybody has made a mistake and a big one
The Paul brothers have become evil and a nuisance
subscribe to me
Puts click bait title, "I didn't do it for views." Like who tf gonna believe you
white boy
Its called subscribers not followers
Then look at the quotation marks at the end
People do not call subs fucking followers
The hell
Idiot!
Fuck you
Now I know where not to kill myself...
What Logan did was wrong, Im not hating on him, but Im not supporting him either. How could the video be trending if it was illegal? Some shady stuff is going on on YouTube.  Also, people need to get over it, Logan made a mistake, we all do.
people would be more interested on  illegal contents thats why they watched it in the first place and shouldnt you be proud of that since people are aware of what hes doing
MystikAura why don't people hate on the kkk as much as they do this guy?  There are much worse problems and videos out there than this guy common get serious this isn't that mind-blowing
I can agree there's a civil way to go about this, but let's be real here, Logan has made more than just one mistake and tbh this wasn't a mistake if you knew full well what you were doing. He didn't have to upload the video, he didn't have to keep the body in it, and he also didn't have to mock and make fun of the japanese culture while he was in japan. Eating someone's pie they saved for after work is a mistake, but what he did was not considered a mistake, it goes well beyond that term altogether
Reporter : He has *15M followers* on youtube
Me: You mean *15M subscribers*
Edit: Thanks for the likes. I do believe I never said it does matter. Calm your farm guys as it is only a comment, so don't get all worked up. *Followers and Subscribers may be the same thing in your opinion, but this is my opinion.* Got a problem? *GO SOMEWHERE ELSE RATHER THAN LEAVING A RUDE COMMENT*
a light's dream to explain to these morons to ignore this and not leave a little snitchy comment
Bloxyrhys is fun at least we have some people with a brain and actually kind like you in this world
ImDisgustedLookingAtThis UnbelievablyFakeJunk don't say that because you can trigger someone thinking thoughts like that.  Don't be a baby and get all annoyed over a tiny comment.  Go fck yourself
Its the same thing fool
Charlotte Games its the same thing
Cant stand ABCs patronizing concern. The only awareness this tool was raising was for himself.
I wanna beat the shit outta this fuck! Pos
"Mistake" my ass. You don't take a photo of you reacting in this way in the Suicide Forest and then upload it online to your millions of followers by mistake. He never gave a shit until he got shit and now suddenly he's so aware of how wrong it is. Men like this can be blamed for why the younger generation is becoming increasingly more immature. Their role models are awful and are twice their age, they think they're inspirational.
For all the people who been hatin on Logan he made a mistake every humman does and anyone who sees this has and most of the people who been hatin on him probably don't even watch his vlogs therefore they don't have a clue so they need to shut the fuck up
The hell u mean bye FOLLOWERS
It's life, why dwell on such a irrelevant video and it's just life.
AND WE THOUGHT JAKE WAS DUMB......
Pfft I ain't no Logangster no more and no one can convince me like I haven't see anything so stupid since 2017 xD
That was a good move
Shutup u guys suck stop saying bad things about logan you read his text he said he is sorry
I need yalls choice I got the Maverick Logan Paul BackPack  tomorrow I have school and I really want to take it to school but Im afraid that people would say stuff and tell me negative stuff should I take it to school or no ? I support him 
Go sub to me
Best day everrrrrrrrrrrrrr By: Sponge Bob
Fuck the body bitch
I really don't see the actual issue her.
Wow Logan just wow...
Kids are fucking lame as hell nowadays.
He is just a human being. EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES. Yes I know that was fucked up for what he did, but at least he knew it was wrong and he deleted the video and apologized. And for that people should stop bringing more and more hate! Just my opinion.
*EgLanD iS mY cItY*
Followers ITS SUBSCRIBERS
There are tons of suicide clips on youtube uncensored and many videos with deceased bodys too, many big youtubers making light of suicide and then this clusterfuck happens and then peaple decide suicide is a big deal? Then again the next time some psychopath with a gun kills some women and children all the new crews will race for the goriest details, peaple will mourn,  the government will rush for a scapegoat, and then the news caster's will show the audience what they came for, the blood. Suicide once happened to a friend of mine and for 3 weeks the school was taboo on suicide jokes, then they started up again, the news featured him for awhile before the deaths of more peaple happend, now everytime I turn the tv on all I see is death, qnd how the world has failed to truly care about who the peron was and how now a days they just wanna know when, where qnd how it happened.  And when you are about to die just remember that the only real legacy you leave is fractured memories, hurt feelings and compost for plants.
ProzSkilLz Don't humans profit off of each other? I honestly don't care about suicide so I never really cared about the video.
It's also that his audience is definitely not mature enough to see this kinda stuff... kids eventually come into contact with adult issues but this is a bad way to do it
well there are ton but how many of them shows some dumbfuck cracking up joke about suicide and such? By the way dont forget about his audience base viewer number are those channels u speak of have that? btw are also an idiot? They're news channels its what they do and their competitor are 2 too many to count how are you gonna afloat your business in that niche market huh? Lets just admit he fucked up big time flew too close to sun and burned his feather now it not about apologizing its about  his survival on youtube and any other platform and lets hope this youngman pulls out and wise up. So there is you answer instead of defending that moron by adding flammables to flame go donate 1$ to suicide prevention centers!
but this guy have 115 million subscribers and majority of them are kids i know that you might not be affected as much but people like you are rare once on my school one boy fell from the stairs minor injuries but theres a blood guess who go to a hospital a girl that was walking by and saw blood and passed bang her head to the stair major injuries and moved out from the school and granted not a lot of people is like her but seeing someone DEAD and some people laughing like wtf how would the family of the person reacts they will be mad since a tourist used their family member who commited SUICIDE for money
That was deep

so what the dummy killed himself who cares who saw the body
You mean "YouTube star"
He was on abc what
Followers on YouTube. girl what we have subscribers where you from?
I think she don't know YouTube she on Instagram all day
The news reaction is trash too.they kind of underplayed what he did.trash news
Why can't everyone just understand that NO ONE IN THIS FUCKING WORLD is perfect. I'm not defending Logan but just get it through your tiny brains of yours that no one is perfect. It wasn't right that he posted that video but he apologized and those actors had no fucking right to call him names. Again I'm not defending Logan and I do watch him and I am 16 years old , old enough to understand what he did was wrong. Have a nice day everyone.
I stand for logan paul
I had watched the video and next time I entered his channel he deleted it
fuck u
So disrespectful ! He did this for views sick fuck !
YouTube should suspend his account and end monetization!! Positivity my ass u did this for views and laughed about it u sick ass kid
Guys I truly think Logan means well from how long we have known him do u really think he would do somthing as stupid as that and still he is a nice guy he is always positive he said he is sorry what else do u want from him his life cause if this is the society we r living in I don't want to be in it so I forgive him and if u don't screw u
YouTube is a very odd and concerning place as of now. It used to be golden, and now it's trash. There's one controversial story after another.
The Paul brothers (or as I call them, the devilish duo), has started controversy since Jake Paul became more and more noticed, releasing his song for, "It's Everyday Bro", with him and his brother constantly fighting and dissing each other. Youtube is now war.
Logan Paul has a better rep than Jake Paul, but this time, he really screwed up. Why on this earth would you laugh and take selfies with a dead body? A DEAD BODY!!! How do you raise suicide awareness by taking selfies with an actual dead body!?! He did it for the ad revenue. That shows how crazy people could go just for a couple of bucks.
I can't even enjoy YouTube on the popular side, ever since the Viners moved in. 2017, good riddance!!!!!!
Do not hate Logan
Apparent suicide victim? There was literally footage of the dead body in the suicide forest. Quit sugarcoating this atrocity.

How does the name make it any different? Following someone on Twitter gives you updates on their posts.
Subscribing to someone on YouTube gives you updates to their po- Wait, - I just said this! Maybe it's because they're... SYNONYMOUS. Don't be a grammar nazi since they mean the same thing.
ITS NOT SAME THING.    YOUTUBE HAS SUBS.  THE FAKE MEME SITES HAVE FOLLOWERS.    SO IN THIS CASE ITS. NOT. THE. SAME.
they do they same thing? On other social media the follow/subscribe button are pretty synonymous. It lets you get updates on what someone posts.
#TRIGGERED
idgaf about Logan paul but what amerikkka whites is not finn do is sit up here and bash him when whites laugh a hung bodies everyday in the usa. past and present yall always laughed what so different now cause he rich.
followers on youtube.. im sorry this is nothing to laugh about Logan Paul should be BANNED
DANG MAN!

Waths the matter
Im a logangster
The pauls brothers are fucked youtube and the community hates them oh well its there fault
it looks like the body feet was touching the ground. is it just me?
My cousins told me this and they showed me it on there history because it's deleted
your cousins have some balls showing there history.
My Reaction: *OoF*
How is he supposed to stop it when he made jokes about it
Oh shit Australian broadcasting centre getting in on this, this is serious considering Logan is American and he went to Japan!
EDIT: if he is also trying to raise awareness why the fuck did he giggle at the body! the poor man who probably went into deep depression to then get laughed at after being shown hanged.
What he did in Japan was really disrespectful. Not just showing the dead body on his vlog but the overall actions he did there.
You guy don't have to judge for what he has done at least he apologized GOD IDIOTS STUPID PEOPlE
Career Suicide
Kelly Vonsweetz i
Alraune666 In a way, it is. There's a lot of backlash over his video. Although I agree humor is a way to cope, and I don't know the limits either on where I should stop, I know that posting up a video with a corpse is never a good idea. It would also help his case if he edited that out or took the police out to recover the body and just made a statement, but this guy is just some jackass that gets views for being one. In a way, it is career suicide. He made the choice to post the video intentionally, and knew that there could be a backlash over it. Posted anyway. 
Yeah, there are worse things out there, but most can't handle even this, and that is the world we must please for some reason. I don't understand the whole ceremony aspect of death either. We hold tombs and burials sacred, when we don't even remember past our own grand or great grand parents. Even that is choppy for most. We honor the memory of the lives lived, but in 3 generations that memory is lost. There's no point, really. Anyway, the guy is a douche. Period. That's all I got to say
KostisPlayz - Minecraft
 *You
Umm......yeah minecraft.....if it wasn't a serious comment, there would be "lolz" included. 
It is, in a way, poetic justice that an asshat would go to a location known for suicides and be stupid enough to record someone dead for ratings. He may state he was trying to raise awareness, but that's a lie. He shows constant disregard for those around him, law, and customs of whatever country or culture he's in. He could have shown the police the footage, helped them find the body for removal, and include that OR just not upload that section of footage and just talk about it later on, but no....he didn't. 
My comment isn't made in bad taste or in comical whim, so let's point out the reason you're here. You saw the first comment but couldn't think of a way to comment, so you found the only reply to worm your way on here, which is to show some hint of disgust at a comment of irony between death of life vs death of career living. If there really is an issue with my remark, state it. "Really dude U serious?" just doesn't convey what your issue is. Since there shouldn't be an issue over a neutral comment, one has to inquire why you remarked at all.
Really dude?
U serious?
You guys are men login is a sweet guy and he didnt men that he said he is sorry and he tied all the people that had seen it do not want he said he is so sorry and he is a angel
SirPoptarts 
just because logan apologise that doesnt mean its still ok just like what dannielle bregoli said
Jayla Simmons fuck dude go learn how to spell then come back.
Your "sweet guy" has just broken one of youtubes major guidelines.  As well as showing a clear disregard for the dead.( A  person who committed suicide )  I don't know him personally but the way he came off to me in the video was immature. When dealing with serious topics such as suicide you have to take a cautious approach.  filming a dead body is a clear violation of the guidelines and calls for strict punishment. Terminating his channel or putting a strike is justifed.
I'm not a man. We're not all men. Yes we're logged in, so we don't have to Login again. And Logan tied all the people? What? Where? Don't tell me he tied them in that forest just so he can film them for views. He's an angel? Then I must be God.
Logan paul probably woulded be filming Jake pauls dead body when he's dies
Not only does Logan Paul need to be held responsible but this should be a eye opener for parents to monitor what their children are watching because his demographic is children he gives a bad name to hard working role model worthy youtubers and YouTube as a whole
If he intended for the video to raise suicide awareness, he could have:
1) respected the guy who killed himself a little more 
2) put a clip at the end stating why he put the video up
And maybe 3) not have monetized the video (not sure if he actually did)
Someone explain to me what is so bad about him posting the video plzz
One of the best explanations came from this Japanese YouTuber https://youtu.be/UuJ09HN4JO4 ... Hope it helps.
he laughed at a person commiting suicide
I watched that video
If you can forgive him for this and you can't forgive Jake paul for kicking some one out of team ten then you are so stupid
threre just  haters
He was just smiling Because he that he was getting pranked
Hes relevant now. He loves this
Sign this petition to remove his channel, copy and paste to make sure of it https://www.change.org/p/youtube-delete-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel?recruiter=801404782&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.undefined
come on its not a big deal  its like he did men it or like he did on purpose
are you retarded? he had to record the person then go edit it and decide if he wanted the dead person in the footage and thought it was a good idea yea he did it on purpose
Why would you post it on your channel he all ready has hate now your fans can hate on him to i want this video removed please
he deserve to be in jail for this.
Im not even aloud to watch Logan Paul anymore
If only Aaron called him a bitch.
Bro that just broke my heart
I get he apologised, but the thing that most people are mad about is that he *LAUGHED*
 15 million followers on YouTube you mean subscribers*?
You messed up logen i yused to. Love watching you 
Stop looking at the past and move on bitchs he just made a mistake everyone does but you have to let things go and people are just so negative he said sorry and he might end his carrier
but its no ones business to end his carrier move on from the past.
*HE DIDNT SHOW THE FUCLING FACE D:<*
I WENT TO THAT PLACE THE DAY BEFORE HE DID WTFFFFF
#fuckdonaldtrump
hey ABC news fuck you! yee!
Logan Paul hey, we all forgive you, well I do anyway, you messed up, so? Just don't do it again, I personally am a big fan and I wouldn't unsubscribe just cause you made a stupid mistake, now just let us forget this ever happened yeah?

FAKE PERSON
Fuck yall!! Ima jakepauler and I say this. He made a huge mistake. Hate on him but dont say he should kill his dumb ass. He is dumb but hes gonna end up making a dis on himself and yall will love him again.
 THE END
Let me tell you a story about why I have the Paul brothers
Ok so I was watching bisarvark and I fell in love with jake but not love like he was awesome I wanted to be his best friend but then my friend said that why do you like him hes a jerk and I said thats so not true but then after watching Logans and Jakes vids and I hated this and jake and Logan are b$&@es
No wonder why I hate him..
Look at those glasses lol 0:35
the fact that they said followers on youtube
www.supportloganpaul.com
OH NO....
*bullshit*
Fuck this bullshit if you were a fan of Logan and you stopped likening him BC of that you fucked up
Youtube is a slave to the Paul brothers, that's why his channel has not been taken down or even received a strike. Other creators are getting strikes for a misdemeanor. #boycottloganpaul
Who else saw the vid before it was deleted?
#makebetterdecisions
...Not a good start to 2018.
Did she say 15 million followers on youtube
Shuch up
so your saying not 2 watch Logan Paul cuz your like you may not know your kids are watching him ..Logan Paul a hole lot of people love him and a lot of parents like him I'm so efended of what u said all so like Logan said he was sorry and he would Chang he made a 1 min video say he would Chang I'm not going 2 fuking sub 2 y'all you guys suck

prayforloganpaul and ssundee
Man Logan Paul is amazing
Destroy logan Paul
I know he did something roung but you have his personality all roung he is.a good guy
OMG people make mistakes that video is gone move on
Best Boss what if youre the family of the suicide guy you would obviously be mad look at both of the fucking sides first dumb fuck
ShyGuy2005 how bout you focus on real problems like global warming the kkk racists and Nazi's and terrorists. Not some dead guys feelings.
His video was wrong but there are my CNN worse shit out there get your priorities correct. No asks the kkk to say sorry. No one ask the president when they bomb innocent civilians in Pakistan to say sorry
Best Boss https://youtu.be/0doSWS0Fj24
If millions of others have moved on..then why is this video here and why is it still such a big deal and controversy?
ShyGuy2005 actually you can I did and so did millions of others
Its called subscribers
No please don't fire him please
Bro hes not even that popular there is tons more people that have more subsribers
Login. Pol
Can anyone link that video with the corpse
That is suicide right these are stupid that their live just 1 and they just kill them I think they idiots
he got in trouble for showing a dead body and then apologized and yet he's still in trouble
Hmm? Followers on youtube? These people are dumb lol!
Why the fuck is there 7k dislikes?
Its not his fault why the fuck is something called the suicide forest open to the public?
He recorded the footage and then had to edit it. He decided he wanted to show the dead person in the footage. It is his fault.
i am on logans side. i completely understand for posting it for suicide awareness. he was just trying to do something good, and people just hated him for it, and still hate him right now. its just stupid.
what being mean boy
Wher can I still find this video?
People take suicide to seriously.  What's worse Logan uploaded his real reaction to a dead body or the people who are fake outraged about it. I'm sure that some people are really upset but. some people get really triggered by the topic.
I feel bad for him because he went to 15million to 3million subscribers
It is unfortunate that children see forest suicide
I did not know you could get followers on YouTube
That's it I'm unsubscribing to your channel
I'm shocked I'm surprised you did this and I'm Japanese I'm not seeing your face again
Just get lost never go to our place again
Stop it was a week ago
Ok 2018 is the worst already
all i can say is that is one proof of the Trump effect.... you can say and do whatever you want not even caring if it is negative and very insensitive  just as long as you get  viral and get noticed by the whole world... welcome to Trumps trend and idiotic effect...be negatively viral....
This is his first time showing something like this. I think we should all just forgive him, then forget about what happened. I just can't believe EVERYONE IS MAKING A HUGE DEAL ABOUT IT THERE IS NO POINT!  WINEING ABOUT WON'T DO ANYTHING. If your with me reply #savelogan
Shut the fuck Up
Please ABC news please react to this video and let me know what you think #logang4life also watch it explains why we are defending Logan Paul it the other side thoughts the video is this(Defending Logan Paul for showing an Hero in his vlog (over reactor)) ( made by Reactor) let me know what you think.
He doesn't deserve to be defended in the slightest bit. He's a complete scum.
Logang4life we all make mistakes so do you
no one makes that huge of a mistake also you know whats a mistake logan paul brainwashed kids parents who forgot to wear condoms whan having sex
Lucky Moon AJ I agree
Logan Paul made such a little mistake. I mean, how could he have expected that he would find a dead body in a place called suicide forest? And he accidently kept recording and accidently posted the Vlog. We all make little mistakes like this. Ugh he's worse than his brother.
But his mistake can be unforgettable
and the las vegas shooter did it beacause he was stressed then. his body over reacted.
I can't believe it. I don't want my favourite youtuber to leave. how many pats I get on the back means a like on this comment
IT'S SUBSCRIBERS
my mom ascd me if i sow that
I wonder how much longer it will be before the Yakuza puts a hit out on Paul?
Some weird gurl: You may not know your kids are watching this guy
Bish is you blind 
How could filming a dead body be positive? Maybe it could raise awareness, but wtf.
I was subscribed to him, but this has gone too far, even though he apologized. Im done.
He didn't do it for views? >.> What?
Unsubscribed from LP
Please people turn to Jesus the signs of evil and love for many has grown so cold. Logan Paul doesnt care at all for the dead person he did it for views and popularity. He only apologized because now he has ended his career. Reading this makes me sick I hope this kid matures and grows up!
Se arruin horrible
1. Suicide is wrong and the dead body shouldve never been there 2. Logan Paul is wrong to do that but that being said you cant judge someone unless you are them.  Tell me if I made any spelling errors
Thinh Phan well you are acting like one he probably was looking for attention( btw I dont support him/ not a fan) but you will never know what he truly is whether that be bad or good. So really you will never understand anyone but yourself if you judge everyone
u think its not that obvious to see what hes like in his videos? fuck off u stupid little kid
Bunch of sensitive fucks lol
#Logan
Logan FOOL
thank youm9(^^)
A- 10 Model fuckyou
His apology seemed insincere. How did he expect to bring "positivity" by posting a video online joking about a suicide? And to add to that, he KNEW he would get views.
unMER the sea if u were in school and ur teacher told u to write a 2 minute apology logan paul just failed
1:51 I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet yes, so show a dead body and make fun of it and encourage other people to do it.
YOU CAN GO TO JAIL FOR THAT
Jeremiah Casias i was just wondering, y he isnt in jail?
He thinks he didn't do it for views this guy is dumb he thinks he made a positive ripple on the internet what the hell ?suicide prevention? 
He got one thing right he sure did raise awareness of what a stupid YouTuber he is
logan paul's an ass clown looking for views, no way to justify him or what he did, no fanboys allowed here please, i hate him, i hate fan boys, simple as that, he deserves to be burried in a shit grave
idiot lvl: american
Unsubscribe from logan
I NEVER SAW THAT VIDEO BUT I KNOW THAT IT WAS BAD THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS VID AND BUO LOGEN

boi shut up brainwashed 11 year old
Bendy474483 colella 29 replies, 3 likes. how much do you need to realize how stupid your life decisions are?
Forgetting to take out the trash is an accident. Logan Paul posting a video containing inappropriate material consisting of him mocking the dead body of a suicide victim is 100% intentional. He knew quite well that what he did was out of line. And guess what? It's not like he was live streaming the entire ordeal and "accidentally" stumbled across a dead body. No. He purposefully decided to film it and post it for his young audience to view so that he could boost his popularity and financial gain.
Trying to help with suicide awareness, nice job dumbass. Maybe if he had titled his video appropriately instead of clickbaiting people would have understood
Subscriber dumbass
Like this if Logan is getting his channel take down
I WATCH THIS FRICKING NEWS EVERYDAY!!! THEIR LETTING MEH DOWN HERE!
Sick very Sick
HUMBLE BRAAG
him and his brother need to gtfo
im not gonna commit suicide cause then logan paul will mock me
Ja wat the problem loan deleted  the  video
Shut up stupid news I love Logan!!!!!!!
Lol, 15 million "followers"
yeah and now EVERY single youtuber's filming response videos and milking this situation thinking they're better than him. i'm beginning to really hate youtubers....
Followers? I think you mean subscribers
People have there rughts
Logan is stupid for doing this
oh crap the logang in some trouble
Utube should be shut down if he was a real journalist he wouldn't work again and his paper would be at least suspended look what happened to the News of the World paper.  Have witnessed dead bodies and it was a car smash so very unexpected I have a instagram account and the last thing I would have done is film it. And being a millionaire is not everything and does not make someone into a worthy person. This man has bullied his way to the top of utube presenters with children as his audience this was a planned trip he was told what he'd find and went off the tracks with the intention of finding and recording a dead person. If he put that much planning into arranging a trip to the Suicide Forest where there's many dead bodies it's done to get the reaction that he has got. His views of all his still monetized vloggs have tripled and he's doubled his fortunes with his old videos he can happily shut his channel and retire now in peace without ever worrying that he's got too old for his pre teen followers. So why on earth would you all be impressed by him instead of ignoring him you all keep giving him more and more publicity making everyone involved in this whole scam as psychopathical as he is .
You guys just want money and views your just as bad as him
Damn. This shit on abc news
Jekhi GamingYT abc news r bunch of fucktards
So he happily walked into a suicide forest, as if he were expecting nothing... once he sees an actual victim, he victimizes himself and LAUGHS ABOUT IT!!! This is not your tragedy. So why tf go into this forest. And even worse, FILM IT.
NotSlick you're the dumb one. Logan raising suicide awareness? Fuck no. He completely disrespected the suicide victim! How does disrespecting a dead person raise suicide awareness? He even laughed at him. Like what? Is that how it's done? If it is then I should film someone about to commit suicide, laugh at them, and now I have a suicide awareness video? Great.
What bothers me the most is that he didn't just choose to film it...but post it, and edit it....it took thought behind that video....
Excuse me, but might I say that he had no business going to that forest in the first place and the fact that he filmed this tragic accident makes it even worse. Keep in mind that he also walked off the trail even though that is not what he should have done. I find it nice that you can stick up for people, but in the real world people do things that are not needed (such as Logan Paul) and you have to face that. Also may I add that part when you said "instead you watch trash YouTubers like Markiplier and Pewdiepie" now I personally don't really like to watch Pewdiepie, but I do believe that Markiplier has done much more than Logan and I think your statement was an opinion.
Braden Doucette are you fucking retarded
Smarty Pants he copes with sadness by using humour
You are cool
HE DID ALL HE COULD TO APOLOGIZE! Yes, he cant go back in time and completely fix that, and he KNOWS THAT! He even said Im not expecting you all to forgive me, Im just simply saying Im sorry. People need to understand that we are all human, and humans make mistakes. He knows that he made a mistake and he learned from it. People need to understand that people can be better. He is only in his 20s so he is not a complete grown adult yet, and he is still learning. Even when your an adult you make mistakes, and you learn from them.
Logan Paul makes hundreds of mistakes and doesnt learn from them. are sure he isnt some kind of defective human being?
He said he didn't do it for views, what bull shit
WHO CARES ITS YOUR FALT THAT LOGAN IS NOT RECORDING
THIS IS FAKE LOGAN PAUL IS A GOOD MAN HE ALREADY APOLOGIZED STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
logan paul is such an idiot
He's not even in the top 50 youtubers
I don't wanna come out as someone who supports Logan I know what he did was wrong but...he helped to prevent my brother Greyson from committing suicide along with the YouTuber DAZ Black! Basically Greyson was grumpy, sad and always hurting himself! But one time I came down to get a drink and he was standing in the kitchen his face pale his eyes blood shot as he kept having sleep paralysis and he had a brand new sharp knife held to he wrist I ran over ripped the knife from his clutches and he fell into his knees crying!. I called to my parents they ran down and we all stayed up with him and supporting him!. We watched Logan and he laughed and was happy and DAZ Games also made him laugh so when ever he's angry or sad and feeling as though he would harm himself he'd watch them!. I know that Logan shouldn't of posted that but once a YouTuber gets hooked into filming anything to get views and a reminder the more views he gets the more money he gets so he could have just been in a mind of this is good content!.
Uh no we didn't watch the VLOG of the dead body we just watched a video that he made! This was like 2 years ago but Uh ok...
Fuck u
I dont like u logan pawl
TBNRCutiepie2610 - perfect example of what logan paul's fandom is like. children. look at their channel LOL.
Hater account no fuck you
Stop being mean she.is just saying her opinion how would you fell with this negative comments
Hater account. Shut the fuck up
Jerry Myers That's strange.Did we ask your opinion on how you can hate on an opinion.There is always something people will hate on..You can't change it..She has all the right to type it..Consider the fact that logan posted a video of a dead body,had comments on the body,and laughed some..Think about that..Even if he apologized it still isn't OK..
well. no company wanna sponsor him now, get involve in this mess is bad for business
Joey tran One of his sponsors are actually suing for 4 million dollars
Totally stupid and disrespectful.
Niggas so sensitive about him showing a fucking dead man on camera stfu its not that serious Im sure he aint do it on purpose and he apologized when he didnt have to leave this nigga alone rs
What? This dude's a joke. Biggest influence? Parents....  step up. Sheesh!
15 subscribers not followers that intersgram
It's YouTube fault for not taking it down
All of this hate for only one vid Jesus it is not like he fucked up something and a mistake is a mistake so I don't get why everybody needs to be like that I do it all the time I don't get it and again JESUS. and people can sit behind a screen and trach another person that has over 15 million followers go watch some blupers if you want to comment trash
"I was trying to raise awareness for suicide prevention" *laughs at a  guy that committed suicide and shows it to the world*
FUCK YOU NEWS - LOGANG FOR LIFE
TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING I DO NOT GET WHY DID HE EVEN DECIDE TO GO TO SUICIDE FOREST IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!h
He is just gross. Even if he didn't film the tragic body it's very disrespectful to film in a place like that, it's gross, discusting, just not okay. If you want to raise suicide awarness (i think that is the right term) talk about it not show a body on camera! He targets his videos tword the 9-18 demographic I'm guessing and he knew that, and to put that on the internet tword kids none the lease is just discusting.
What a loser
hes 22...he looks like 40
JUST WHY THESE ARE SPYS
For everyone who hates him give him another chance ok he said sorry it's fine i love him I forgave him you should all to
Logen Paul ar so nice, DON'T HEIT HIM
See how she mentions his cars price, gold digger. Lol
Wow your hating him to!
The world needs to understand we Japanese are angry not only because of the suicide forest video , but also because of all of his behaviors in Japan. watch his videos in Japan and you'll understand.
The US , please keep them in your country. The Pauls and their crews should never be allowed to travel.
He should be banned permanently from youtube.
You suck all of you
Aghhh stop posting Stuff about logan  h deleated it and he saw Sorry so stop
Pity. The YouTuber Colleen Ballinger got her young fans to raise $60 000 on her birthday to donate to a childhood cancer organization. There are good YouTubers out there who don't get the media circus around them but have to deal with the backlash from one idiot on the platform.
15 million *followers* smh
I would never watch him or jake Paul
Everyone in his video is a sick fuck I would hate to be associated with any of them
Yes because when I commit suicide I want to be filmed by an idiot and put on here
Oh look 7K Mavericks
prepare for 8 vdeos made by nfckz,pyrocynical iduubz keemstar that are over 10 minutes and 13 ads and the unskipable at the start.
This guy has now more haters then fans
Keemstar did it better.
Well Logan told us that the video was gonna be hard for me I think is my fault for watching it
F*** off
Logan apologized for his actions so stop ok
You make people look worse than they do.
So This became a big scandal? Damn.
Shit what about his dumb ass movie 
*BACKSPACE*
Go kill your self he warned us
Foreign clowns
Famous in US, maybe. But not in other countries,  especially  Asian countries. See, this is why kids in the US are getting dumber and dumber.
And this is how YouTube works......People with millions of followers can do whatever they like, because they generate money and (real) content creators get halted, because YouTube needs to investigate their videos on 'debatable' content like LGBT issues....
YouTube is despicable....as are the Logan morons.
They said he has 15 mill followers on YouTube they didnt say 15 mill subscribers
When is this drama goin to stop I still love Logan Paul
Why do people take suicide so seriously they took their own life thats their problem
It's funny how everybody talks about how popular this guy is...i am on YouTube all the time and never heard of him
Fuck you ABC news
Let alone the suicide forest incident. There are other vlogs of him in japan doing annoying acts. Eg : taking down his pants in the middle of the street , throwing pokemon balls on moving vehicle and bicycle and walks into a sushi restaurant and throws the ball at the chef , smashing newly bought game onto the floor , bringing raw fish and octopus tentacles into stores and leaving them on a random taxi when he's done having fun with it and so on.
Please do not let this guy ever go on doing what he does. It is extremely inconsiderate , immature , and rude. Do note that he is 22 right now. Unless he's mentally ill for real , there is no way someone that age should act the way he does.
........come on guys I was waiting for you guys to roast the shit out of is content... *IAN WHERE ARE YOU WHEN WE NEED YOU*
I hope Logan's channel gets deleted. There are many petitions to delete his channel anyway. So much of his fans are saying "everyone makes mistakes, *forgive* Logan" but guess what, how are we supposed to forgive him if huge amounts of people are hating of him and he did something teribble that triggered everyone around the world? Fucking Logan should end his channel.
Um yea why didnt they mention he and the girl laughed about it!! It wasnt just ONE mistake! They probably didnt even watch the video, just reported on it.
"YouTube followers"
focus on your priorities and not your Ego
He said he is sorry
And you can't even understand how fake his statement was.
Leave me alone
marcia#1 letchman if I murdered someone and said sorry is that ok too?
He still filmed suicide. Sorry will not fix that.
You guys can carry on saying what your saying about what I said, but im going to apologise  to every one how watched the video and the victim and his family.
I hate Logan Paul now!!!!
Bye bye Logan XD
Jake Paul should be The one in the news, he apolygide Jake doenst.
Just pure idiot.
TFIL did the same thing.... But there were like 5 dead bodies scattered everywhere.... like?
We just started 2018 WTF??????!!!!!!!!!!!!
*DID THEY MENTION HE LAUGHED AND MADE JOKES ABOUT THE SUICIDE VICTIM*
Logan is the best you tuber ever at least to me
I thought it was funny
I used to absolutely love Logan but as soon i watched this i thought he had took it too far he must of knew what was going to happen and not just 'ghosts' it's called SUICIDE FOREST!!! like if you agree.
and why the hell did he not censor the dead body if he was going to post it. the better option would of been to just not post it. its suppose to be for teenagers and under.
Who here doesn't watch Logan Paul? Cause I don't
go back to YouTube you made me
Greed. Greed changes people.
Still in the logang but still disappointed about the sucide forest thing
abc is asking for subs
Aint YouTube monetising content !? Should YouTube be liable for this ?
logangggggg
I just hope that all foreigners are not like Logan. from Japan
I believe Logan, he is amazing and positive and he was only trying to raise awareness, and for doing that, I will say, #beamaveric and #Logang4life
LG- Gator:Goddess I
You need to get off the internet and learn some moral you and your little logangsters (cringe)  Does your parents know you're on the internet? Go outside and do something constructive kids shouldn't be on the internet.
What the fuck
Isdell Moro He himself has said that he doesnt deserve to be defended. And hes right. His actions and his choice were totally wrong. And not just the suicide video, his complete lack of respect, civility and cultural awareness when he was in Japan was disgusting. Defend him when hes innocent.
LG- Gator:Goddess in 10 or so years you will look back at yourself and cry because of the way you acted as a kid
I watched that vid
Relaxx ya'll i bet its all staged.. he sure knows what he's doin, i mean look at the big picture here, this guy's got the fucking media pretty much by the balls at this stage! Just sit back and watch him turn this thing around and blow up even more than he is now.
He just caused the next wave of adpocalypse.
his apology letter is so stupid too....
His recent content was a mistake? How about his attitude and visiting  Japan? Now THAT'S a mistake.
Logang for life and any buddy that doesnt like him after one video and he made one mistake he is human we all make mistakes . Logang for life
S WARRIOR  he is on YouTube agin so I will each him and not text back to idiots on my on opinion that I tipped oh and your name change it
The way your acting right now it could have fooled me and stop making excuses for the douche what he;s getting is exactly what deserves. I also take it you didn't see his japanvideo then? Let me clue you in on something i've seen another video of an incident that happened in the aokigahara where a gentleman handled the incident correctly  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrJa4FRYveg Now tell me who handled it the correct way instead of continuously filming the poor guy's corpse and cracking jokes and talking about being the first to do it, Tell me which one was more adult about it little miss grown up.
you could shut your big mouth by the way I am 32 and so you guys need to grow up and get off the internet  and if you watched the video you would know what he said about it and how he did not want kids to come across it and for people to never see it and he was laughing because some people when they dont know what to do they laugh and his friend told him a joke 
I is my opinion I dont care what you think  and there is way worse videos out there
I cant wait till you grow up maybe then you'll have some sense and want to slap your present self. Also to add get off the internet and go do something with your little life
I don't mean to offend someone but...... everyone is giving out that he was laughing at the body. That was HIS reaction maybe others would laugh too. Don't accuse people of stuff that you might of done yourself. BTW I don't support Logan and he deserves the backlash
Intended to raise awareness by what? Making jokes about it? Didnt know that is how it works
Why would i subscribe to a tv news channel, lame.
15,000,000 subscribers
damn nigga made it to ABC news
"I intended to raise awareness for suicide and Suicide prevention", and posted video where he was seen laughing and joking at the dead body!!
I love Logan but that was a low move it will be a learning point for him every one makes mastakes
Immature f*ck y*u Paul !!!! Shamed on you
he is just getting more publicity from this
So I guess I'm in the wrong racket.  I guess I should just be making stupid ass videos and sucker millions of idiots to follow my YouTube channel and then make fun of a suicide victim then I could be making lots of money too.
Booooooooooooooooooooo. You guys yaaaaaaaaaalogan
its 15m subscribers you stupid girl
He's a piece of shit.
Am I allowed to say that?
Cuz if not I don't give a fuck
And that poor dead man was used to get another video trending ):
Pinkfluffyllama May he literally walked to a place called suicide forest with a camera crew
Maya Colon He didn't have to upload the video or he could've cropped it out so "SHUT THE FUCK UP DUMBASS!!!!!!!"
1. The face was blurred on the sensored videos. On Logan's video you could see the pain and how lifelike your so called "dummy" was.
2. Well that's fucking obvious. They killed themselves a few feet (Not 300 feet, you fucking idiot) from the parking lot because they didn't want to walk far before they went through such pain but they also didn't want to be helped.
I find it disgusting that you'd stick up for Logan paul and claim "It'S a DuMmY!1". Like, no sweetie, you're a dummy.
"A child" Hun, if you're on Youtube you should be ready for swearing.
1. He went into a suicide forest and not only that, HE WENT OFF TRAIL. What did you think he was going to find? Dandelions and bumblebees?
2. Yes, we all make mistakes but we don't all go out looking for dead bodies for views. 
3. He could have cropped out the footage or, ya know, not uploaded it at all or, even better, he could've stayed in America instead of disturbing Japan!
4. Nah I prefer to be loud LALALALALLALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA
Maya Colon what do you think you are going to find in suicide forest? And if he is that stupid to not know he was going to find a dead body than at least he shouldn't have filmed it for the world to see that man killed himself he shouldn't be using that to make money off of youtube he can say he wasn't doing it for getting veiws but he knows ge gets views so he should've known as a 22 year old man people where going to watch that and he would get money and he wasn't showing a respectful or serious attitude in the forest
The video was a fake.
he has been found dead...
Never fear. They probably upset a whole bunch of Yakuza.
No big youtuber out there will defend this guy, probably not even his own brother will defend him on camera! Youtube will eventually turn against him, there is no way they can defend this guy all the way, what he did was straight up AWFUL! How much more can these brother possibly get away with before there's real consequences!
Have to wati until they show the body of a Youtube executive before they get banned.  Imagine the family of that poor victim, seeing his body abused like that.
One can only hope those two are the next found in the suicide forest.
She said 15 million followers on YouTube!  
" I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention" They why are u making jokes about the dead body?
#fuckthisshit
in the vid they said this is a growing up experience no it's not he's a grown ass man and he can't act like it so what do you expect from this inexperienced man child honestly if you ask me I believe that if he were to laugh at anythingit should be kittens babies and rainbows but that's besides the point what TF is wrong with him I know some people handle death differently but if you're going to do that at least check your self out at the crazy house
how did Logan Paul know that someone will die in that exact location when he already talked about what will happen on his next vlog- days before he took the video? hmmm... he might've paid someone to commit suicide? come to think of it, the forest is too big yet he was able to take the video on the same spot where the suicide happened.
ABC!?
{*after parent watches this news*} 
Mom: Right kid no more yt for ever
As long as you just don't watch that channel you should be fine
Galaxy the fuck u guy are dumb
Luckily Im not from USA!
So the kid killed the mom
What he did in his Japan vlogs were absolutely disgusting.
The way he disrespected Japan in his other videos is disgusting af! I hope u'll get haunted by the dead body u found
i thought the GMA cover story was an ad...
Oh btw he's wanted by Japan
spoiled brats will always behave like spoiled brats. fucking douchebag!
Isn't bullying a reason why suicide happens?Yes it is. 
SO WHY IS EVERYONE BULLYING LOGAN OVER THAT SUICIDE THING.ITS CALLED THE SUICIDE FOREST FOR A REASON!(NOW BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING NEGATIVE NANCYS I CANT WATCH THE BEST YOUTUBER THERE IS!)
get off the internet kid
Bullying? lol, he's 22 and made a video laughing at a person who took their own life and he's getting major backlash for it. He isn't a 4 year old who's getting laughed at by everyone because he farted in class.
All we ask is that the mainstream media resist their natural urge and not equate Logan Paul to the rest of the YouTube community. He does not represent the vast majority of content creators
TBH Logan probably hasn't made a video since then because he's enjoying the insane amount of money he got from it. Even if he didn't monetise it I bet heaps of other people looked at his other content since he uploaded that video
ts s  as a s t st at.  t s a t st   a  tt.
I feel bad. I want 2 c the video. It came up in my recommended but I ignored it. I saw the title and it was eye-catching but, I said I'd watch it later. Now I'm c-ing all this h8 on him. What happened>>>????
Not very happy that my kids were able to see this video before I could stop them 
If I ever had a million subscribers I would never film a dead body that was just sick what he did and he should be banned from YouTube.
Everybody clickbaiting 
Why do they give this puke attention? This crap just makes him more money.
 why did he quit yt fudge u yt 
Why is Logan in so much trouble TFIL did it
I'm not into watching trash.
The amount of hate Logan is getting is expected. Hes been on YouTube long enough for his fans to personally know him. Weve grown with him, been there for him through thick and thin. This is just one of those thick situations which tests Logan and the people who will actually support him through everything. He says not to back him up in his apology video but I still will. People make mistakes. And for anyone and everyone who bashed Logan for his mistake isnt doing anything any better. So by thinking your standing up for suicidal people, youre just bringing more hate and negativity to our world. Logan has done so much more than any of you. Give him a break, he apologized and takes full responsibility for his actions. Learn to grow up and be mature. Its crazy that even though hes going through a rough patch, he still knows how to react and be the bigger person, you guys should take notes
Now I'm understanding the idiot kids out there a small bit, especially if they are watching this moron. He is pure trash. He did not do this for suicide intervention, he did this for ghosts etc and to be the complete idiot he is.
1 800 274 8255 fuck that number just call the police
https://acorns.com/invite/ZZ9ZG7 lets get money together
And now he might be ending his vlogging career like logan wanted to vlog for his whole life and now its ending because of all of the hate thats going in logans head that is basically telling him to quit his vlogging career and to be a casual citizen doing nothing
Just stop hating if you dont like Logan or jake dont even talk about them yeah logan made a mistake and posting that video but everyone makes mistakes in life even tho it went to far everyone still makes mistakes in life so you have to accept the fact that he apologize because he put that poor dead mans body in his video. So it's all over now so stop talking about it your just going to make this oh thing to worse and it could lead other people to lead going to make suicide happen and end there life's
Melon  Tart 
He is not  foreigner.()
He is just a  harmful person()It's pun.
Whats going on here?
colette leblancI guess so
  are you Japanese?
He said sorry
Called subs
Looks at title.   Me: 2018 WILL BE GREAT !
/////WARNING: I DONT CARE ABOUT HATE//////////
Guys Logan said in his apology video that he didn't know what to do and that he's so sorry, he was just trying to raise awareness but he went about it the wrong way. I do agree he should have put down his camera for some sympathy but again he didn't know what to do. He has apologised to everyone like what more do you guys want. Logan's admitted to his mistakes and taken down the video which in my opinion was the right thing to do. You guys have to understand he was just trying to make content for his fans and thought nothing wrong in doing that until he realised what he had done. You guys have to have some sympathy for him, he's trying to make it better in every way he can because I know that Logan is actually really sweet and kind in person. LOGANG FOR LIFE.
Look it's the sympathetic person calling people stupid. Nice going hypocrite. Why don't you dab on though dead body's with jake. Or what ever the new Generation of Duchbags are doing.
Mystic Kitty LOL are you stupid?
Well, here's a news flash for you. Logan doesn't give jack shit about you or any other "Logangster". In fact, he doesn't give a damn about anyone other than himself. The only thing he truly cares about in his sad and rather pathetic life is his personal ego and the amount of revenue he's making off of his shitty videos. As seen in this lovely little situation good ol' Logan got himself into, he will gladly disrespect and mock the dead body of a suicide victim if he believes that it will benefit himself in regards to popularity and money. It honestly shocks and disgusts me that moronic individuals like you actually support this piece of scum.
So good guys laugh at people that killed themself? Then use them as a ploy to make money off there tragic story while mokimg the heartbreak that ended in there lives....?
what about making the dead body his thumbnail image? whats your excuse for that?
American comedy is such lowbrow trash
If Logan (or whatever) committed suicide because of this it's the poor person's curse. He humiliated him/her and now he's humiliated.
Logan paul
? ? (S)he said Logan Paul = SHIT SHIT SHIT 100
Thinh Phan 
a.k.a.  yep!
LOGANG
Why does he look like a stupid alien
Nope. He did it for views.
Gold Boy Kid YOU didnt know that he did it for views.
Martin Duran you didnt know anything.
Alex Can drawl :D oh sorry he forgot the truth hurts. Especially to evil, conniving, sociopaths like you...
Martin Duran Stop Stop IT STOP
Logang4 Life you know what? Maybe he didn't. But he *is* a  either A: Fucking idiot or B: Whoring out for views
subscriber not follower
2 months later everyone fot gives him and then everyone looks at his videos again
i didnt even know who this fucker was till he was a gaint douche bag, the fuck is he famous for
Logan is a nice guys
he fucking sucks
Even the news are onto him lol
LOGAN PAULS RESPONSE TO THAT DEAD BODY IS NOT EMPATHY AND AWARENESS
ITS SOCIOPATHIC AND DANGEROUS TO SOCIETY!!!
Who is this douche bag? Get him the fuck off Youtube
Bad karma for life, you have no respect #standforthesilent
When I think my life is going to shit already I watch this and think I'm so glad I'm not Logan Paul right now ...
i dont want to be mean but i never even liked logan paul... *for reasons*
He is a brilliant youtuber
no he fucking is a child
Americans are so dumb !
Why is Logan Paul being singled out???  When this video  has almost 18.000.000 views "Suicide Forest in Japan"!!!!!   EXPLAIN PLEASE!!!
Sick! Burn him!
gd should have called the cops or something when he seen that man laying on the floor.  most normal people try to help even though the person is deceased...
Things to name Logan Paul 
-jerk
-stupid
-fool
-racist
-dumb
-disrespectful 
I dont care what you Lagan Paul fans think about this video he made if u think hes innocent or not that type of guy but if he was really an innocent person he wouldnt do such a thing as video a walk through the suicide forest and laugh at a person who chose to kill them self. I know someone not personally but   They lost their uncle to suicide which was really sad. Even is a person is dead or alive you shouldnt make fun of them its just not respectful to that person or their close family and friends. I really wish Logan could learn to be respectful to others and not make silly jokes about something serious like this I mean what type of person is he, or wait maybe hes not even human. If i was in his position I would not post that video instead I would turn of my camera and spray instead that this person finds a life in paradise. I really hope he learns his lesson even if he says he didnt mean to do it. Many people look up to social media stars for entertainment, YouTube is a public entertainment industry which include young people reaching to the age of somewhere around 7years. I hope you learn your lesson Logan Paul you stupid bitch.
thats not suicide prevention and even if it was i think he would just laugh his butt of laughing about how people kill them selfs like 100 times a year its not helping people with mental problems like depression and other ones
Logan paul is stupid
Trust me kids always watch him a group of 3rd graders be talking about him
His 'apology' video didn't seem so sincere.
His video 1 day 6 mil views
This channel 5 days 5 mil view
Targeting an audience of teenagers and children???????!!!!!!!Adults watch it too, you stupid news  gma. You people report things that aren't true/ that isn't confirmed. What Logan did was wrong even if he took down the video(which this  video should!!!!!!) and had a sorry video about it. It still doesn't mean it's good its bad, but he's trying to make up for it in every way he knows how. We have all done bad,terrible,mean,awful things in out life and some have been on accident and we most of the time try to make up for it. But, do we just get bashed down, some times. But, Logan is a young foolish adult like most and like all of us has made and will make mistakes in there life time. He is trying to say sorry, but all you a-holes do is just don't give a shit and will never get over it. I bet people habe posted shit like on line, but they don't get as much hate as this.
She said he has 15 million followers its subscribers
He was a star?? I thought he was a joke..    edit: no hate me :(
Emily Frowley you a jerk I hate you
Kimberly Maltos what
Your a joke
TBNRCutiepie2610 - BITCH suck it
f everyone who talks fuck about him. it was just a an accident. he erased it OK GOD 
You guys are taking this the rong way he is a amazing person how made a mistake just like everyone else dose he dead sorry an people are still Ruining his life and giving her a hard time it is not his fault he didnt plan this hes a great person who packs lives of other people who motivates children who helped you get through the day if youre for depressed recyclables you can look up a video ahead and put a smile on your face he does something great in the world the fact that you guys are basically ruining his life over on the steak that anyone could have made is making you guys horrible people
He needs to leave toutube
makayla naves logan doesn't need to leave YouTube but he does need to learn his lesson and logan must tell jake paul to learn a lesson CAUSE BOTH OF THEM ARE DISRESPECTFUL!!!!
i think he should leave youtube too. And you dont ask for an opinion, you give one. jesus such a negetive comment section.
maybe, i think he needs to leave YOUtube
Aliciaxox why the hell are you making a big deal and just worry bout ya self not just you but others
Aliyah Rojas nice one
I am not mad at him cuz i used to it . Always on a holiday we visit a haunted house hospital prison everywhere and i always saw a body im just 11
please tell me she did not just say followers it's subcribers
No offense to Paul fans/jake and Logan fans but that's why I don't like Logan and Jake Jake has some weird and bad attitude while Logan being cool and all those sh*t and kids watch their videos like WTF?...  If I were those people I would've stop watching their videos! Tbh I just think they just want views and subscribers! And wow 24 trending on Philippines?!? I don't even care about Logan's apologize! I know he did it on purpose and Jake is just mean that's what I heard and even my friends told me don't get me wrong cause this is my opinion! You just can't agree with me cause your a fan of them!..
I wish they could stop saying allegedly it's called the suicide forest the man was dead and his body was hanging from a tree. what this yooutuber did is completely inexcusable and the news inability to own up for him just makes me glad that I don't watch the news anymore
He wasn't even funny how the hell did he get popular
God I Wish That Where Me After Watching His Videos
He has 15 million Followers on YouTube 0:38 
It has been reported that worldwide suicides has been dropped by 37% since the video was  uploaded
Govind Singh Solanki delete your comment if your not sure about your source
That was on a satirical website.
this can be wrong bcuz i found these statistic on instagram, logan is idiot he did a big mistake what he did is truly wrong *(-_-)*
Govind Singh Solanki LOL is that for real??
Michelle Obama is a man
could this be how indeed this generation see the world, purely for there amusement.  this is the generation that one day is supposed to run the world in the future.  we need life extension science to make sure these idiots don't take control.  probably still living in our basements after we are long dead and buried.
LOGAN PAUL DEAD BODY VLOG (COMPLETE).. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-5dhppoGs
Thank you!
*One of youtubes most popular star*
FUCK ALL YALL BEING LIKE IM MAD AT LOGAN PAUL ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT FUCK YALL AND THE FUCKING NEWS AND HE DIDNT LAUGH DUMB ASSES YALL DUMB FUCK YALL BITCH
Dear @Aaron Paul,
FUCK YOU! He did nothing wrong. He is a good guy and he did nothing wrong. When he was laughing,and I know finding a dead body is no laughing matter,it wasnt because he found a dead body. He knows suicide is not a joke and he wasnt laughing about that. You can eat elephant crap. As a cunt -Aaron Paul- once said,Go rot in hell.
Best way to start 2018, 
number 4 so far
I can't believe Logan paul is not making videos i LOVE LOGAN PAUL!!!
This is what put him on the news
ima logang and i forgive logan. he always make day. even tough for a little mistake, he stopped vlogging.
poor logan
WHAT THE I DIDNT KNOW
A privileged white kid who fucked up. I haaaatte logan paul
teens watch him too
Logan paul makes japaneese people wish they won world war 2 
I'm gonna get Logan Paul off YouTube. 
We will get there. We will win.
https://www.change.org/p/susan-get-logan-paul-the-hell-off-youtube
Never go to Japan
https://youtu.be/7EM3jeSvdBI
You think Logan is more mature than Jake?
That's where you're wrong kiddo
Clorox Bleach they both need to drink u
Clorox Bleach what do you mean by that I feel like Logan just has like 1% more Brain cells then jake for the fact he cause such a disturbance in his neighborhood (Jake)
At least Jake has some self aware smh. Not a Jake Pauler though.
Clorox Bleach What do you mean? Both are immature. In fact, Jake wouldve done worse because hes hungrier for views and hes slightly more retarded
Clorox Bleach they are both trash
Abc u are all wrong  he forgives of what he did why should you even show this on your news  and when he sees this it makes him feel that all of us are mad at him and it might have been his fallt but stop judging him about this.stop!
Oh No
He messed up BIG
The "I didn't do it for views. I get views" part bothers me the most out of his apology for some reason hahah
this was posted on my bday :)
YOU DID IT FOR VIEWS STOP LYING
Now usually I'd support protest comments against ur so quiet shy u don't talk labeling bullies like Portia Hughes of Tuscaloosa who in lemoore childishly bashed on a former bagger with that as if he wasn't there on a 9/5 rule violating tip, but now that speech is rebuttled and repelled, but this video in partyicular situation seems to have its own dire situation, let's rebuild.1 second ago
Fuck ABC new's they are getting popular with doing this shits to others
*Whoa toacha my badet*
I havent seen logan paul in tv
Yo news people never talk about YouTube because you dont know what its about for1 Logan Paul is try to make a statement about not to kill them selfs because you have people that love you and look up to you but Logan Paul shouldnt have shown the body instead he shouldve said theres a dead body and he not camping in the woods
I cant tell if youre on his side or not. Your grammar is horrible!
Do you know how to English, my dude?
alex ballard Damn Logan Paul brainwashes people more than the government
LOGAN WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS???!!
Dear abc news this is no growing experience. In the first place he should of stopped what he was doing and called for help but he decided to keep filming and showed the dead on his video. 2nd he was self loathing hisself on his apology. 3rd he didnt have the common courtesy to just say Im not going to post this video. Because even if he gets views he wants more. So dont say its a growing experience because its not.
extradite logan paul
This guy may have millions of dollars but he is still trash. He has no respect for the dead and he wouldn't of posted that video if he didn't think he was being funny. He wasn't posting it for suicide awareness he was laughing and joking the whole time and then bragging about how no one else has posted a dead body on YouTube. He has absolutely no respect for anyone at all. I feel bad for his neighbors.
Its normal i see alot of white americans in Tailandia that look to sleep with young kids they don't know how to ack and they love taking racist pic they should just stay in america if they can't be good
Total disrespect by an idiot and because you are rich these days, doesn't mean you are moral and/or smart.
He was better off with vine
#loganpaulsoverparty
Everybody shut up to new year get over it make it the best you you can
Can these guys just get over it..? He didnt mean to take offense and hes very sorry. Get over it people. 
Logan is a trash human being
It was one mistake he done and he said sorry what he done so you guys don't have to be mean to him anymore you just being rude 
Logang for life!!!!!!
Of course pepsi endorsed him
I hate him now I used to love him now HATE HIM MORE THAN SOMEBODY SLURPING
Why hasn't YouTube banned Logan Paul yet? Will someone please start a petition to do so. I would definately sign it.
I didnt know youtube had F O L L O W E R S
I would still kill Jake Paul over Logan Paul. As much as I hate them both.
My 9 year old niece loves him..
Should I tell her to stop seeing him!
Your dumb Loren pale
Leave logan alone
The reason why Logan Paul has so many views because they're all kids.
FAKE NEWS SHUT THE FUCK UP.
What Logan did hurt me because Im 12 and am fairly smart and believe me I know who and who not to watch. I watch the good YouTubers, Casey Neistat, Roman Atwood, not the people who wast their money like Logan and Jake Paul on crap to destroy and post inappropriate content. It hurts me because I lost my 19 year old cousin due to an overdose and it broke my heart and my best friend! My little cousin! 10 years old is his brother and we both still cry because of this. He died a year ago. This is why Logan Pauls selfishness makes me mad. That family probably didnt know that that man killed himself. And if they had to find out because of that, I would been heartbroken. He did it for the views, money and fame. And I cant believe someone like him is aloud to post content on YouTube! It just upsets me because I have lost some people very close to my heart and just thinking of what the family have had to go through . I just pray to God for them and to anyone else who has lost a family member. Amen.
So much cringe and disrespect. This guy has no morals and respect. See what clout does. All that bullcrap excuse dont take it guys. Take him off. Him thinking he could start a disrespect trend to go into countries smh. Fuck this guy and his career. He went over board.
idiot
Well I'm grateful I didn't like him and his channel from the start. I'm still wondering why do kids like that channel
wtf....
ABC news
http://buzz-plus.com/article/2018/01/06/logan-pauls-youtube-illegal/
No Logan give him YouTube
Poor Logan..
Piece of shit
Sorry but did they say followers it's subscribers
So, ok its just a dead body so what can you do about it people its ded its old soooooo
The damn exaggeration grow tf up
lol ITS CALLED SUBSCRIBERS
Logan Paul wow 
Anyone who looks up to him is disabled
Logan got nothing on PewDiePie he the real star
*Why Logan Paul? Why*
I don't get why people are so pissed, he didn't disrespect anyone he just filmed his reaction. He didn't even show a dead body either. Why are people so pissed? I dont support the guy or anything, I always thought he was stupid myself but in all honesty I dont see anything wrong with what he did.
Look at his way of apologizing.
'I didnt do this for views. I get views.' Total spoiled brat he is.
Get out of my sight! And don't show your face here again!
Content Cop get on this shit
To be honest, If this sick jerk was in any white country and found a suicide body; I think he would still have recorded it and ridiculed it because the jerk will do ANYTHING TO GET VIEWS!  I HOPE THE FAMILY OF THAT POOR MAN SUE THE PANTS OFF LOGAN PAUL & YOUTUBE TOO (for not removing it immediately)! 
I shouldnt be standing up for Logan Paul and I know probably most people will tell me stuff for doing this, but Logan Paul a 22 year old young man posted a YouTube video about someones suicide and its truly sad all kinds of people are saying hurtful words to him. Dont you think he feels bad already you shouldnt be making it worse for him hes a great guy and it sucks to see him go though this bc he didnt know what he was doing he thought he was doing good, but then realized he wasnt. A lot of people probably hate Logan Paul now, but at least you could respect him and not say mean things to him just keep it to yourself. Your all probably saying why should we respect him if you he cant respect someone else? You can respect him because if you respect maybe hell learn how to respect. I am and always will be in the Logang Im here for Logan through thick and thin say whatever you want to me i dont care.
I love how in the video she mentions He's only '22' There is no excuse for his inappropriate behavior. Lmao I don't think you could fix stupid.
Lord Narwhal, Oh no I forgot some punctuation. End of the fucking world and lots of people barley  use it unless they're writing something. I mean you can't determine intelligence through grammar. #GrammarNazi
Levi McCollum Besides I didnt get offended by what you said on your deleted reply, I dont give a shit about Logan Paul, besides the fact he actually filmed a corpse.
Levi McCollum Stop acting smart, you cant even use correct grammar. Its Lmao I dont think you can fix stupid, not Lmao I dont think you could fix stupid. Your trying to prove a point be using big words in your P.O.V but those words are just an everyday use to me.
I agree with you
Lord Narwhale despite your unnecessary profanity. Its entirely Logan Paul's choice to grow up someone can't just fix his stupid actions and low IQ for him so yes it is possible to fix stupid to a certain extant. I mean its not acceptable for a 22 year old to be that Dumb lmao. I know you can fix stupid but its the person's choice to make more intelligent decisions.
I watch him and i am stil 9
I don't get it people commit suicide all the time it's never going to stop
shut up
Hes A Jerk I have no Idea Whats wrong with him!!!
Why does everyone need to bullshit him look so he posted a dead body i dont give a fuck maybe it was stupid and disrespectfull but the media is one fucking bitch gosh u just like to look for the bad leave hiom alone he is not making any vlogs atm because of this bullshit and i really couldnt care what the fuck he wanted to do SO just chill the f out
I was so shocked when I saw Logans video. I made a short film recently and based it off that exact forrest. It's called "ELEGY" on my channel. Please check it out.
Stop talking a bout Logan Paul
this is trending . wth
15m followers wtf
Knigge I hate you for posting and send  Logan Paul is bad you're wrong you don't know one thing about him I mean I'm sorry that I'm posting this I just now found out and I'm really mad about so guess what I'm a find out where you live and you probably won't find out where I live but I don't matter
I im mad
No one was convinced to stop committing suicide by watching hid video!
Sorry Chester....
This guy represents sadly the arrogant , disrepectful, obnoxious, ethnocentrist mentality of americans! No wonder americans are so much dislike abroad
YouTube has to ban his account ASAP!
That's a Libtard for ya.
He was never always a 'DOUCHE' as you say as he had no idea that there was going to be a dead body as there is an apology video for Logangers and it was all a mistake for him to film it as it will take a while for Logangers and fans to forgive him. Also it wrong for them to show a dead body yes but it doesn't mean you start hating on him for that. And if you never understood why he posted that apology video then you're fucking dumb? I end my case (also please no hate replies as they will be taken down)
He is not sorry...
LOGAN APOLOGIZED PEOPLE HE APOLOGIZED GAH STOP HATING
Stop fucking saying that the suicide ppl are victims they choose to do it
Loge my bro can i meet you
Omg its everywhere
Bujezis
#shutdownLoganPaul'sChannel
15 million followers lmao arent they subscribers
Its true when you are the top, one dumb action can ruin your career which can be seen as Logan Paul's incident because due to his actions, his  career as an entertainer is in jeopardy...
It is his fault he made just one a little mistake
Thinh Phan u
Samplemsx Legit nah he knew it was wrong but he still filmed it and edited it. logan paul had more time than he needed think if it was wrong to post it on yt. guess hes that fucked up. total disregard for the mans life
Isabella Watt FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
Nataly Olivas omg how retarded are his little kid fans???
Isabella Watt you where a little fucking mistake
oh , so HE'S The victim now ?? smh
Goodbye bitch
Hehe Logan u idiot
Logan paul said sorry already yall need to just let it go if you guys were in his shoes you guys wouldnt be able to handle it so just stop bulling him
He didn't allegedly post a video of a dead body. He 100% posted a video of a dead body.
Sorry ABC but nobody watches him except for dumb people and little children. Hes too white and stupid for me to like him.
they called him paul  xD 1:08
He is weird, and the reaction he gave is who he really is...
"raise attention on suicide"
then why are you laughing!!!!?!?!!
We apoligized
Who CARES if Logan is rich or famous. Dont just record a dead body and put it on Youtube. It should be common sense to not take pictures of your dead grandma or take ridiculous Selfies at the Holocaust site. Im just saying that Logan has his friends there with him and No ONE told him to edit that dead body out. NO ONE. How many dead brains are there????? I swear their Ego is just too high and just because they have Youtube carrying their balls.
Boo Logan Paul amazing
Please stop just stop! Do you know how much this hurts the LOGANG I HATE YOU!!!!!
Let's see how much my sister idolizes Logan Paul after i show her this...
Yall need to shut up
I hope you got all the sex you want
Ok its subscribes not followers
I thought this was fake
He's on the news? This is crazy.
welp one down another one to go lol
Logan Paul is not awesome
they get mad when you telling  the truth he called me a terrorist  you sound like fox news thought this was ABC tf.
$300000 car try agin
This fucking guy made a ton of money out of this shit too
allegedly
He just ended his career......... what a. Way to start off 2018
What a dick 
And now he's more popular
Think of it made me it's your fault
He said you guys are stupid and it won't be coming back maybe they'll retarded and stupid and nuts and stuff and yes he did say don't fight for him to do for him he does it so you guys adult people posted it so shut up about it
Its sad that these days people do anything to get likes and comments form doing stupid stuff like this. At the start of the video like OK you found a dead body. You need to call the police and leave.But he thought it was alright to go and walk up to the dead body and make fun of that his hands were purple and asking "is this a prank" ? At the end of the day you can tell who is the bad person even if you ask people to forgive you or not!
he should get taken off youtube!
Finalllyyyy
what the fuck raise positivity around a suicide
Logan Paul is a piece of shit.  He needs to be knocked out.  I don't get why all the dumbass kids these days follow this loser
people are too easily offended in todays world. Its not like Him not posting the video would have brought the suicide person back to life, they are still dead. If u dont want people to make fun of you then dont kill urself, easy enough.
He has 15 million "followers" on YouTube... wow
0:37 he has 15 million followers on youtube 
I use to like him
Bullshit you are not sorry he is a lyre
They said he made a mistake well its a bit more then a mistake...douche
Logan Paul is a moron And YouTube Executives are just as moronic. Anyone else posting this awful video would have hadthe video deleted by YouTube and even had their channel suspended. Not Idiot logan paul the YouTube cash cow. His disrespectful video wasn't removed until HE took it down. Way to go YouTube for showing ushow biased you really are.
This channel did post logan paul lake this just for the views I love #LoganPaul Am a Logang and am 27 Years old he have good content   and what he did it's just a little mistake so go r.i.p and U will see me soon 
bahaa ouattas I'm not sure what you are trying to say, but ok. And he didn't get his fame from me, I'm not a fan of him. And for good reason
Jerr S Yes, that's why Am saying that causes after all he is a human being it could happen to me or to u not the same why but at least we all should give him a chance cause we all know that he is a big youtuber got his fame from us cause he do nice vlogs at first I didn't see him lake a nice guy when I saw he's video's online I passed but at the end am a fan of him he really do make good content it's actually a mistake so R.I.P for that man and hope he is part of heaven! !
bahaa ouattas a little mistake? No, it wasn't. He knew what he was doing. And you're 27? You should be smarter than the 8-13 year olds who are defending him and saying the same thing. You should know better
hes so stupid for going there in the first place
I don't see the big deal at the end of the day.
video is still posted up.
im Logan Paul fan now what you apologizing for. for year's amerikkka took photos and rejoiced in hanging bodies from tree. salute to keep and real and showed the world how whites really act when seeing a hung body from a tree. dont act different now and negua still getting lynched and it's 2018.
O my goi
What the hell!?!?! "Positive ripple" he gonna get bomed
I cringe when they say 15 million followers
1:53 no i doubt it 
Dafa.......k?
Excuse me i just saw the video i thought it was clickbait
Tradition let's roll
Logahn... Logaaaahhhn... You are Yoshimitsu... Logaaaahhhn... No Blood No Brag... Yoshimitsu is Mad... Back to Movie.... Keep up.
Logan: chill its for awareness lol
Also logan: WOAH LOOK AT HIS HANDS ITS SO BLUE WOOOAAHHH
i understand that he was caught up in the moment or whatever, but he should have known better. he has 15 million subscribers and most of them are kids.
Oh yea he didnt do it for views. Yea totally he just wanted to be positive. Fucking YouTube 2018 hang me with a barb wire
Who ever says that he is the one who did bad yes he did but we all make mistakes that is so rude of you guys leave him alone there is not one person on this earth who has not made a mistake
He doesnt act his age
Hey guys there is a squirrel here its to cute Im not gonna show you
Here is a dead body let me show it to you
Jack Dauth was worst
He made a mistake okay and y'all will get over it. Y'all are horrible because y'all are making him seem so bad
Logan Paul can suck the BIGGEST dick in the world for being a greedy asshole.
Bruh he generally suks a lot a lot
sorry
The media and other YouTubers are editing his video and cutting out his actual reaction to make him look bad for their own views. It's bullshit! Why aren't the showing his message to everyone that suicide is never the answer, how he tries using humor when he is upset, and how upset and shook they were.
I want to meet the parents of these brothers, cause they clearly did something wrong.
Suicide is awesome, can't wait to try it myself!!!!!
Me too god I love Logan paul so Shut up 
1 5   m i l l i o n   f o l l o we r s   o n   y o u t u b e
Bullshit Logan. I dont believe you one bit
Logan and jake Paul think they can  do something very bad and just write a letter to apologize and hope for everyone to forget about what they did .....so many warnings and they still fuck up.
congrats logan your even more famouse
My brother loves Logan Paul
click bait
I'm not necessarily a fan or not a fan of Logan Paul, kinda neutral, but what's interesting to me ABC news is that I just watched said video and Logan's actual quote about "I'm pretty sure we just made youtube history because I'm pretty sure this has never happened to anybody ever" He actually also used the word HOPEFULLY. Though a slight difference ostensibly, your omission of Paul's word HOPEFULLY seems pretty intentional, and when ABC news quoted him in this segment it really seems to me like that choice had to be made to make this dude come off like a a certain type of person. I would imagine that to anyone who watched the actual video or had their finger on the pulse, to anybody with a sense of nuance, these things would be pretty apparent. You're supposed to be journalists, and if you actually are you won't delete this comment.
BOOO U SUCK ABC GO F YOURSELF
**Insert Palpatine's theme**
Good...good...take him down and shut down his channel. Its time for the Paul to end. **Palpatine cackle**
He drives 250,000$ vehicle... Makes dumb videos for youtube etc... Why are stupid people becoming rich like whys it that we all work our asses off but yet these people get tons of free money for doing nothing really  important.
Why do people like either of the Pauls
Bottom of apology says #logang4life this dude needs to grow up
Ik suicide is no joke but i think this just being blown out of proportion people are acting like he just shot up 500+ people
Biggest Mistake? He knew what he was doing. Come on people get some common sense he knew exactly what he was doing.
He ended up raising awareness for insensitive assholes.
Hes not sorry, he wouldnt have posted the video if he was. But he only apologized after everyone plus celebrities got on him about it. And he for sure did it for views! Thats how these YouTube ppl make their money, by the views! Stop bsing that it wasnt for views when that was what it was about! I hope his 15 mon of fame dies after this!
George your kids would be haters.
fu people mind your buisness
fuck logan paul! no respect to the japanese.......22 years old and still a dum like little boy...
Longan what are you doing bro
I saw the video before it got taken down..
Never seen so many people commenting before watching a video. *THEY LITERALLY SAID THAT HE APOLOGIZED AND THAT HE DID THIS JUST TO RAISE SUICIDE AWARENESS.* I liked my comment so that more people would read this. I hope this gets pinned.
Etcetera the Collector And learn how to spell before calling anyone a regard just a little advice
Etcetera the Collector We know he's your role model and you look up to him guess what he doesn't even know you exist fucking weirdo.
What Logan did was wrong, Im not hating on him but Im not supporting him either.
Etcetera the Collector Do you think you're morally superior or something because you forgive and forget. People like you who keep letting these morons get away with everything are the reason they don't consider the consequences. If you really care about someone, you don't let them get away with everything.
Etcetera the Collector 
How the hell is laughing at a dead body raising awareness
They better n fire logon Paul on YouTube
Blue Sky u better be fired
Grayson Bell they better fire him! He deserves it! He only apologized to try and save himself (which thankfully didn't work), and he's not stupid. He's 20-23 yrs old, he knows EXACTLY what he is doing. Wtf did he expect to find in there?!
F*@$ I still like logan paul
Logan Paul is a child molester
Allegedly?
I appreciate him doing this because now im aware theres a damn forest in Japan that practically advertises a safe place for ppl who suffer from suicidal thoughts to commit suicide
Needs his face smashed in....bastard!
ALL I SEE WHEN I GOT TO THIS IS KARMA DRAMA AND NOW THIS IS HORRIFYING
what a moron.... why would anyone follow this disrespectful imbecile..*hello @ parents* ...!!!!!!!
I hate peolle who call subscribers followers
U never liked Logan Paul
I mean I
Pathetic
pfft, pewdiepie is more popular -.-
I stopped watching Logan before all of this happened because of the stupid videos he made. And while I was looking through my recommended videos, I saw the video title and thumbnail and decided not to watch it. 
It is so horrible how Logan filmed that. He truly deserves to get his channel deleted. I don't care if people don't think he deserves, because he does!! He is truly an idiot for doing this. He is more an idiot than his brother. 
Well, they are both idiots.
But why the heck did the guy commit suicide
Sad live No one really knows
Elton castee from tfil when there and was a body there but that didnt blow up shows what tje difference in fame makes
The Pauls are messed up
Die Got to hell
Ugh Logan u disgust me
Idc if Logan does bad things I love him 
Ur weird
He said he was sorry and should never be forgiven.   And Logan never says sorry nor feels bad
There are 50,000 US Military in Japan serving our country. Thanks to this moron they are the ones who are going to suffer because of this nonsense! Hopefully he is never allowed to return to Japan again!
And this is why i dont care about youtube,drama, crazy trends, etc.
It wasn't the best thing to do,
At least it wasn't for the views
the only awareness is dont be a sick bitch
Did anyone else see Jake Pauls losing my virginity video???  Im so surprised Jake needs attention so he stole it from Logan, Jake wont ever be more popular unless a miracle happens and he needs to accept that.  Im  a LogangPauler but jakes rlly annoying sometimes and Logan is a chotch but, this time Jake is really being a d*ck, so is Logan for posting a dead body.
Im still in the Logang tho
XLegendPlayz YT if your in the "logang" you are just as bad as that piece of shit garbage named Logan Paul.
FUCK OFF IDIOTS LOGAN PAUL IDIOT CANCER
This is the most viewed news video ever
"Followers"? Its subscribers get it right ya freaking normies
Only in #america where they get all sensitive with this. In Asia ppl could careless.
UGGGHG LOGANNN FUUCCK U M8
I WAS DEPPRESED FOR 5 FUCKIN YEARS
AlviX Gaming

LOGANG RULES SO WHAT YHEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DEAD BODY'S ANYWAY WHY CAN'T HE FILM I MEAN PUT THEM IN COFINS WHY IS THAT A THING HE IS A VLOGER DEAL WITH IT
he is sorry dumbos
Look I think Logan Paul's amazing I'm I think that he is completely innocent he was just trying to make contact for the internet and I will stand by Logan Paul side even though I don't know who he is well I watch his blogs every day but I've never personally met him I will always stand by your side because I'm a Maverick I will always be there for Logan Paul I think that he was just trying to make content for the internet and whoever else will stand up with me right beside Logan I hope that you see this comment because I will always stand beside him
He showed a fucking dead body
His name isn't paul it's logan and I support him through everything because I'm a maverick when you go left I go right
I'm still a Logang 
slimeandmore maiden His grammar is on point xD
That's saying "I'm subbed to a kid hating, disrespectful, clickbaiter."
how are you a logang im so confused
Thats cuz your a disgusting humanbeing
Willy Villafania same
People need to stop!he already said sorry!Logan doesn't want views from stuff that's wrong the only reason why people are putting stuff like"oh I'm unsubscribing"is because they want views and likes.
Why the hell does this insulting person have more subscribers then Rhett and Link?
#fuckloganpaul
Carlson Umali.CG thanks bro 
of course but in my honest opinion I assumed anyone who defends this guy is a child
My apologies for assuming you were a kid I do however feel strongly about kids cussing and acting like they're grown.
You sure fooled me the way responded didn't sound like you were 21 or even mature for that matter.
Be lucky I don't know you or your ignorant disrespectful self would have ate soap as soon as you opened that dirty little mouth of yours. You need help and btw how about you let your mom know what foul-mouthed little boy you are its some years too early to be stepping up to me little man
you kiss your mama with that mouth? Why are you on the internet go do something constructive
it sad
https://youtu.be/mzDj7LBcFiE click this to see the full video of logan paul laughing at the dead person
like he lynched himself. but the 17 year old black boy get lyhned no media outcry. Japan non black country they don't care and don't expected white amerikkka to understand anything.
stop giving him attention, this is exactly what he wants
i find this Funny AF shout out Logan paul i grew up in amerikkka my people still getting lynched and it's 2018 so if a none blacked is lynched and he did it without #unapologetically black
Why is Logan here jake is worse at least he took it down jake would have said fuck you im not saying Logan was right for doing this and could have did it for views but mabye we should just forgive and forget he apologized and hopefully wont do it again also pls if you comment pls or polite Im a recovering 11 year old kid from suicide
THAT IS LOGAN PAUL!!!!!
Death is Everywhere ! Seeing a dead body really WHAT ABOUT ..THESE OTHER DOCS ON embalming dead bodies and cremation and the Body Farm on YouTube really those Show dead bodies so why are they making a big deal over him showing a dead body now people that commit suicide yes is very sad Seeing a dead body is not taboo why are they making it a big deal The fukn news shows wars and occasionally will show a dead body...
I aint mad at him or hate him...
Come on he didn't show the face he blurred it its not REALLY bad
how can he laugh at a dead body he made me  so sick of him
He knew da wae when nobody listened
I didnt do it for the views.
Yeah right.
Did I just like a video from ABC News?
shit boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooi
Its not called followers, its called SUBSCRIBERS!!! Man these guys has been on instagram more than youtube.
He needs to be killed.
I got to see the Video of the Dead Body, Am very disgusted and devastated knowing that he laughed at the dead body
What the fuck y would a star do something like that
You didnt mention how he made jokes or laughed
You made me mad
LEAVE LOGAN ALONE YOU DONT NEED TO BE IN HIS business
15 million followers on youtube
15 million followers 
*fIfTeEn MiLlIoN followers.*
I never heard a this cunt only from another lad I watch linked it up.. 15mil kids you don't know any better.. shame that Forbes actually rates this clown.. laughing at dead body so desensitised from all those FPS they play
Logan paul you know when u were doing that you shouldn't of posted that but, I still  u
Ok I get that this is bad why did you go and do this about it your just making Logan feel worsen about he posted a video SAYING THAT HE WAS SORRY Plz dont take this as if im trying to be mean
There goes his career
"YouTube star" uhmm sorry who is he? I mean please a dumbass do not deserve to be called a youtube star or any kind of star. In my eyes (and many other people's eyes) he's no one.
He has to make videos of him acting like a fucking moron to the ppl of Japan as well.
His actions in Japan make my Japanese blood boil.  This is not just ignorance in culture though.  This kind of stuff is unacceptable almost anywhere.
I don't care how expensive this guy's car is.  Money can't make him less of a pathetic wank stain.
This guy is the largest moron, I have seen, Keep letting your kids watch this kind of shet Idiocracy will become a reality. A few generations of this IQ level breeding and we will need self driving cars because  humans will be too stupid to drive.
He didn't mean too so stop talking trash about him I love Logan he is my inspiration he is not a idiot he is not dumb it was a mistake and I feel terable for him
Logan is sorry guys
They said followers its subscribers
Like teens aren't depressed enough for no reason
You all made him famous so stop complaining now
Fuck you and the police
Logan Paul is not trash everyone needs to stop hating
Yes you guys are right in some ways he is trash for posting a video but think about all his other videos and all of his fans I honestly think the best thing we need to do is just forget about this it's all over the Internet and there's more important things we can be worried about than this stupid video it was wrong and was very disgusting to post that as you can probably see it's not there anymore
When he says hes trying to raise awareness, but he makes jokes about it
He sucks. I dont understand why the hell he is so popular.
Logan Paul sucks
Everybody make MISTAKES But This is not... Good :/
15 million before -15 million now
I feel like Logan knew what he was doing wrong. His editor posted on Twitter or Facebook (I think) that he and Logan talked about if they should post that video or not but they still decided to post it.
Logan knows that $@#*% like that makes money and views, something he wants. He posted just for the fame.
And before you ugly disgusting Mavericks say But other people go there and they dont apologize for it! , Thats because they know NOT to show bad things on YouTube.
Normally I would say Jake is a bit more stupid than Logan.
But now there both equally as RETARDED than before. 
I feel like Logan didnt make that video to spread awareness for suicide, but instead he posted it JUST for money.
If you do defend Logan you obviously are missing more than half of your brain. You might as well let him commit manslaughter and youll still defend him.
15 million subscribers (not followers _--) but still not cool logan paul --_
I'm team Jake Paul !!!!
Logan Paul did nothing wrong.  Look at the news when they were showing the dead Syrian child. No one complained then.  
Grow up and move on everyone.
Wow this got on the news
News leave him alone he he's really macks my day pls give him one more cage
1:32 his right
honestly the pauls are just douchebag playboys anyway :/
I'm a logangster and i'm a kid and my parents know i watch him
Fucking stupid kids
Emily CuetoRuiz  then you and your parents are trash
Its obvious your like 8. You have to be 13 to make a Google account. 
Clearly you don't have good parents
You have shit parents then.
BRUH LIES!
This happened to PewDiePie. One of my favorite Youtubers. Not where Logan Paul was. But he climbed up a building, And there he found a dead body blood everywhere in a body bag...
logan paul making no more videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_sO6zNdQe8
Lmao its news now
Ben Shapiro has spoken on the issue. He said we need to just get over it.
John Case
Society forms hate mobs over every small thing, but not every thing is "small". And this time, the hate over Logan Paul's act, is rightfully so.
But hey, go on with your simplistic way of thinking. Just don't question why many new gens grow up to be stupid, insensitive, loud and rude, just like their role models. Sure, let those kind of people keep making content. Let the children learn from "the best".
When a lot of people were angry and got together to bring down DaddyoFive's channel, it was called for. Not another little thing that pissed the internet.
He is enjoying this thing
He should face some consequences
exactly
Blue Sky Also other uses have posted videos more horrible than what Logan Paul posted over the course of YouTubes history. People got pissed off but quickly forgot about it but nowadays it seems like people don't get over stuff until the person that pissed us off personal life and career is completely destroyed.
Blue Sky I think his take on this is the most reasonable. Everyone else wants to form a lynch mob and go after Logan Paul and destroy him. Ben said yes Logan Paul is a complete asshole for doing this and for doing everything else he has done and is a horrible role model for kids but we as a society need to stop forming hate mobs over every little thing that pisses us off with the goal of destroying someone's life and career. If that was the case Pewdiepie would have been banned from YouTube and ended up homeless years ago.
Ok he must up but you don't have to hate on him
Such a stupid guy.
Fucking idiot
I saw the dead body the hands were purple
OH MY GOSH PEOPLE! He was laughing and smiling 'cause he was cheering himself up. PROOF: He said; Suicide is no joke.
Yep, he's a douche, he said "I shouldn't have posted this vlog" though he did it cos he's a "daily" vlogger. WHAT A FUCKING WEIRDO
Fuck this guy
Umm no hes not logan paul is not pure trash ok? So shut up
You are awesome
I hope you will get my message
I would think jake stupid paul would get banned instead of this paul
Okay, now this is why I'm a jake pauler.  Logans subs will drop, and jakes will probably go up, even though you probably don't like him, but still jake is fun and happy. Logan is sick and disgusting. Fuck you Logan.  Fuck. You
Even then, this was not a POSITIVITY on suicide. He was laughing along with the ppl with him. He should face a very high penalty for his actions. How dare hes allowed to get away with this. This isnt Suicide Prevention, this was a video making FUN of someone who committed suicide. Hes NOT a Dr. or Therapist!!! Is he mentally challenged or just plain stupid? Good thing my grown kids or grandkids cant stand him. I myself dont find the humor or anything about him funny. He should be completely taken down from all SOCIAL MEDIA. But obviously there are ppl who like making money off him. YouTube has taken ppl off their site for lesser things done. This kid still on, goes to show that money is at the top of the list and NOT on ppl feel or the family of the person who committee suicide. Just shameful and sad. My heart goes to the family and people who were and are offended by this video. As for Logans so called Apology. He knew Exactly what he was doing, you find a dead body. The right thing to do is CALL THE AUTHORITITES. NOT POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA!!!!!! Even my 2 yr old grandkids knows right from wrong. Get real....get rid of him off social media....punishment for a 22 yr old in reality acting like 5 yrs old.  SMH
He's a  dam dim whit
but i stell love him
HOW THE FUCK is making jokes about a suicide victim supposed to make positive ripples on the internet. I am a suicide survivor. This is absolutely DISGUSTING to me.
Every one makes him seem so bad

Loser
Pewdepie has more subscribers than this last ser

Logan is a jerk
I wonder how someone can be so ignorant as this Logan Paul. I admit I never heard of him before but I will not check out his videos now it's 100 per cent sure.
Say i if you want to take down logan paul
Fuck u abc u guys suck as news people suck at what u do
You guys better not kick him from YouTube if he hadn't had found that body it would be horrible what if a kid came across it and caused mentor illness to the child please don't kick him and you guys have put so much pressure on him he feels bad and he not posting please don't kick him. 
Submit this comment to the news if you have to.
2 mistakes really. Distracting Jake (his brother) and this.
 thats why he hasnt posted in 4 days after the video, 
Im Sorry  please forgive him
Dymonds Diary no
Fuck u he did nothin bad!!
I hope that YouTube does something and removes his channel but of course YouTube wont do anything
15 million followers on YouTube
They forgot pewdiepie
I hope he commits suicide in that forest.
He is leaving Youtube
At least he aPAULagized
This bitch said 250,000 dollar vehicle lol who talks like  that
He's on the news wow Logan your every  still respect you  tho
What the hell ????
Subscribers dumbasses
Shutup
 praying deeply for everyone- I truly am shocked and dont know what to say
"Allegedly showing the body of a person who recently committed suicide"
No you ABC News fuckwits, it *was* shown.
Donor of Ruffled Feathers well if I'm so ignorant could you please clarify, and btw you assuming that I'm a weeb just because I love berserk it just proves your ignorance. There are many cultures and I couldn't be possibly familiar with all of them.
David S That's not the point, and never really was. And as someone with a Berserk avatar, one might assume that you _actually care_ about Japanese culture, media, entertainment, and what have you. But alas, you can always count on weeboos to be some of the most ignorant people on the planet. Arguably even moreso than people like the Paul brothers.
Donor of Ruffled Feathers shit just seen the reupload they were laughing at it as group now that's fucked up . Sorry didn't know the entire truth of the matter.
Brylle Cruz I guess an average American never seen a dead body.
Christopher White If you believe this was just one mistake you are both sadly mistaken, and highly ignorant of who the Paul brothers are and how they treat foreign countries, especially Asian ones. This is well beyond the point of deserving any "slack".
In a video
It has happened before
Jake is a piece of shit
15 million subs you mean
Dude that's not even the title it was "I found a dead body"
And what's even more astonishing is that Logan Paul's subscriber count is still going up... Yowza. Looks like he'll still be in business on YouTube because no one will ever take action. The only actions being taken is people making videos about how disrespectful he was. How is that supposed to help? It only gives Logan more views and views to the people making opinions about it.
Can't believe my brother is still obsessed with him
Damn...on abc
How 2018 started
You good bro 
Logan Paul Is a fucking Idiot...
YOU FLIPPIN SUCK! GO F***K UR SELFS
How do you create a video on a dead body and say it was supposed to be positive.
Someone started a petition... https://click.mail.change.org/?qs=ce12c02b658332429fb41033e76f4ef63ca922dc19c73ec6fc1cfc609ec3e1771ff4b19c9843b1525235f9a7ca39bf69f3e4ed48ca935b86e1323f37b7e32415
Give me your fucking money
Fuck y'all haters
 guess it's not funny when you not black.
I mean a lot of people are going insane on this but they have to understand Logan just a 22 year old people made mistake Logan made a HUGE one but still he realised he did wrong and he did a mistake, I know it's a mistake but imagine you on the internet as a 22 year old with this situation you would feel dead and miserable I know this is gonna get a lot of dislikes and hate comments but come on he's only 22
Ketchup Central Man I have a 8 years old cousin that once shouted at a kid, because he was making jokes related to obessity. If a 8 years old can do that, can't a 22 just show respect for a man who has probably gone through so many bad things in life, that thought taking his own life was the only way out? I am not asking him to make a funeral, but you can't just show it on a video and start to laugh of it, because no psychopath or sociopath would do that, I promise you.
Mistake? give me a fucking break he had many shots to not post this all he do is post offensive bullshit and its all for money and views.
22 year-old is not a kid any more. He should be able to predict the consequences of his actions and avoid doing such things. It was obvious that something bad would happen after uploading that video. And the "suicide incident" is not the first stupid thing he did in Japan. I do not pity him, he is completely irresponsible and could finally learn that some things are just inappropriate.
'7 year old child brainwashed by 20 year old idiots defends them on an abc news channel considering the og video was taken down' We are in 2018 now, if anyone is subscribed to logan paul un-ironically, they get the back seat when he drives to hell.
Ketchup Central THAT IS NO EXCUSE!! HE FOUND A DEAD BODY AND LAUGHED ABOUT IT! HE MADE AMERICA LOOK RETARDED, HE MADE THAT POOR MANS FAMILY NAME SMASHED IN THE MUD!! THANKS TO HIM, ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA LOOK STUPID, RUDE, AND COMPLETELY DISRESPECTFUL. WHO GIVES (profanity warning) TWO FUCKS IF HES 22, HE SHOULD NOT BE DISRESPECTING JAPAN BY SHOWING A DEAD BODY AND RUNNING AROUND IN A POKMON SUIT. I UNDERSTAND THATS COSPLAY, BUT ITS STILL DISRESPECT. SO I SUGGEST YOU DELETE THIS COMMENT, OR GET SOME BRAINS.
i guess he committed career suicide
i was already done with logan for faking a service dog but this crosses the line. pathetic foreigner.
Logan is a good guy he saved a babys life and gave the family 2000$ dollars he is a life saver
He is a terrible person from day 1
Mount. Fuji 
Everyone stop the hate Logan is trying to be honest to his fam and he said sorry so stop the hate - Logan lover Katie
Ok but Jake Paul was never on the news
Fuck you
Logan Paul please go to Korea....at least they know how to deal with TRASH!
People need to STOP watching Logan Paul and STOP BUYING ANYTHING/ product that endorses this MORON!
She says "alegedly" but he did show the dead body which is against youtube guidelines.   Get your facts right ABC!
What an idiot
they obviously haven't seen the video
The other videos he made in Japan also showed how disrespectful he was towards the Japanese people. It's a shame so many kids follow him. An idiot like him should not be making so much money.
logan pula is the beast
A experience ???? .. that what she said at the end ??? .. what a joke
Fucking dipshit
Hes not bad
Stupid Fuck. I saw a part where he said "Oh you see those kids right there, what if they stumbled across that body?" Like no Logan your audience is made up of Un-matured kids and teens who don't need to see that. Didn't need to be on YouTube anyway.
you're an idiot... he's sorry for that
Shut up leave him alone
 NONO
 NONO
Fuck all of you that said mean things to Logan Paul
Apparent suicide? Oh fuck all the way off and show some respect.
Just let him be a you tuber give him one more chance
I HOPE AARON PAUL AND SPOHIA TUMMER GO BAD IN LIFE FOR SAYING THAT TO LOGAN
IM GONNA CRY
You are trash
I saw the vid and I'm 12
WOAH dude, whats your opinion about this issue then?
guess it's time for Logan to take the oath ABC news involved. mad at Logan but won't check trump. 
guess it's time for Logan to take the oath ABC news involved. mad at Logan but won't check trump. 
guess it's time for Logan to take the oath ABC news involved. mad at Logan but won't check trump. 
Was also on a news show called Today
Just to let everyone know, it takes a lot of effort for me to hate on someone. For example, Ricegum promises his fanbase something, and he doesn't do it. If you need more reasons, go here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bukzXzsG77o&t=385s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VazkMsdcvoo. Logan paul has made small mistakes, but he has taken time to reflect on what mistakes he has made. Ricegum, he just lets it go and doesn't care at all, or in other words, selfish.
He's actually a funny guy. He doesn't deserve all this hate
scumbag spoiled little rich kid
poor logan deleted the video 
he apoligised
"followers" on YouTube
you suck bitches logan paul rules
Boi. He sucks.
Completely disrespected the Japanese people and everyone else who has lost the struggle with mental illness.
THIS IS SHIT
Thats a 15M stupid followers he have
Hs lost 3M Followers already
The age group of his fans are 8-15. I've seen the deleted video and at the beginning he says i hope you got all of the sex you could??
And not only him but the entire group was laughing with the exception of the guy in the light blue jacket. He barely blurred out the face and why would you show that to children?!? He mocked the spirit's in the forest and laughing at them made me sick!! He wasn't even supposed to enter the forest in the first place!! And he was drinking in the video also!! Is this really who you're letting your children watch on YouTube??
booo logen paul.
Shut up
there was so many lies in this vd
disrespect for other people shouldn't be rewarded by endorsements.  Logan Paul should be executed by scaphism. and it should be posted on YouTube for everyone to watch and LOL.
I didn't see him laughing about the dead man
ABC is Fake news?
The fucking kids who are watching logan paul are lil 12 year old ass licking girls
0:34 50 millions of followers on youtube? Damn *Felix* ... go run for it now D:
This is terrible. You should be ashamed of yourself. His subscribers should unsubscribe to his channel
Huh. Neat. Suicide?! Logan.. I knew you were stupid, but I didn't think you would take it far. Laughing at a dead person who took their own life to RAISE suicide prevention?! Sure, you apologized but still. That's gonna be in your reputation forever.
This is just a sign for 2018
Should have seen his disgusting behavior at a Japanese temple........Disgusting.
It's subscribers
it's an american. what did people expect?
great way to start 2018
omfg don't even start it
Henry M ya but I fill bad for logan
*_ssssssiiiiiiggggggghhhhhhh_*
Henry M 
i wonder what 2019 will bring
ok....
Jake paul is a bully
Logan Paul is a person shows dead people
death is not a joke, we must respect it.
Paul listens to the song of this boy ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RmOvOknNPQ ) who dedicated it to all those people who have lost an important person in their lives and then tell me how it feels.
The biggest shock here is them saying that dude is only 22 years old...lol
Fuck off
This was not a good start for him at all kinda feel sorry but in the same time not like I'm having mixed feelings rn
Ummm this has happened to other people on youtube too but they never did something like that 
Btw I am a maverick but I have to tell the truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNlOVdTQEIM
George Stepanopalis I don't care how your name is spelled you sick creep but you stop talking about Logan Paul that way and tell your kids they are stupid liberal Jake Paulers or whatever type of messed up kids they are coming from a father like you. 
I honestly just want all this drama to end. I want it to go back to how it was before with Logan making vlogs that made everyone happy. There used to be only hate comments from bored nine year olds with internet access, but now hate comments swarm his page and the whole internet actually. I just want the happy and drama free Logan Paul vlogs. I honestly miss the old days.
fakcu gais
First i ever heard of this  ... so ill say RIP to the victim then.
Why wosendt Logan that body
Omg shut up everyone
He is an amazing youtuber,he made a mistake we are not robots.wow he made a big mistake but so does everyone 
I hate the people that would hate on him,he not trash or an idiot so shut the fuck up 
YouTube personalities are a problem and have no artistic merit. A talentless bunch of idiots. Viewers are also to blame for making this logan guy popular. People need to wake up, brainless society.
The suicide forest that is scary suicide is not a joke dear god 
Is he gonna vlog again
How can showing a dead body on a video be suicide awareness like tf !?!??
Thats a poor attempt to raise awareness to Suicide prevention.
consert de damso le 3 janviai 2k20 vende  privai de billai pouir le conser lol a bas e de sauce epice ?%%%%% hipster
bien dit
Logan please make more youtube videos! Just igbore those bitch haters please, you made a mistake but remember your a human so its okay
Ok i know he did a bad thing but he said sorry but dont make a huge deal still talk about but the more it gose on the more it gets worst and we will nvere forget about it.
Oh noshe said followers
It wasn't his fault Japan should close it up
Guys please!!! He's a human he makes mistakes! Please stop
Its sad how the person recording is getting more publicity than the person who took their own life
Hes in lots of trouble
No no it was not is fault
Wow he's all over social media..... Atleast he's viral xD
He said he said that he copes with stuff with humor
some one did really post a vid about finding a body they stayed the night at suiside forest
Logan paul did it to raise suicide prevention did you guys ever stop to think that he was trying to be helpful...no you didn't so please give him another chance he did it for suicide prevention not for entertainment so let kiss on him he is a helpful citizen...Thank you Logan paul for everything yes you made a mistake but in a way it was good and bad
Dont care yes he did a really bad thing that he shouldnt have done and he said sorry and he did say sorry and lets just leave it as that because there are going to be people like yeah well he is not appropriate for children hold it right there he is appropriate for children because he makes the Logang smile every day and also makes sure that he inspires children to do the right thing even though that video that he did was wrong he said sorry for his actions
I guess team marveric prepared the dead body. Its all prearranged.
Don't give this face fuck more fame ffs.
ALLEGEDLY??? its confirmed you pathetic fuckers
what the hell is wrong with this person?!!! what in the actual fuck?!
I actually dont care about this shit but the memes are 101% delicious 
Better to attacked and slandered than ignored.
Screw yall he did nothing you pinehole
Screw you abc
i watched the vlog too so did one of my friends!!
2017 was the fall of jake paul now its 2018 the fall of logan paul

SKB Gamer glad I could help
Haley Buckley thx u
Faze Shatter your so rude you need some help
Well I fell bad for Logan
You guys need to mind your. Business he did not mean it
So just now the major media is catching on to use him. Wow.. imagine your mistakes are spot lighted like this.. That sneeze- fart you did in math class.. for millions to see. Are they trying to drive  lohan paul to suicide ???
My brother is getting annoyed of every body saying they don't like Logan it is logangforlife be a maverick 
we do not care
He's such a lier.
4.430.773e weergave.
En ik hoor bij de 39K duimpies omhoog natuurlijk.
This problem is going out of hands
15 million f o l l o w e r s
Please dont ban him
Im forgiving him. Logan paul is one of the best youtubers out there. He makes a lot of people smile and all he did was make a mistake. How about we all move on, and forget about this. The main reason im forgiving him is because god and jesus would. #logang4life once a logangSTER. Always a logangSTER.
Seriously? That's all you had to say on it
Logan why
Shut up its true people so shut up
Well he has a punchable face.
you have got to be fucking kidden me just one little mistake and it goes trading just for one mistake and now it goes on the news
It's SUBSCRIBERS not FOLLOWERS
Why was logan paul looking at a died body and he was laughing
"15M followers" do you not understand what youtube is?
Of course this makes a mark on youtube, for being the most dumbass person in the world
Twats like this needs shut down
Now, i hate ABC, how does it feel, not good so YOU THINK about that
Why would you take the video that you dont like and then post it, everyine makes mistakes, just stop
Here in s.f. our most popular attraction is the golden gate bridge also a spot known for many suicides. Now imagine a japanese version or any international version of logan paul going to that bridge and making jokes about the suicides there. Common sense would've kicked into place, if he had any, to not make light of situations like this going as far as posting it on the net for millions to see. He might have apologized but the damage was done and he gotta face the consequences.
HE IS SOO SORRYY!!!
VICE did it first and the internet stay quiet.
This asshats apology rings hollow. There is no way he is truly sorry as sanctity of life is something he doesn't understand... The whole way he handles himself in all areas is with the perception of an unsupervised 6 year old ...here's hoping the rug gets pulled from underneath him or he actually goes  away awhile to reflect on his Douchery
Ayy, non saturated colored people
He is going to hell....
I think we should all move on and give him a second chance
15 Million Followers on youtube?lol
whats messed up is Logan Paul made thousands on the video itself & then made more on the apology video!
Wat logan did was wrong but plz forgive him 
What happened in that tiny brain of his to think that publishing that would make a POSITIVE ripple? Like wtf
How tf do you think taking pictures or photos of someone who committed suicide or dead period and think its a positive matter I never watched this Nigga but yea he on coke or something
Its not suicide forest, but aokigahara
See this is why the media hates YouTube
People always make mistakes so its not his fault for laughing he didnt know what to do
You said this guy but little do you know that his name is Logan Paul
Leafy, this is your time to shine
Retarded person no mind hurts me
15M followers??
I will kill you all how dare you say these things  to logan paul humans made mistakes we all have mitakes and iknow that this is huge mistake and we should forgive him please
He said his sorry
Fake :/
this is pretty stupid in my opinion
Fuck off abc
PEOPLE NOWADAYS ARE DUMB AS FUCK ITS CALLED SUICIDE FOREST FOR A REASON WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE THERE? A UNICORN? NO! DUMBASS ALSO YOUTUBE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT THEY SHOULDVE BANNED THAT VIDEO IMMEDIATELY BUT NO THEY DIDNT FUCKING CUNTS
Booooooo abc talk about Trump he is white and  racis
I remember when Logan was a funny guy on vine
Pewdiepie: *says n word*
YouTube: fuck you
Logan paul: *shows dead body*
YouTube: MY NIGGA
1 like=FREE LOGAN PAUL
Wrestling Guy Then make all dislike seen again!
I hope that video that he made of this is deleted. He dances on the street  isnt normal and kid watch*
his channel and kids support him only
Umm nvm its deleted
Yah he's crazy
How come Im just hearing about this sack of shit right now , you can burn in Hell Logan . Disrespectful fuck
Everyone knows he made a mistake but he also apolagised
logan really messed up but people should not be total jurks to him because of some stupied mistake
Omg you people dont know the story!
When you call them followers instead subscribers
I hope you fall off the planet you disrespectful assssss hole. I hope they shut your youtube channel down.
Finally decided to watch this and see what Logan Paul did and im not suprised that Logan would do something so stupid
Nobody's perfect. We're just humans.
Let's hope he gets help.
What he did was disrespectful, and it will make us Americans look bad in Japan and their culture. His immature ass wanted more views for his gain, if the suicide person made that choice that's their personal view and it must be respected. Logan Paul is not cool he's a Dick.
A popular MORON...
why can't this be reported?
He's a human dude.ur all not perfect.i think u all can do that also
it took a video of laughing at a dead person for you people to realize this dudes a useless, worthless piece of shit?
I dunno what makes me more sad, the fact that this guy i didnt even know before has showed a dead body on yt and laughed about it or the fact how some morons are still defending him?!?
the only reason hes laughing is because he is in shock
he said he "wasn't thinking right" but he had the time to rethink it after editing it and waiting for it to publish...
Gangsters killing people, Cartels chopping bodies, kids doing drugs or using the ouija board cops illegally disrespecting the america citizen or resident  rights  or killing innocent by standards  and social news media is OK showing those clips for parents and kids to watch even if they blurred the images and a YouTuber by the name Logan paul find a dead body in japan and post it on his channel to show everyone that has never in any YouTube channel caught a live dead body on their vlogs then he removes it and apologized cuz he  knew it was wrong and everyone is hating him people who blame Logan Paul and not the news then you guys are bunch of idiots for judging over one dead body that was captured on a vlog from the YouTuber Logan Paul instead of blaming him blame yourself letting the news corrupt our mines to post things on live media without a thought...tell me this before replying to this comment.....so the news is ok to post these kind of stories or pic or videos of what was happens around the world and lie about what really happen then assume all they want to make the news real or make Logan Paul a bad person for posting a dead body on YouTube  do you think its ok for them to say what we can or can't do when they're the one who started the whole posting bad influence images of the world for everyone to see even kids?????
so what doesnt show that there is an actual dead body there just a fire truck no cops or ambulance he is the best person on youtube ive ever watched apart from jake paul
Nooo he removed the vedio whyyyyy
its 20 on trending
These kind of people make me sick. He and his friends didnt have a ounce of realization that it was fucked up and disrespectful thing to do while editing and uploading that video.What kind of mind these people have?
Fuck Logen Paul
Filming a body is one thing but making fun of it? That's ignorant.
Not a growing up experience. why do adults look at younger people like they are aliens and when we do some dumb stuff. "oh it's a growing up experience". WELL I MIGHT BE MENTALLY 30 IF I KNOW WHATS RIGHT AND WHATS WRONG. btw im 16 #hashtagsSHOULDbeDeadnow
logan is the best its not his fault
at least he found the body and called cops so that the body could be sent to the family
the family might have thought that the guy just ran away
that guy was crazy and coward not logan
15 million "followers"
that was quick
he is incredible popular
pretty sure all those ppll talking about him .. dont really watch youtube video even
What a fuck face
Atleast you guys understand
Stop. It was a accident he did not mean to show it can y'all show some respect for some you tubers
All that maters is he deleted it and he posted a apologize video
Jessica Marler 1.since when is laughing at a dead body considered a mistake?2. you said it yourself he's 22 an adult he should of known better not laugh at a dead body cause it's disrespectful to the person who committed suicide,the person's family and everyone that knew.3.He should have never uploaded the video in the first place.4.mistakes have consequences the consequence for doing what he is is losing his YouTube career.
Chill guys, most of Logans fans are what, 10, 12? (Or have the maturity of 10 year olds.) They don't know any better.
Show some respect for youtubers? How about show some respect for the dead you fucking simpleton
Jessica Marler yeah but an apology  is not enough you donr know what that mans family feels like right now i dont ethear but its nust wrong and i dont think he should be forgiven
HE LITERALLY SAID IN HIS APOLOGY VID THAT HE AND HIS EDITOR THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE POSTING THE VIDEO THAT WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT he had a choice and he made the wrong one
Apparent suicide victim
Never heard of this idiot before
#TheFallOfThePauls
lol. suicide victim doesn't care. he's dead
In Japan.
People allowed his terrible behavior.
In USA.
People shoot him.
Please don't come japan.
Omg I thought it was fake but it wasnt
Watch the post by "That Japanese Man Yuta" on Logan Paul to understand what he did. He also went to a temple there, disrespected it and got kicked out. That channel has clips of all this guy's posts while in Japan. It's hard to believe this guy's "apology" and his noble intent to bring awareness to suicide. There's also good commentary by PewDiePie.
He faked being shot in front of his young fans, "blood" and everything, for jokes. He also disrespected the Japanese culture multiple times and made racist jokes on twitter. Why did he apologize again? Everyone knows he didn't mean it.
He's trying to bring down the house everywhere he goes!
Teetwo Dev I have
He did it for views. Views=$$
thank you for bringing those up -- people seem to only keep in mind about the dead body thing and not about the other rules he violated.
Haha, he said his "latest content" was his biggest mistake? No, ALL of his content is a fucking mistake. HE is a mistake.
I d1dNt d0 iT F0r v1ews
AWARENESS FOR SUICIDE
ALL THE FUCKING LIES A 5 YEAR OLD KID CAN MAKE UP TRY HARDER BIMBO
Yo I wanna see that dead body
I want him to die
Why I'm a jakepauler
C'mon guys... just forgive him, everyone makes mistakes in life ...
Like his parents did...
at 1st i was going to get mad at you. but now im proud of you for being truthful about how stupid the parents are.
No repect for Japan.
At all.
Might as well embarrass a country, by walking naked.
Not even caring for what he did.
This isn't the Western cowboy times, where they took pictures of the bad guy's dead body or family for proff of their demise.
What the hell kind of world are you in Logan Paul?
Respect Japan for what it si and stands for.
If you cannot, then leave.
Some great advice for you: Study Japan, ins and outs of it, people, culture, food, respect, laws, rules, etiquette, manners, and what to do, when NOT acting like an idiot in public.
Of course, I am not like him.
And I hope, we all can understand what he did, to prevent it in the future ahead.
Honestly...I was wanting to go to Japan, and now...makes me want to study every aspect of Japan is and represents.
And not make a mistake like he did.
Who watches this guy xd ?? probably some 5 years old
Well that asculated quickly.
Logan Paul is the new heroin of the internet.
Time to go check how many followers I have on youtube
geez what is happeng to the brothers?
Thank you ABC
disrespectful bastard and an insensitive idiot
i dont ever watch his vids
Rip him
Stop try to make him sound like a bad person because he isn't you are because you are trying to say to people don't watch him but I am still going to he is the best YouTube ever so shut up stop saying he is a bad person
so if i laughed at your dead body or his and made dumbass jokes about suicide im a good person?
I hate it when people say "Followers" on YouTube
Some people who lives complete in material things, fame, and wealth do not understand depression and why it drives people to end their lives. This prick is one of them. Never been a fan of Logan Paul and I once watched ten videos of him and there is nothing funny about them just pure trash.
He's 23 years old. He knew what he was doing and the fact the his friends with him we're uncomfortable with it and he wasn't, shows that he doesn't care.
Logan Paul needs to go to prison and logang fanboys are gonna say fuck you you fucking dumbass
What a dick. Oh well
he is a total idiot posting that. and looking such a dumbass fooling around with japanese people while he was here in japan.
LOGAN PAUL
Well that escalated quickly!
Cause of this   I had nightmares
Did she really said its a growing up experience ?? Really?! Im pretty sure disrespecting a whole culture isnt really a growing up experience.
Jake Paul started a controversy that is fucking disgusting. We now  have a YouTube star capitalising off of suicide and thinking it was a great idea. And since the news has addressed this, people who look down on YouTube have more ammunition to fire onto us. This portrays a new stereotype that people will use against us. Thanks for fucking everyone over on the internet Jake.
I haven't even seen the video.
Omgggg this is everywhere
He is full of shit
He was laughing so much for raising awareness and trying to prevent it
Logan  paul  he cool
dombass shoulda never recorded
He has made a mistake.Everybody makes a mistake.NEWS, KEEMSTAR,JACKSEPTICE, u people disgust me. IM SURE U GUYZ MADE MISTAKES.  Leave him alone
Reasons why the kids have been banned from youtube
Is all the followers of Logan gonna go to Jake Paul?
He has really disturb the whole world about posting a persons death
He's really a DOUCHEBAG!!
RIGHT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HE IS 22 A YOUNG ADULT AND HE HAD A CAMERA IN HIS HANDS WHILE IN THE FOREST WHEN HE STUMBLED UPON A PERSON WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE EVERYONE BACK OFF THAT MAN DID NOTHING I WATCHED THE VIDEO BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN DOWN HE APOLOGISED TO THE MANS FAMILY AND TOLD EVERYONE WHO HAD DEPRESSION THAT SUICIDE IS A BAD THING AND THEY SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT HE WAS NOT LAUGHING AT THE MAN NOW EVERYONE SHUT UP AND SUPPORT HIM YES HE MIGHT OF DONE THE WRONG THING BUT HE IS 22 AND YOU KNOW HE IS SOMETIMES REALLY STUPID BUT HE APOLOGISED AND GAVE A MESSAGE TO EVERYONE BACK OFF ( my opinion )
Can we all just thank this poor deceased soul some thanks for ending Logan Paul :)
The people on Twitter can shut the fuck up
Guys there's a petition to take him down. Go sign it!!
Why didn't hear about him until now. is he even famous?

This will be mark in YouTube history the most hated video..

See what ego does to a person
Dr. Chat Challenger It should have been the first thing that matters if you didn't want to look like a fool asking an obvious question and also would have saved an entire debate for why you asked that in the first place single handedly. Also I said I wasn't going to ask if you read my comment meticulously...
If you want to know (And humans always want to know) I didn't tell you because the reasons for a questions should be the last things that matter. Number 1 priority should be to spread the knowledge.
Dr. Chat Challenger You could have said that right from the beginning and we wouldn't even be talking about this if that's your reason. I'm not going to question why you didn't bother mentioning that sooner but if we are done here I am leaving and leave my blessings to the poor souls of suicide.
There is no need to fake anything my friend.
Have you ever considered, (no you didn't) that a disability like asperger autism might cause a lack of empathy and lead to such questions? But hey, if its such a simple question it surely isn't a challenge to just point out what the problem is? Is it just about the eventuality that some kid might be traumatized? And if so, why does it matter if the person was suicidal or not? Would it be less traumatizing if the person fell into a circular saw and would be ripped apart? Tell me please. Iam stupid you say? Fine I know it better and so does Mensa.
Dr. Chat Challenger If you are so called "genius" why did you have to question why filming a corpse was such a big deal? Especially one who was suicidal before he died? Such an obvious question wouldn't come from a genius, so I don't have to believe you're not because i can already tell you're not a genius. Nice try bringing up something so off topic like an iq though and faking about your score also.
This is so sad. My fav youtuber just washed his career down the drain
Ok so for me this is sooooo UNFAIR why?
Ricegum does this also he is also making FUN of SUICIDE
Yes I know Logan Paul is wrong but look... there are a lot of Vloggers/YTber that also makes FUN Of suicide one of them is RiceGum...
So y not try to remove RiceGum's YT Channel on YT also... be fair... not Just logan Paul's
World is a nasty place, get over it people. There's literally thousands of suicides in the internet. It's because of you, this why we have #NetNetruality! You people are  the reason why pop tarts have cooking instructions.
Hey stop making this into a trend ok we need logan paul shut up
OH COME ON!
i bet you were bribed by pepsi to defend this fuckhead
DENISE Riggles Listen man, Im only 9 and idc about that.There is such a thing of YouTube Kids but it is too boring.
DENISE Riggles ikr
There are probably more kids than adults that watch youtube. Not do youtube. I am only 10 and people that try to make their opinion or statement.. But please don't keep putting swear words in and out of them. Its disrespectful to youtube and a bad influence for kids that watch youtube almost everyday.
Hot water
I herd it on the radio
He has 15 million subscribers* on YouTube.
actually Logan paul has 0 followers on youtube...
HE HAS 15M SUBSCRIBERS
Logan who?!
oh yeah let me raise awareness about suicide, by poking the dead body of someone who commit suicide and then laughing about it
I hate that guy team 10 and other I hate them
He makes money from acting like a dumbass. Unless he doesn't want the money anymore... He is never growing up.
the 3k dislikes where brainwashed logan diehard fan kids
Why is a dead body a big deal
97 sedipity, I agree what you just exactly said.
You should ask your parents.
Or just think it like this; what if one of your loved ones is the one being recorded by Logan Paul.
Or you just need to be older to understand this topics.
He showed a a dead man who had a family that where looking for him who where wearied about there missing realitie only to see him being laughed at by a guy who new nothing about him
famasnathan Medrano cause its sad dude if that was a family member would you care??
That EXACTLY what my sister said when I showed her this news video! Like, WTF?
I haven't seen the video, I don't keep up-to-date with these faggots we call 'the Pauls,' I don't have depression, I don't have a close relationship with anyone who has depression, I haven't known anyone who took their own life, AND EVEN I KNOW that what Logan did was very wrong and uncalled for.
Logan's video was #10 on trending
this is now #10 on trending
i like this video more
anything for likes , hate these kids
dude you Americans need to understand the difference between news and magazine lol
*THANKSGOD* i only *-SUBSCRIBE-* *_-JAKEPAUL-_*
Its a sick world and getting worse.
What the hell
15 million followers on youtube, boi its subscribers
This guy is a total GOOF and so r his fans smdh total morons
Shes jelly that mah bois car is better than her 2013 Toyota Prius
The Google CEO should resign as he has failed to prevent Logan Paul from profiteering from the suicide video. 50,000 more subscribers in 24 hours, following a pathetic apology video while Logan Paul and Google CEO laugh all the way to the bank as more subscribers generate more revenue for this immoral moron and Google Exec. Shame on you Google/YT for your spineless behavior. Close the channel down to save your brand.
They also want to kill his character...he is making too much money!!! People cant handle it man...jealousy.
This man really got ode hate over night bruh thats wild. He turned into a CLOUT GOD
WHY THE FUCK IS THERE EVEN A FOREST FOR PEOPLE TO KILL THEMSELVES. THIS WHOLE WORLD IS DISGUSTING AND CELEBRATES IT.
460 or more days of blogging and you tell me he's not gonna make a mistake like this, get out of here
We people shouldn't forgive him he was making fun of the dead body I'll haunt him if I was dead this world is truly messed up and creepy with Lucifer and his demons
John Taylor I really wish the dead man haunt him, put him into a mental hype that he end up in an asylum and just cruelly rip his organs out
2018 is off to a *GREAT* start isn't it?!

*Tobey Marshall just wished Logan Paul to HELL!!!!!!!*
To all you Need for Speed movie fans!
Just add more fuel to the fire, if you look at his videos after the video he goes to the suicide forest, you see him vlog around Tokyo, nothing wrong right? WRONG! 
He tossed coins in the prayer box with little respect, bought fishes and left it on a taxi and dressed like a pikachu and act like a lunatic around Tokyo. He is taking advantage of Japanese peoples kindness. 
He is a disrespectful vulgar man child.
He doesn't care about shit in the video you see him and his friends laugh at the serious matter that so fucked up
I feel bad for the logangsters
he started his 2018 horribly.
I dont have enough money to see him at an event and i dont live in l.a. but i guess i can see him in hell maybe he'll plug his merch
jake paul possessed 
before:#DONTBEJAKEPAULERS
when maverick team win
now:#DONTBEMAVERICK
SHIT I GOTTA GOOO
#GETALIFETOGETMONEYBRUH
Sory bout am not in the logang
Everyone is so sensitive nowadays. Stop acting like he owes everyone an apology. Suicide happens. That's just the world we live in. Did you want him to get on his knees, cry next to the body, and scream towards the sky like "wwwhhhhhyyyy???? I'm tired of the news telling everyone how they should feel. We all need to focus on real problems.
How can Logan think by showing a dead body will stop people from taking suicide? Its horrible, god I have no words to say.
logan paul is a stupid head. id say rip his career, but he never had one in the first place. if he started when he was ten, and now is 22 with that may suubs, pewdiepie atrted around 20 (probly wrong) and has way m0re subs then him
He did a sorry video but he isnt even sorry he just cares about the Money and the subscribers. That was incredibly disrespectful what he did and I hate him for that. I wouldnt be surprised if his career ended and the mans parents sued him
Yes Logan Paul posted a dead person but he also posted a video saying he was sorry about it to he is a human and makes mistakes we all do and we forgive and forget and yeah ik suicide isn't nothing to joke about ik but he wasn't joking about suicide the fucking place he wait had suicide in the name I mean come on people stop making so much drama about this shit I mean almost every YouTube you know has something to say about this shit I'm so sick of it what's next its going to be in the fucking schools about Shit I mean just stop with the fucking drama god he is human he has to make mistakes or he isn't a fucking human I mean come on people he did one thing wrong and nows his a bad person and who are we to judge we all makes mistakes so just stop with this shit about Logan Pule
The Ultimate McNugget Nagi well ricegum laughed about rape last year and he made a video saying he was sorry and may I add he made a joke about it to and it didn't go this fucking big and Logan said he was sorry we all make mistake may I ask you something? Have you ever made a mistake and ask people to forgive you? You probably have
Drama? Kid, everyone can voice their opinion whenever they want. And THIS needed to be said. Not only Logan disrespected the dead but he also hurt and disgraced the Japanese culture which is their number one priority is respect. His sorry if you call that isnt enough to pay up what he did. He should be ban from YouTube and from Japan.
Can someone pls shoot him. Thanks. Pure trash.
I dont care about the News i care about logan why he post thats video I saw it I said OMG
him, jake paul and ricegum all need to stop. get a career.  they all suck.
I can't and won't watch him.  It was disgusting and disrespectful.  Youtube is suppose to protect kids against this but they won't.
Liz Spears he made a fucking mistake do you need to watch the video again
Liz Spears quit hating
Daniel Driscoll but it is his fault for posting it.
Liz Spears I'm sorry in going to have to disagree. It isnt youtube job to protect kids for vidoes like this. It parents. I know what my child watches bc I watch it. If I don't like they don't see it
Liz Spears 
the fuck? No. YOU are suppose to control what your child watches. not YouTube.
A lot of things going on in my head ... heres one thing, youre an idiot Why do you think its called Suicide Forest??!!
Honestly he is not special at all. He is only here because girls liked him on vine then it spread like wild fire on dry grass. He is only making so much for being an idiot. He is the next person who invents the pet rock.
God allows science to advance and encourage progress in technology. It is human who abuse it. 
Technology has all the hallmarks of an evil force. The worst injuries to ourselves and our species come at the hand of technology: atomic bombs, guns everywhere, toxins in water, mind drugs, dams that fail, marketplace bombs, persistent radiation, automobile crashes, not to mention the technologies of war  tanks, predator drones, land mines, etc  which have been designed with only ONE purpose: to kill as many humans as possible. Technologies amplify violence, and this violence is systemic, part of the agenda, built into the nature of these systems. Like an evil force. 
Suicides and mental illnesses are works of the dark principalities we wrestle against each and everyday. Be careful of what you read and follow on the Internet. #mindcontrol #goodvsevil #spiritofdiscernment #habbakuksyndrome #itsatopsyturvyworld
Fuck THIS STUFF YOUTUBE HAS RUINED MY FUCKING MIND FUCK U CHANNEL IF ANY THING YOU TRYING TO GET VIEWS BITCHES
God Logan
Logan Paul is a disgusting human being. Id be more exited to be shot in the neck at close range than ever encounter him on the streets. And after deleting the video, he apologizes. He looks so insincere. God, he makes me literally sick to my fucking stomach. These fucking 10 year olds watching him thinking Oh, well Logan Paul shot a video and laughed at the sight of a suicide victim, and If its okay for HIM to be a general menace and a shitty member of society, than its okay for me to do that too! Hashtag Jake Pauler for life :P I cant fucking believe such a horrible person exists.
FUCK AARON PAUL YOU SHOULD GO ROT IN HELL BITCH FUCK U FUCK U SHAME ON U BITCH AS NIGGA
Only those who are mentally immature would subscribe to his channel i.e., kids and teenagers. 
As he grows older he would seem less appealing to his target group naturally, while I dont think this dude would ever get matured, his popularity should die out sooner or later
Holy Shit. This is just... i don't know what to say
Logan acts stupid, youtubbers make him famous, Logan... surprise surprise acts stupid now your mad.... your fault.
QUIT GIVING HIM SHIT, QUOT MAKING VIDEOS ABOUT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HASN'T POSTED FOR THREE DAYS NOW AND HE'S NEVER MISSED A DAY OF VLOGGING QUIT MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE A BAD PERSON HE MADE A MISTAKE EVERYONE DOES SO STOP!!!!!
This was so disrespectful. Why would someone film a person who committed suicide? He said that he did not do it for views, I believe that part. But, then he says he believes in raising awareness for suicide. Hummm...... Well for someone who "raises awareness" for suicide, he sure did laugh a lot in this video. Basically, he made a joke about it. " I don't think anyone else on YouTube has seen something like this before, I think it maybe YouTube history." These are not his exact words but it was something like this. I think this is YouTube history. Everyone will remember how messed up this was. I pray to God this persons family does not see this. It would be hard not to though, considering it was on The World News. I hope this person is resting In peace.
We don't have to hear about this news to know that "he's trash"
I bet Japanese people look at Logan Paul and wonder; "How did we lose WWII to guys like THESE?"
losed is not a word
SamantaSienna MUA He just like Justin Bieber, both are not ugly but also not handsome, but overall they looks good.But you think he is ugly so I do not have a problem.
Because of a nuke bro.
SusanPlasma who are you calling good looks? he outright ugly as fuck
"15 million FOLLOWERS " 
Is there really a dead body? Because in Japan there were no news about dead bodies near that forest...
If there was, it could be a big problem. Plus there was a rule that whenever you found a dead body. You will be taken to the police station to talk why and how you were able to found the body.
My whole class is talking about this
Oh wow...
Like usual ABC News will condone this and not even state the real reason why everyone is extremely pissed off with this Dude. "Hope its a reality check for him" lol you guys are a joke. Bash the president on some careless shit he says but show sympathy for a 22 year old who mocked a dead persons body hanging from a tree. "I was raising awareness for suicide victims" my ass!!! Covering his tracks playing the guilt card.
Ugh that "apology" is just full of him making excuses for himself and trying to emphasize how "good" of a person he is. Complete bullshit
Que Mal Logan.... Soy Peruano y Recien conozco a un nuevo youtuber... Y eres tu... Y Lo q me decepciona q te Conoci con el Video del Bosque Cuicida!!   Mal Logan Mal
Logan Paul's "apology" was awful. He must think we're idiots if he expects us to believe that. What he did was very disrespectful and completely uncalled for. The fact that he states he was trying to raise awareness is inexplicably stupid. He was just trying to save his ass but it didn't work, which I'm happy about because he deserves to be punished like this. I think his channel should be removed, mainly for violating YouTube's policies and for offending thousands of people. Upon the removal of his channel he could start a new one and I'm sure all of his fans who believes his excuses will sub to the new one. But his current channel needs to be removed.
Bizkit Gaming 1 when did is say i was smarter than everyone
Bizkit Gaming 1 I wasn't saying being autistic was a bad thing the person who said it put it in a way that was a bad thing.I know tons of autistic people and they are the best people I have ever met.And being autistic isn't a bad thing they are very smart,kind and overall nice people but the way some people put was in a bad way
Haley Buckley facts* plural please use proper grammar if you assume you're smarter than everyone else.
Haley Buckley Well being called autistic isn't exactly a bad thing so the fact that you think it is sickens me, I hope you really don't mean that because that's harsh.
gammer girl "ture and not awful" are you in second grade? You clearly have no idea what's going on.
It's subscribers not followers and you are showing the bad shit not his good deeds
Haha i never liked you
Good. He was always a douche. Never understood why millions of people looked up to him.
Not trying to start fights with a bunch of youngsters but nice try guys. Hahahaha. I know many of you are passionate about him but honestly find someone else to idolize. Someone who has actually made an impact this world. Not just someone who's remembered for their silly 6 second videos and a Youtube channel. Read up. Stay educated. Stay woke.
kaexlyn Lol no hes a total douchebag, you dont just film someones dead body, zoom in, make it the thumbnail. Also his behavior in Japan was honestly shitty. He screamed like some lunatic(wait no thats what he is) on the street, bothered strangers, was laying down in the road, left fish/squid on the trunk of a taxi. Just face it, no matter what you do, Logan will still and always be a total asshat.
Anza wow screw u
Anza if u got on ur knees you'd probably look up to him
Anza Millions of people look up to him because he is inspirational to some people, he is funny and HE IS THE BEST YOUTUBER EVER!
My husband committed suicide in 2013...suicide is not a joke nor is it for people's entertainment
Kevin Eaton Im sorry that people are being mean to you.Just that youre gay does not mean youre not a person. We all should get respect
+Alternate History Zealot would if i told you i had evidence that ancient Europe was black and Abraham Lincoln was Black too.
+Shakam RaishLahab European history would be void and there'd be a ripple effect on basically the rest of history. No European Civilization= no colonization= African countries only exist= Africa, the Caucus, Siberia, and Asia are thought of as the only existing regions in the world

+Alternate History Zealot good nothing to hide please come
It's a pattern 2016 ugh hated it 2017 loved it 2018 ugh again so 2018 won't be a good year I could tell
Kayla Contortion very first day of 2018 too... that's why I hate people who say "It's going to get better now!" No it's NOT! It's just time!
Alright prepare a firing squad.
2017 : the rise of the Paul brothers 
2018: the fall of the Paul brothers. 
Please sub to me thank you ,
obviously
KD Snake lmao
So happy
What caused the rising action? Logan's life
What caused the falling action? The body
What is the resolution? Logan dropping
KD Snake NO the fall of Logan
Yeah I get it but I dont think they should have called him ignorant. Well he is for not putting a warning. He should have put a warning. Age restricted tho. Or make it unlisted. 
*GIVE ME HATE*
This kind of foreigners should be banned from Japan permanently
Samantha F and most of them are from developing countries or countries of lower living standards. At least Japanese dont. why would anyone opt for a lower living standard/quality in a country with no/garbage culture?
Marley mb Don't mistake me. I'm not asking you to. You are certainly not welcomed either. I'm talking about the 28.6 million people who do every single year. Stay where you are, stupid
cheung ero true
Shaman Raish Lahab, your race isn't the only one that had atrocities committed against them by white people. My great grandfather was killed because of some idiot with a tiny mustache and a swastika. If I had your mentality I would hate all of Germany. But I don't
Samantha F true
OH MY GOOOOD ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL
Prevention by laughing? Flucking Logan paul.
Prevention by laughing at dead body.
Dumb logic.
Francis Bumanglag i totally agree with you on that 
The Paul family has one fucked up bloodline
Work heck
15 million *followers*
OBVIOUSLY HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG BUT DID IT TO GET ON THE NEWS....AND IT DID!!! PLUSSSS IT WAS PROBABLY FAKE I DIDNT SEE IT BUT WHO HAS PROOF IT WASNT JUST A HOAX AND WAY TO GET IN THE NEWS AGAIN...HIS NAME WASNT BEING BROUGHT UP AS MUCH SO WHY NOT STIR UP CONTROVERSY. ANY PUBLICITY IS GOOD PUBLICITY
I dont even watch him lol. So I know nobody 
His apology is so trash. "I didn't do it for views. I get views." Egotistical. "I wanted to raise awareness." Bullshit.
Its not his fault. He didnt know the god damn body was there. Would you fucking like it if you found a body and you were doing a vid and ppl started making hateful comments. No you wouldnt. He has apologized you fucking thots.
Its funny how he blurs the f word but not a dead body
sounds like the video had great ratings!
I was once in a really bad car accident and when I realized it was over I laughed...no Im not evil and no there were no deaths. Yes hes responsible for posting it but the amount of backlash is too much.. I guarantee this dude and his friends remember that till they die. Sooner or later you pathetic keyboard tough guys will be held accountable! Be tough while you can..
ABC is this your way of fucking YouTubers life up we get it he fucked up but really
When you said what he said in his video. He didnt say that. He didnt say anything like that   I watched it like 10 times and he never said that
ABC making Paul Logan look good by sensensionalizing his success rather than his gratuitous content towards his target audience; children.
Ugh this is why i never want to watch any of his content!
You just committed suicide
15million FOLLOWERS...
Android Yay i bet all of them were rapist
Wtf fuck this guy
Youtube fcking ban this guy!!! Do something!!!
Woah it spreaded fast! 
About the thing on Suicide Forest,dead body that LP saw and mocking it...
Logan Paul is a bitch
Well great, now I can't let anyone know I'm in the Logang still.
#BEAMAVERICK
1:42 *slaps forehead*
My dad told me about this and I was shocked! I was like really? I saw the video when I was scrolling threw YouTube and I was going to click on it but I didn't. How can Logan do this he is one of my favorite YouTubers and for him to go Post a video showing a dead body is wrong. He didn't show respect for that body when posting a video like that! And a question I'm asking is why are people still posting videos about that vlog showing the whole scene!! That was disrespectful what Logan Paul did! He was my favorite YouTuber!?!! I am mad at Logan Paul even though I didn't see the video! You should think before you Post something that the whole world can see! Logan Paul is probably really nice and cares about his fans but once again that was disrespectful what he did! He should've showed respect by not posting that video!...
Maybe thats something that has never happen in youtube because no one is dumb enough to post a video of a dead body
Logan disgusts me. I knew a victim of suicide, and I ant believe he did that. HE IS TRASH
I've never even heard of this jackass.
what do you mean he's only 22. More like he's FUCKING 22! Should have known better. This is what happens to people who drop out of middle school
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo please just STOP he is probably depressed or something by now
And? So you are sorry for him but not the person he laughed at and also whove taken their life????
first jake now logan
his biggest mistake was winning that damn race.
I hate Logan Paul. That was not even apology
that's me chloe :3 yeah I mean, Jake ran over his fans after hurricane Harvey, and probably didn't even give a warning. And Logan smashes plates, which lots of people sometimes run out of.
Lol fans protecting the Paul brothers haha  it's true anyway and they just want views and Jake Paul is bad and mean as hell
tangsang limbu ikr
Jasmine Harmon fuck off
Jack Bidwell are u talking bout urself?
Literally never heard of this guy until about 5min ago.... I see I wasnt missing out on anything...
No, he did it to get attention. It was insensitive, the poor family. Had to endure this piece of crap. Hes an ass
you dont fuck with the logan
Nataly Olivas, he wouldn't laugh at me, because I'm not dead. If I was dead Logan paul would think it the funniest thing in the world
don't fuck with the logang you reckon? Pretty sure logan is getting more hate than love at the moment ahahahah
HFFL COMMISH hiw could you rhink that HE LAUGHED AT A DEAD PERSONS BODY!! what uf the person was you and he laughed at you
Oh don't worry, little 12 year old can be slapped and left in the time out zone... Here is an idea.. Don't run your mouth with your brain when your brain is half a walnut size
I bet the logan is already fuking with his mom
"One of the most popular stars on youtube" News companies should get it straight by now that the amount of subs he has isn't *that* popular compared to so many others. 
That being said, he IS one of the *worst* stars on youtube.
hey dude reality check u are not popular because u only have 31 subs
  growing fast due tobhis obnoxious behavior. Try to bring it to the middle east lets see how funny would he really be!
omg people who said hes growing faster than otaher people needs to think hes only getting this from vine and kids it will eventually stop so you all shut up
Added note: Speaking of popularity overall. As far as vloggers, go, I am aware he's definitely one of the most popular there.
Laurence Alleman I'm not saying he isn't popular. 
He's not one of the *most* popular, though. 
And I think it's a lot less the size of his audience that should be worried about and much more the demographic. Not only was this horrendous in general, but he posted it with full knowledge CHILDREN would be watching it. He keeps his show "family friendly" for that reason.
why is he still big?!
Allison S. everyone should be unsubscribed to him or his channel should be deleted
Awful MC idk but if i subscribed to him i would unsubscribe
There are youtube videos from around the world of conflict and wars and stuff they, find dead bodies all the time
Omg i can u guys just atop reposting his video its over he said sorry get over it
does any news station know how to investigate
almost all about logan in trending right now
Alright guys buy my murch link in the description and dont do suicide peace out
Too bad Im still watching him I wont leave him hanging
Baby Ally if that was a pun....it was terrible 
I don't know how ANYONE can defend a guy who goes somewhere named "Suicide Forest" with cameras, sees a dead person hanging there, and instead of calling the police or for help, gets his crew to FILM it while mocking and laughing.  He walking real close to the body and seemed to make fun of the whole sad affair.  You can't call it a "mistake" or "accident" when he films, edits, uploads to You Tube, makes a thumbnail and title for it....he's backtracking to save his money.  He was nothing but disrespectful to the family of the person and to humanity as a whole.  I don't let my children watch him or his loser brother and this is why... I hope his endorsements disappear as well as his channel.  There are just NO "I'm Sorry" to make up for that lack of common decency.
:( I'm a jake pauler now...
So don't sue
It's not my mom it's me
Ok fine sorry this is her Dather
Logan Paul has a little peener
I seen it at a party in Dayton Ohio once. It was decent size. I took mine out and we slapped a bit.
Your probably have a small peener too
back off
people are entitled to make mistakes and my cousin took his own life and i was not offended in anyway i was glad that he showed it i creates awareness to those u still dont think it affects anybody the news needs to keep their nose out of other peoples lives because so much stuff gets worst from their opinion
Not being offended is different for having a awareness lesson and invading the dead mans privacy and even laughs at it. I dunno if you re defending him or not. But he should man up and take down his channel.
F you haters
I saw a video where a solider gets shot with a ak on full auto and I felt bad because thats reality yet no ones talks about the deaths on the. Battlefield but yet yall wanna cry about a man who took his life on his own terms?
He knows what he's doing... it's publicity. Honestly, he was super creative. I'm impressed. The guy pushed through the barrier and did something insane. He said "this has hopefully never happened to anyone on youtube". He knows this is original. So being original alone gives him publicity, then just because of how fucking bad it is he gets more. Whether people say good shit or bad shit about him, he'll come out stronger than ever and his viewers will skyrocket. He's just courting attention. Smot fucka, he is.
I see and thats a problem. Whenever I see a small YouTuber calling out his BS, their videos are taken down yet he only gets a strike. This is a problem in YouTube and they should stop milking money from ad revenue the Paul brothers make
Yall weak asl
I already watched the video......
2018 is starting off strong
I wonder if this asshole will be on YouTube rewind 2018
A Dead body in a suicide forest. Woah!
0:36 When adults don't know 2012-Present . 
" ... 15 million FOLLOWERS on youtube ... " 
IT'S 'SUBSCRIBERS' LADY !
I don't watch him but I'm really mad that my little sister watched that video
You guys are mean
Stop bullying logan the people who hate on logan are mean and disrespectful. He made a mistake everyone makes mistakes you learn from mistakes. Everyone has made a bad mistake.
Wow... what a hypocrite you are. You call out people for bullying, then you passive aggressively insult "@qt jh". Who's the bully now? You're no better than Logan himself.
Duck Days and I'm not the one insulting  people by saying "your parents made a mistake when they had you."
Duck Days I'm not bullying anyone, I'm merely stating my opinion and calling you out on your crap. He didn't make a mistake, he KNEW what he was doing. Stop defending him.
Jerr S you are the one who is bullying you are the one who is pathetic so you can stop talking you were the one who started this conversation. So stop
Duck Days is it hard to be that pathetic and rude of a person? Just wondering
Can you forgive him,I can forgive him
Sang thuama I dont forgive him that much but I do a little bit...it wasnt nice to post a dead person on this channel but he made a big mistake and I understand that. But people have to come in and want to ruin his life over it. But Im staying out of all this drama....
The Ultimate McNugget Nagi he copes by laughing If u didnt watch his video
If he was sincere... I would've at least try to... But judging by his body language.. There is a video on this if you're interested BTW... I come to a conclusion that he wasn't as sincere... And... If you we're that man or his family... I'm sire you wouldn't have forgiven him even when he made 100 insincere forgive videos
Sang thuama  no  man no cure for this life time disease called mistake
Sang thuama Not everyone can be as easily forgiving as you. Logan disrespected a suicide victim and that is something that is not easily forgiven.
Hmm...and what does Jake Paul think about this?
if u people actually watch the video u would realize when logan paul said "have u never stood next to a dead guy before" and all that other stuff happend he also sayed that he was trying to make light of what happend not for views or anything else this is just another thing youtube hasnt fully went over so next time before u criticize someone or aomething actually know what ur talking about if u agree like and recoment on another video like this plz
no one cares about dumbness who suicides
Khalid Chalya wow!what if someone you loved commits suicide huh! Would suicide be dumb then!
Khalid Chalya the families of the people who commit suicides do. So your comment is not only stupid, but pathetic
Big deal people post pictures, videos, etc. Of dead bodies or killings and now they attack him. Please
Yeah, disrespecting the dead body by laughing at it and offending the Japanese culture making less chance for Americans to go to Japan, big deal, right?
Albert Lucero doesn't make it any better, you dope
I don't want to be a Ye now because if I make 1 mistake I'm gonna get hate
You know what you stupid haters you guys should feel bad for him cause he is a star,well,he's my star for life and you haters,BACK THE FUCK OFF!!!!!!!He didn't know what he was doing wrong and he apologized now just sub him to help him out please.He is my superstar and you guys that were on his team go back to the Logangers.
He Mocked it! He cant not get hated, Especially if hes a star!
How did his one mistake affect yalls life? It was a stupid mistake but not a big deal. Raising suicide awareness is just as retarded as cancer awareness-.- like who the fuck doesn't know that shit exist?
People are stupid these days they should suck there ass
Poor Logan  
Oh Billy no because he deserves whether he is like a Saint or not.
Allison S. Cause he feels really bad about it and I'm sad cause he's sad. Wouldn't you be sad if your favorite YouTuber was being criticized on national television
Oh Billy how do you feel any sympathy
This is bad like if u agree
The fact that youre trying obtain likes from such a horrible thing is pretty disgusting.
the paul brothers are gross. don't forget the logan paul fan in the blue shirt who said the dead man waslucky to be in a logan paul video......a little kid said that.
If your parents seen you talk like that I wonder you horrible little Brat you
mo monii no I'm on jake side only Logan is dumb if that was me I would off been heart broken I'm already heart broken now
Ben Vlogs I dont have overwatch anymore since it was on my old Xbox one
Ben Vlogs LOGANG FOR LIFE DARD
Ben Vlogs so do I but that was a joke
He doesnt even deserve 1 sub
you carry on about a body when you only need to go to the middle east and see the damaged bodies there and its your government dropping the bombs. reality check yourselves.
Lol another Hollywood sell out who sold his soul to devil for fortune and fame. Why do retards make these wastes famous for no reason who can give two shits about any of you? Stop looking up to these people as role models and read a book or focus on your own life instead of wasting time making other retards rich and famous. Jesus Christ what is wrong with society? Who gives a fuck about this guys life or what he does lol.
What an idiot.
*A L L E G E D L Y*
I think it's funny that she said: " *Teenagers* and children " watch his shit
Apparent suicide victim. APPARENT?
I kept wondering why this guy was all over the Internet with memes
calitroit45 sorry calitroit but this for someone els....
yeah and im sure your only 5years old some people may be young but some still understand whats happening
calitroit45 if their is one that sais i suck dick for free i get why
Same heree
calitroit45 he faked the whole thing the police denied claims, i debunked this in my video
Ipi Thaqi I feel you bro
I love Logan not hate him so f$&k off
+Allison S. I liked you
Keith Lim 69 how do you feel sympathy for him...oh right cause hes famous
HOLY CRAP!
Hey at least he started 2018 at Rock bottom. Only way to go is up now
FUKK u ABC NEWS U SUCK LOOK AT ME GO FU ABC NEWS
Brandon Alvarado logan paul sucks
This is for the people who dont think what Logan Paul did was bad.
He  basically danced on the mans grave. That is one of the lowest moves of disrespect.
Wolfloverfurlife hea probably gonna get haunted..
Thts wht i heard..
Disrespect a spirit
Then they haunt you?
You can correct me if im wrong...
Wolfloverfurlife 
I agree, imagine if that was your child and some YouTube star came over and made fun of the fact that your child had died
EXACTLY. COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF.
Wolfloverfurlife I'm not surprised since his fanbase is full of kid and teenagers.
Sick sadistic pos
Exploring with josh did it
Heres one thing if anyonr hates logan paul you are a fuckind thot or a asshole beacuse he apologise by hes mistakes you all make me sick
15m subscribers not followers
I dont get it are they on his side or what
Lmao he took his life 
Omg people its over just stop talking about it there is no point anymore
He made a mistake yes it was fucked up. BUT he apologized and I think he's learned his lesson from all this hate
Russell Fitzgerald oh i think that to but i think he needs more than that...
But since he's an actor and has made so many pranks who knows if he's even sincere about his apology
he only apologized because he got hate, it had to take the time to upload,edit, and post it and time to cut that part out and start again but he didnt, he clearly didnt care until people gave him hate, to logan paul, its all about money and fans
Watch the apology video, you can see it in his eyes that he didnt really mean it. he just wanted to get the hate off
I mean... I won't forgive him till the dead man and his family does...after all,this affect them the most...plus...he seemed insincere
How do you "accidentally" think that showing a dead body to children and laughing about suicide is a good idea? Grow the fuck up.
Good thing i followed pwediepie's advice......be family-friendly and respect whamen
I pray Logan makes more videos like that. rappers talk about drugs and killing ppl e every song, and a lot are fighting criminal cases right now. Also, what about Matt lauer, ABC? Your own trusted news anchor was doing far worse than Logan Paul and people listened to him ERR MORNING! put ur pitch forks down god damn, u act like you're all so pure and righteous. So what, it happened, it's done, nothing you can do now except fuck off
I think he can get a Second chance just let him
sure, but he has to pay up for his crimes first
SAVE OUR BOI LOGAN PAUL I KNOW HE DID SOMETHING WRONG BUR HE NEEDS A SECOND CHANCE HELP LOGAN PAUL!
Eww. I dont want to save as someone disgusting as Logan
Don't be mad at him he tries to get a positive result but it turn out it was not please don't be made at him
Kid, do you even know the situation?!
you guys suck logan rocks
still maybe the people should ban suacid forest
skygirl Becker no he mocked suicide
The freaking news?!?!?!
around the end he said he didn't want kids to see the body when kids were by the forest but guess what all his fans are little kids
STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM he messed up and he knows that but there is too many videos of him:(
I hate logan
So what everybody's is different
How do you define different? 
Being rude and cocky?
Bro everyone makes mistakes even you people probably
Exploiting a body on cam, have time for edit the video, uploading it on YouTube. 
That. Is. Not. A MISTAKE
Just stop its stupid hes gotten enough hate and he also hasnt uploaded in 2 days
Ya you can tell him on YouTube or any other social media but on the news thats too far he already got punished enough
People can voice their opinions all they want because what he did is wrong and he isnt punished for it.
I'm probably the only one not mad at him
Asi de tanto necesitas vistas que tienes que hablar de el
I think we should send mechanical bee drones after him.
To make you guys feel better a little after watching, uhmmm... They called Subscribers 'followers'
I like how they say 15million followers bruh ....... their called subscribers
I hate ABC NEWS
wow they cant even get the story right. SMH people got mad over him laughing and joking after seeing the dead body, not for the words he said before. Those were actually okay. He was right. suicide isn't a joke. It's his ignorance about laughing and joking right after saying that that has everyone mad. This story honestly doesn't make any sense in the way this news station is telling it.
Logan paul is the best your not
warren Cassidy do you appreciate the fact that he mocked suicide 
so they can show massacred bodies in the Oct Vegas massacre but not 1 dead hanging dude OK FUCK U
I saw this on my news :(
Leave Logan Paul alone he said sorry multiple times he did nothing to you he didn't do it on purpose you didn't do for the views he gets use it's true so just drop it and leave him alone
Kid. Just stop. 
Paul isnt an angel as you think he is.
"apparent suicide victim"
Bro, he's literally hanging from a noose in a Japanese suicide forest what the f*ck
He is a dumbass.
Stupid douchebag.
Your just getting yourself in to some drama.
People is going way to far with this  and people telling Logan Paul to die DO YOU REALLY WANT THAT?? Because you might be thinking twice of people saying stop bullying people but is all going back again to him what's wrong with you
Says this an that to raise awareness.. *watches the vid*  laugh an shout like a maniac as if he hit a goldmine..    sure karma bit him in the ass
This reminds me of jonghyun
What a fucking idiot. You dont try and raise awareness for suicide prevention by showing the body of a person who took their own life to your 15 million subscribers for your own gain. You do it by using your success and power to make a difference. He is a disrespectful piece of shit. Absolutely awful. I hope the person and all of the people who have taken their life are now happy and are resting peacefully. They deserve better than this.
AARON GO TO HELL SHIT LEAVE LOGAN ALONE
ummmmm i dont get it i read this and then look a little bit above and see she is pointing the fingers at the camera (everyone who is looking) sooooo she says u dont deserve the praise or success WTF look at urself u annoying barbie doll GEEZ his is probably one of the first mistakes LP has made and the internet like it always is has a big blast over it i dont see you trying to make a diffrence all isee you doing is posting bikini shots and body shots of urself.Stupid poeple 1:35
Fuck you all bitches Logan Paul is innocent he did shit again it was not planned
God people suicide isnt funny!
Anthony Acteopan is it hard to be that dumb?
Well we all know how 2018 is gonna start.
IM WATCHING HIM!!!!!
Once a non loganger, always a non loganger.
idubbbz. start your content cop.
Hell yeah
Selina is just another LoLifer. Grow up you pathetic fkn child. This guy is an absolute Trash human being that is obvious from ALL of his videos and not only the Japan one. The fact he is your idol shows how today's kids are the dumbest, meanest, most immoral trash of any generation ever. Logan Paul should get kicked from youtube and all you kids sent back to fkn 1st grade because you clearly haven't learned anything. You 12 year olds are the PITS OF HUMAN INDECENCY AND STUPIDITY.
Will Lahera WHAT THE FUCK IS IT TO YOU IF THAT GIRLS IDOL IS LOGAN PAUL OKAY HE IS MINE AS WELL SO GO FUCK YOURSELF.I CANT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE BULLYING OVER LOGAN PAUL BEING SOMONES IDOL
Obviously Nought and Gabrielle are stupid tweens defending their pathetic idol. You should be call LoLife ; Pathetic idols for pathetic little children.  No one over the age of 15 with any maturity would call you and this loser anything else.
Serena The Animating Psyduck it's Logangster or logang
Dude his friends were laughing too, mistake my ass!!!
HE ALREADY APOLOGIZED ABOUT IT!!!! YOU GUYS ARE SUCH IDIOTS! HE APOLOGIZED FOR IT AND WHY CANT YOU JUST ACCEPT HIS APOLOGY? IF NOT WHY? REPLY TO ME IF WHY IDIOTS
Yzzap Abellana because he did something that cant be forgiven dumbass
*watch* how easily the mass will forgive him, bunch of spineless cowards ready to forgive a liar at a drop of a sentence.

My 9 year old sister watch's this guy . Smh .  I have yet to see the viseo... because it was yanked ....... seen a video disrespecting Japanese police tho..... Smh seems like a idiot.
Didnt think before act.
He deserves to be attacked for this.  He put this upon himself and it was a sick and insensitive thing to do.  He should be ashamed of this his whole life and I have no sympathy for this BOY whatsoever.  The only feeling I have for him is pity.  Pity because he failed to realize how awful of a person he is.  Pity because he will never truly see himself as a monster until his dying breath, when someone films HIM dying.  Then, and only then, will Logan really see himself as the horrible person he is.
Yeah Logan you scumbag, we are aware of suicide. We didn't need you to make that video.
Wtf... What a disrespectful piece of shit. Why even go to the suicide forest if you're going dressed like a fool.
This is why I can't stand him. He gives youtubers a bad name
XxwolfalphaxX i know sorry im just trying to prove my point sorry
Nataly Olivas tbh that's pretty much judging a book by its cover :/
Yandere Emily i totally agree i never watch his videos cause the first time i saw his face i knew i wouldent like him but i think he  hate videos about every one who used to be his friend
why did they say he "allegedly" filmed the dead body. ITS IN THE VIDEO. Its not allegedly its hard core proof
What a terrible person.
really logon Paul
Take this off please 
they wont. if you got a problem with that to bad.
Logan Paul even before this, has been nothing but a worthless piece of shit. Seriously. I find people popping pimples more entaining than him.
apparently?
Omg... wow just wow
I mess loagen!so much I cried for hours
Is this what my kids watch? WTF? This is disgusting
What do you expect? Its called The SUICIDE Forest retards
This guy used to be me and my little brothers hero, not anymore.
Thank you .  He made a mistake and your going to be the cause of his death if you dont shut your mouth all of ya
theres other better people to look up
Emily Shields why , because he found something like so. HOW WOULD YOU REACT  he was calm and he did the right thing he showed respect and owned up to his fucking mistakes
Emily Shields i'm glad. there are many youtubers out there who are a much better influence than the pauls.
The Ultimate McNugget Nagi christian delgrosso should be ur role model
One of the most popular stars on YouTube bs
He should be ON fire. It would be an improvement.
Hex Isme lol
if this was imperial japan, 
Japan: commit seppukuuu!!!!!!
logan(butt chin): butt-butt ivuuu done nothing wrong, plz let me go!
japan: SSSHIIIIINNNNEEEEEE!!!!
Hex Isme god your homicidal
Hex Isme idk about you.. But I want to put him through what he did to the man
Its subscribers not followers
"YouTube Star" HA Yeah right...
Whoopsie daisy
Please do not come to Japan again.I hope this guy banned from youtube.
https://www.change.org/p/youtube-delete-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel
If he leave his youtube career i will miss Kong and Logan Paul
I'm glad I never followed his ass what a dumb ass... this story is just sad smh
Logan Paul sucks!!!!
if he comes to canada van a paddle him as a Mounties uniform?
Followers on YouTube Im disappointed 
15mil. Yeah thats nothin compared to the og 50mil. People can hate on pewds, people can hate on jake, yall can hate on everyone even the most innoccent like Family channels. Im just saying this.... Dont hate the player Hate the game. I admit logans video deserves hate but sooner or later this will all pass and something else will happen that will grab everyones attention
Im dead man! Im done
I seen the video when Logan posted it and it made me have anxiety really bad and crying, I couldnt even sleep for two nights.
Logang for life
So it's not ok for Logan to make that video but it's ok to cyber bully him and ruin his entire life? Alright.
Ketchup Central ONLY 22? He's a grown ass man and he needs to start acting like it. Using his age can't be an excuse.
Hes 22 he should know that choices come with consequences whether its good or bad he made a choice it came with a bad consequence and he has to deal with it
The Wild Ones he should've been taken off and banned from YouTube... I mean... If they found YOUR dead body.. You wouldn't want it to be shown to millions of people... Maybe there'd be maggots inside your eyes and decaying skin... Such a pretty sight, right?
@ketchup Central Consequences aren't supposed to be fun. That is the whole point otherwise people would be doing wrong things all the time. That's why you shouldn't do something so stupid in the first place. And 22 is well over the legal adult age. You are responsible for your actions whether you like it or not. Saying he is only 22 is a retarded excuse. Justifying this for being 22 will lead to theft or murder being justified for just being 22. It does not work like that in the adult world. The age of the adult is a non-factor when you make a mistake. He is not a child even though he has a child's mind.
maybe if his bullied enough he might feel the pain of depression others have gone through.
Mistakes happen, Logan apologized and was very sincer about it#LOGANG FOR LIFE!
Jenny Tsang Ik its rude. You don't have to tell me
JUSTIN FERNANDEZ ok that just rude 
You're right, mistakes do happen and one of them is you. Now go back to ur momma's womb you retarded underage idiot.
"I didnt do it for views. I get views" Yeah right what a sincere apology.
Shadow King  boy shut up, He literally had all the time to not put the dead body in his video but he choose to put it anyway, he use the dead body as his thumbnail he acted like a fool around the body, shove the camera in the dead body's face. Stop it.Get some help.
GO LOGAN DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE RUDE PEOPLE
No, he must listen.
What he did is a vulgar act and should be punished
GUYS LEAVE HIM ALONE JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE
He said sorry. now people hate him now but he said A SUPER sorry he will be better plz stop saying he is stu**d for that it was an accident plz forgive Logan
I feel no sympathy for him
Great way start 2018
Look,if you hate...you just want to hate..
If look like...then you just like him...
Have your own opinions!
Only reason he laughed was because it was first time seeing a dead body and he didnt know how to react.
Let him take his time..
A five years old....
A FIVE years old can tell its bad manners to laugh at people! Dead or alive! 
This is no mistake, he has consciousness when he is filming and exploiting the body.
logans fine he didnt do any thing wrong
it was a mistake
That's news? Why get triggered? As long as there's been people there has been suicide Logan Paul didn't invent it. We all should be celebrating suicide that's just less stupid people in the world
I still like him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mirnqp2e1bg&t=11s
*CLICK THE LINK TO END BULLYING TO END SUICIDES ITS A VERY IMPORTANT MOVEMENT*
Full vlog
https://youtu.be/UNSMVYIE7LU
You know its serious when your mom shows you this and asks if yoy watch him
Logan didnt do anything wrong I guess people are to stupid to realize it
Who are these stupid people you speak off? I guess youre just a little kid. 
Hes an adult, he should have known better. He went to the SUICIDE FOREST where he can likely found a dead body.
Well I still like him
American's are openly envious and jealous of Japan which they simple unable to dominate. Their open hostility towards japan produces people like Logan Paul. You have no one else to blame but yourself America. Yes we know about your bases in Japan, we also know you "won" the war with Japan but they are still better than you.
Am not a loangane fan but we all know he fucked up huge but I don't get why every fucking body is bullying him I have already watched 5 videos of people saying he is horrible he is a extremely fucked up.but think of the good he has done for people he had been part of the wish foundation he even flew one of his fan out to see him talk to him have fun.an I just don't think it isx right to bully someone when they know they fucked up yes he shouldn't put up in the first plase but he did take it down he did say a sorry video an people saying he doesn't care he just ended his YouTube channel he took down himself.so I don't get it why would you say he doesn't care when he clearly does when he gives up ever thing he has worked for just like you have.i will never understand why people pick on other people.#no bully on YouTube
I'm 10 years old I don't think Logan should have been accused for putting what he put on a vlog because people show dead victims on the internet or TV if companies like ABC and other channels on social media or the news show dead bodies so why can't Logan Paul show these images.I will no longer watch or see information about you and all the social media platforms that will accuse Logan Paul for what he did. goodbye
Because this is too shocking even for 10 years old like yourself. 
He is setting a bad example to mocking the dead body to this children.
The other f off as well your not in it
Had no idea who he was till now
Growing up experience my ass. Im 21 years old and I know not to do this shit. Anyone with half a brain cell and an internet connection could tell this was wrong.
Calum Sween I swear... Even my friend that was 14 wouldn't do this... Even my cousin that was 11 wouldn't do this... In conclusion... His brain is even less developed than an 11 year old
FUCK YOU  DON'T BE HATER'S
0:33 he has 15 million followers on YouTube me DUNBASS ITS SUB SCRIBERS!!!!!!!!!
Em busca de fama e dinheiro (mais e mais)
Another disrespectful fucking American in Japan. What else is new. Punk!
Omg wtf
We need extreme vetting on white ppl ASAP theyre out of control
renatoyutub first of all, I hope you are kidding
I really didn't see that big of a problem with the video. I think people are tripping.
MrLeewhite336 if he was out looking for ghosts he should NOT have filmed the body at all and DONT say it was an accident because he said it himself that he and his editor thought through it before posting the video he had a choice and he made the wrong one his fans need to grow up
You should be happy we can't see how many dislikes are on comments...
Jerr S I didn't say I didn't see a problem with it I said I didn't see that big of a problem with it. That meaning this big of a backlash, and talks that he should be ban from YouTube.  Obviously YouTube did see that big of a problem with it or they would have took it down themselves but they didn't Logan took it down.  And we all no YouTube will take something down with the quickness.
universeeqlight wait. DId Logan kill that guy?? What are you talking about?
The Ultimate McNugget Nagi he wasn't looking for dead bodies they was going out there to camp in what could have been haunted woods.
Logan making a YouTube channel was his biggest mistake
thats just fucked up big time
YouTube have me on my second strike because of a bump fire stock and a potato cannon and this guy got his video of a dead human being trending. YouTube is greedy and unfair
Man boy you know it's bad when Big Shows talking about YouTubers Youtubers of all the people who you know it's bad too bad really bad like bad news pause out here and is even ABC one of the biggest YouTube channels I mean not YouTube you know what I mean TV channels so that means Logan is man this is big people all over the world but they want to go to his house and hurt him a lot and those are my friends and I want to run and I heard a lot of that don't think about the whole world especially Japan in Japan publishes it so that means yeah I just wanted to say something and I'm using voice chat for this
I dont know who he is, so I must by old
Ya'll should blame yourself for making this garbage of a human being even popular. Logan is such a WASTE of money that you guys are endorsing on. I too dislike this guy no matter what reason it is.
Actually he didn't show the body
Bullshit.
He even puts it on then thumbnail for clickbait.
khalila loves squishies he did
This is the first time I ever see him make this biggest mistake but give him another chance
Pauler*
Thats why Im not a lot gang Im a Jake paulet
i know why he did this,cuz of "new year new me"
If Logan Paul was a stock it's about to be down 400% and stay there. Lol. I'll be surprised to see him bounce back from this. Alot of heat right now
WHAT ABOUT TFIL AND ETC. THEY FOUND A DEAD BODY
He made a mistake everyone  makes mistakes he didnt know he couldnt do that #logang4life
That was not a mistake.
He walked into the forest. A Forest where a lot of people die. Found a corpse and laughs at it. Hes such a disrespectful man .
F YOU
PLEASE STOP
They forgot to mention how much of a disrespectful idiot he was being. 
damn he even on the news you funked up so bad logan your done
You mean this guys has more subscribers than you guys
Im done with television!!!!!
He has 15M *followers* on YouTube. 
Dang u old its called subscribers
Raise awareness my ass.
This is the one time that I am actually happy main stream media is attacking someone on this platform.
They're still being really soft about it though. "This is a growing up experience."
HOW MANY OTHER FREAKIN DEAD BODY VIDEOS ARE ON YOUTUBE AND HOW MANY OF THOSE PPL DIDN'T APPOLOGIZE???? You tell me.
stop woman because you new on the news
We forgive Logan!
so he's still cool
BRUHHHH
teenagers xd not in Australia all i know is a few 8-11 year olds who watch him who dont really know what logan paul has done
YouTube STAR? The bar is set pretty low these days...
why is this stuff still trending TBH.
Never heard of this dude until now.
Idc Im still Logans for life
"I did it to make a positive influence" *wears a toy story hat
His apologie was a lie
I thought Jake Paul have low standards
Yes you just said he is just 22, he didn't know what he was doing, you better give him a second chance everyone makes mistakes in life nobody is perfect
Everybodys fucken actin like they never made a mistake
Ha followers its subscribers
Alright alright we dont need to make it a big thing dudes
Ye you guys can't forgive people because most of you want to put him down because of your jealousy
So fending off them haters is just telling them they are jealous? Get a better argument to defend your idiot idol.
I think that Logan Paul didnt mean to find the body, and it was a total accident, but I agree that he should have edited it out and should have been more careful of what other people may think or feel. We dont know his intentions were because we are not Logan, and should stop putting words into his mouth. It was a very very bad decision, but we cant do anything about it. If he does do something like that again then yes he should be punished, because he didnt learn his lesson. But he should be more careful on what he posts. Logan please be more careful. I dont agree with everything you do, but I have many friends that adore you and you inspire them, even me sometimes. Just please be more careful.
He is a cool youtuber or he was
Every one makes mistakes like wtf
HE SUCKS
Logan's career committed suicide when he uploaded that disrespectful video
Fuck these youtube jerks, makes the world more stupid with trash content
DISLIKES ARE FROM LOGANG TRUST
15 million followers on yt? 
he didn't know there was a  dead body or if it was alive 
Its called a FUCKING SUICIDE FOREST FOR A REASON AND ITS NOT WHERE TOURIST CAN COME FOR ANd MAKE VLOGS FOR IT its the foreigners decide to make it a tour place AND ToTALLY A MAN HANG ON THE TREE WAS NOT DEAD HE WAS NOT MOVING SO FUCKING THINK PROPERLY AND SERIOUSLY CAUSE suiCIDE AND FILMING A DEAD BODY and joking ABOUT ITS NOT A FUCKING GOOD THING to do
Regardless of whether he knew or not, he still willingly edited the footage of the victim, wrote a description, created a title drawing attention to the victim etc.
If he really wanted to make an effort for suicide prevention hed donate some money that he earns from his overpriced merch to a charity, and actually show some respect to victims of suicide and their families
Nothing about posting that video was an accident
He knew. It's suicide forest of course there's a dead guy. Also you can tell if someone is dead or not.
"I didn't do it for views. I get views. I did it to raise awareness." What a crock of shit, the guy even says in the video that this is a moment in history because it's never happened to anyone. Yeah, totally not thinking about views. Only the truly crazed fans will still continue to support him.
I was 4 second from bying merch then I got a notification and called it quits I thought I loved him but that changed very quickly
Thought it was positive? His videos are all negative
LOOK GUYS IF TOU WERE PART OF THE LOGAN YOU WOULD KNOW HE DID NOT MEAN TO SHOW THAT AND WHY SO CURL ON HIM
I mean him
I watch win you not savage
All I see is Logan paul this Logan paul that just give it up dont focus on the past but focus on the future 
If you are not an old italian man, no one should wear a pinky ring. What a douche.
Logang
Not trying to be rude but he should go to jail....
I hope Logan and jake paul get shot in the fucking head
Can you sub to me plz
It's pathetic seeing all these children on here defending this piece of trash. Hey parents, actually take the time to look at this D-bag's videos and tell me afterward if you feel comfortable with your children watching him. If after all of it you still are, congratulations on being part of why this country and world are turning to sh*t.
That dumb ass is not sorry.
POOR LOGAN
15m follows on YouTube? Subscribers? 
If you wanna talk about YouTube then learn what it has to offer
He qoxt youtub but r.i.p logang  the news why iam at his home his cyeing rit now his bro is upsad and mom and dad
Nut why did he do it
DO NOT BE HARMFUL TO LOGAN
Then he shouldn't be a toxic idiot in Japan.
WAY TO START 2018
The guy is a huge Piece Of Sh*t
longan for life
The internet loves to get outraged over things they know deep down they actually don't give a shit about.
He calls that anpoloagy
I'm a kid 12 year old I'm Aloud To watch Him Finding A dead body in the Suicide Forest but 6 to 10 maybe it isn't aloud to watch that yet
We still have hope guys, Markiplier hasn't done any stupid shit...still hope...oh and all the other cool youtubers that have more than 10mil subs...still hope
One of the most popular he wishes.
he said sorry
point out
ok what the FUCK was that apology. "I didn't do it for views. *I get views* "
seeing the downfall of the Paul brothers has got to be one of the most satisfying things
That fact makes me happy
When they are BOTH of Youtube it will be like Heaven.
#JakePaul
We are aware now aren't we.
Damn the propaganda is REAL
Your dust
omg people die... no way!!!!!
Apparently killed themselves...??? I don't think there's any debating that. I thought Logan Paul was an absolute douche before this video but after this I genuinely hope this absolute tosser is removed entirely from YouTube.
#save logan Paul
Theyre called subscribers
Laughing at Suicide IS NOT A JOKE
Pewdipie is still better
>Pewdiepie says the n word
>everyone hates him
>Logan made the most offensive and lowest thing ever on cam
>Everyone can make mistakes
What I mean is, at least Pewds take this as a man unlike Paul who hides behind YouTube and still get the reputation of his brainwashed fans.
SUICIDE IS BAD-ASS.
God and I thought this year would be ok....Also ABC next time you do a report on something like this, dont cut out at least 2/3s of the valuable info. Especially on terribly written apology letters.
Heartless karma
How is Logan Paul gonna raise awareness by laughing and grinning because he found a dead body its unbelievable what people do for views these days
At least the dead person made it in a 15M subscriber youtubers video
"He's only 22"? Give me a break. HE'S 22! HE'S AN ADULT.
Well hes starting his year off just 
Well you know
Why are y'all blaming him, he gave a warning in the beginning of the video if you read it yall wouldn't like to see what happen but nah they decided to ignore the warning and see the video so it is y'all FUCKING FAULT
Um no. Showing the footage at all was extremely disrespectful. 
That man was a living human being just like you and me. A human being who was in a bad enough place to take his own life. 
And I can understand reacting strangely to shock, I can understand forgetting to turn of the camera. 
But he had to take that camera back to the hotel room, spend who knows how many hours editing it, including blurring out the face of the body, and then upload it online, all without realizing what a horrible action that is.
His apologies also came across as very insincere. And even if they hadn't, apologizing doesn't magically undo what he did.
The news just need something to talk about like its over he said his sorrys so you can stop talking about it 
No were not Logan Paul is a messed up shite ass
CAN WE ALL FORGET ABOUT THIS AND FORGIVE HIM
Oh my god I knew this was gonna be on the news, Logan is fucked and I'm so happy about it...
Omg just get over it it was one stinken vid
He should be baned and baned on everything
This is why i watch stuff like calebcity because they are funnier
Youtube removed the video
Didnt they?
elijah Faylona Because that's their golden boys they making tons of money because of them which makes me sick even more to the whole situation
kevin orlando plus a lot of youtubers who made videos criticising him got their videos deleted or got a community guidelines strike. Just shows how youtube is protecting 2 of the worst youtube stars ever.
Logan removed it. Not the youtube itself. And guess what? Youtube put it on trending and that's make me more furious. Suicide is not a laughing matter.
MsLilly200 youtube didn't do squat, they manually reviewed it, didn't apply any sanctions to the video nor his youtube account, they even posted it on the trending tab, really shows how YT favors certain types of 'creators'
MsLilly200 he got no strike
My God have mercy on his soul, because this is unacceptable
I know but who thinks he should go to prison
Brooklynn Lambert lol u are stupid to
abrolegend pro345 right like seriously
The annoying ginger he says hes sorry tho and he actually means it !!
Perenara nah 
Can everyone stop calling each other names and wash your filthy mouths?! I know it was a bad thing but it sure was nothing to get worked up about?!?!
You are so stupid Logan
Parents do not let your children watch this man
Haha good i hope ur dream dont come true because he is a idiot and why sis he go
I don't care I love Logan I almost met him but now my dream might not come true 
What do you mean
Rosita Hernandez This is cancer
Who thinks that he should go to prison
I think he should
Mario Cerata what
The annoying ginger me
Aaron Paul shut the fuck off
Funny how he talks about being an actor when obviously not many people in the industry like him or his brother. Theyre blacklisted.
  I said in the industry. You obviously cant read.
Yeah....not many people like him...nahhhh...(15.000.000 subs)...Nahhhh nobody!!
faye mcarthur the thinning was a movie produced by YouTube (of course hes gonna be in it) and thats about all hes done. Hes never going to get into hollywood especially after this stunt. You have actors and producers tweeting about how disgusting he is lol
G Venchy really....... 
Nelson Murillo the stuff that he makes are better then yours..
. so dont talk to him like that.
Yep i agrea but why id he do it
Who to hate more? Outrage culture or Paul Logan?
That is not fair you news people are dick head
You laughed when you saw body hanging! You f@*'' joking.  How can you be role model for young people?  Your career is over mate
Wait..... So why everyone hating logan? (I dont like jake or logan if u think that)
Edit: i know why now
John Zhou ik why now
wow logan should be banned
ooooooooooo ok
did you even watch the fucking video. It explained why everyones on logan's ass
Fingers if your asking why they hate him ill tell you. He went to Japan in the suicide forest. Be foind a body but he did not cut the part out. He put the dead hanging man on the thumbnail and was laughing and making jomes about it.
How dare he thats rave his account should be deleted put shame on him
Well i forgive this guy
Noooo!!!!!!Bad start of 2018 for logan
He is such a peace of crap I hate him since he started youtube
There is more shit in youtube it's just somthing else to moan about I don't find it difficult to watch it was the suicide forest, what about all the videos that show people being killed,kids being bombed with blood and dead bodies but yet watch them its war , it's ok ? You people see a dead body and it a world wide outrage ! DRAMA! Don't watch him of your gonna complain      .
15 million followersshe means subscribers
Y'all are fucking pussies
Fuck off news logang4life
What an idiot
But yet he still has 15 million subscribers.
I feel sorry for this children more than the immature trash that is Logan Paul
sadly, most, if not all, of his subscribers are blind loyal fanboys and fangirls that are under the age of 14.
I never liked Logan Paul 
Cat Face yea DAVID dobrik and liza koshy
Cat Face same I don't like his brother either
Cat Face his brothers a bigger ass
me neither I just found out today he he was!!!
And still nothing has happened to him.... Smh
Stop Logan. We all knew something would happen. Thats why Im with Jake.
shut up Acb
Wait. Was the body a really dead?!
Nobody is aloud to say anything bad about him without a huge crowd of 11 year old girls losing their minds and going off on everyone 
Rice wouldnt have done something as ignorant as that like Logan.
*Let the hate comments begin*
Clorox Beach yes you are totally right
Shaun Adams he is not rice so if you want to hate go some where else
John Doe I Know your CRINGE dont have to say it
The cringe
Wolf Lover66 Omg yas rice is such a show off
Your nothing but a shite ass while defending Logan
there can subscribers
He is still young he is 22 this is going to follow him for the rest of his life
Shut up elk
2018 is gonna be worse than 2017 on YouTube
When titanic crashed into iceberg it sink.
You know what I mean?
2018 is gonna be epic...
Pray for him ...All we can do is pray for him and lost souls... With Love
it is okay you are still my favorite youtuber
Omg can u guys stop!
Just because he made one mistake doesnt mean you have to put it on the news
Wow great start to 2018 -_- 
Look i still like logan paul but seriously great start to the new year... 
Come on logan u could have been as famous as a singer but this can pull ur career down and do u know what happened to Melanie Martinez??
I never here from her no more for what she did and just like u i still like melenie but in this world 
One mistake and u are done...
I call bullshit bc logan did nothing wrong abc news is a fucking a fake
Welp we can all say that 2018 is the worst year for Logan paul
I can't stand that Logan laugh at Asian dead man. I feel really sad because as an Asian American, I got a lot of discriminatory laugh in my life, and seeing this youtuber doing this is just adding it to my pain.
Jake paul helped those people who were stuck after the storm so you act like a 1 year old
modern America where we make offensive school shooting Holocaust and 9/11 memes about the deaths from thousands to millions of innocent people but bitch about 1 death from suicide in a YouTube video this generation is such a fucking joke
Wow this is in NEWS TOO HOLYYyyy
This is outrageous My sisters watch him and they are only fucking 12 years old. I am glad that this has been taken down but now he needs to be taking of the internet so that a messed up person like him doesn't mess with the minds of our young viewers
where is this video i didnt see it yet
If you want to this stop like
Worst Famous Star On Internet everyone unfollow logan  from every app
I dont think so. Yeah unsubscribing to him is a bit too unnecessary. 
He should be banned from going to Japan.
Leo Merryman No Hater Im not hes the best I dont care I forgive him! Hes really sorry maybe you should too and stop hating on the savage dude
He's followed by teenagers? Fuck, the oldest person that likes him is probably 9.
Leave jake alone he does not deserve this tell YouTube yo take Logan Pauls channel down leave alone jake Paul
i don't know him.
Take all that money and give it to people who really need it and deserve it! Thats all I have to say.
Lol everyone hating on Logan either wants some attention or came from pewdiepies video, its soooo sad how a YouTuber like pewdiepie tried to roast Logan like just stop
>comes from Pewds vid.
Ok you lost your credibility.
I come from Gaijin Goomba, a man whos getting Foreigners and Japanese together. And Logan Paul RUINED that bond by proving Americans to be disrespectful fools. You are part of the problem if you cant seem to see the consequences Logan made when he uploads that video. People have  less chance to go to Japan now that they are careful of idiots like Logan will ever come to their country.
Going into "Suicide Forest" and filming dont you think he would have thought, "YO THIS IS SUIDICE FOREST THERES PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO KILLED THEMSELVES HERE." Yes he did think that. Wanna know what he did with that thought? He recorded, edited, AND posted the video with the dead guy in the thumbnail. None the less he made jokes about the dead guy. His so called "Apology" was as staged as a clown video. He was reading something off-screen. How is this not his fault for posting it? I'm sorry kids but later in life you will learn something called common sense.  Are you mentally challenged?
Andrew Dealba they are not trying to roast him dumbass. HE SHOWED A DEAD BODY ON VIDEO AND MADE FUN OF IT! IS THAT FUNNY? NO! YOU FUCKING DUMBASS.
Logan is only human and it was a mistake he didn't know how to react oh yeah its not follows it subs If u take logan away from logang the biggest family on YT a family will go down with him He is not a idiot he is a hero he puts a smile on a child every morning
logan Paul is a piece of shit
Logan pale is the west ever
Stop it Logan made a mistake
So many losers 123 So the mistake was he recorded the dead body, edited the video, and uploaded to YouTube, right?
Damn people forgave everyone else for their mistake and got over so do the same for LOGAN PAUL why cant you get over it and forgive him
Everyone who is hating on him f**k you Logan didnt know better yall haters are jealous and crappy fans for him though yall are good
How the fuck do you not know that's not okay? Even the one questionable video aside, the rest of his material from Tokyo showcases the same levels of disrespect and obnoxiousness.
Nate Fontenot Ur fucking stupid
Nate Fontenot yeah a 22 year old man didnt know that making fun of a dead body is not humane....
Wait "15 million followers on YouTube" am I hearing this right
Unna Tuvshin Yes u r
And you know what all you news channels you want attention because you found something that you can keep going on and on about just STOP, Logan already said he was sorry and for all the youtubers who are still posting about just stop because you guys want attention to.
Want attention too? So youre saying Kogan is wanting attention? Hahahaha yah hes wanting attention, he apologised yes but what he had done isnt fucking something for two apologies to be forgiven with, for example, someone filmed your dead parents body during a funeral and laughed at it and posted it, would you fucking like that? Fucking no right so little kid you need to expand your mind a bit and be more mature and not stupid. Logangs too.
it's called a news channel for a reason
Going into "Suicide Forest" and filming dont you think he would have thought, "YO THIS IS SUIDICE FOREST THERES PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO KILLED THEMSELVES HERE." Yes he did think that. Wanna know what he did with that thought? He recorded, edited, AND posted the video with the dead guy in the thumbnail. None the less he made jokes about the dead guy. His so called "Apology" was as staged as a clown video. He was reading something off-screen. I'm sorry kid but later in life you will learn something called common sense. Also stop kissing his ass.
Nothing but Net Mixes He has advanced retardism
are you actually fucking retarded ?????????????????????????
Soft fuckers
Do you expect him not to find a dead body in whats called the suicide forest, yes it was wrong of him to post the video but come on
It wasn't even a tourist attraction(for obvious reason)
Plus... If he recorded it by accident... He should've edited it out...
+STAR LIGHT He deserves all the heat, not only did he film a dead body but also disturbed the public in Japan by throwing stuffed poke balls at people even moving cars too. He didn't even have respect for Japanese authority either he tossed one at a police officer over there.
Hey starlight... get your head out of your ass.  You're logic is totally wrong.
Exactly
"This is a growing up experience" No, this would not have happened if he actually acted like an adult. He's shown that's not possible.
My dad watches him. Should I be concerned?
Mario Cerata ok
Rockstar Bubbles yes
He at least did say sorry. If he didn't then he wouldn't care at all and you guys will be saying even more worst hurtful words to him.
Back off hell hole
He's a psychopath lol
The race to the bottom.   You didn't report the rest of the story.   He paid the dude to do it to be in the video.   Fact checked!
I reuploaded his video...
Logon has the best of the worts. YouTuber so. Fuck. Logon
I'm still in the logang
Luis Garcia Sup
Mario Cerata you will in nine months
Luis Garcia I dont have a sister, so Ur retarded
Mario cerata
Luis Garcia Did anyone ask
0:35 okay so you know they are called subs right?
Logan is ridiculous. Hes saying that filming up close a dead body was going to cause a positive ripple. He was so disrespectful.
For those of you who dont know about him he never even showed a dead body
I.C.E LOGIC yes he did he deleted the video. He made an apology video and you can see reuploaded videos of it.
1st drama of 2018
He doesnt try to get views he gets them
What a fucking dumbass why would you post that on YouTube
Logan is a fucking idiot
he did it for views no question.
Woohooo best way to start 2018 taking down logan paul
Hey news people. The Paul's, rice gum, and other people in that area of YouTube are fcking retarded
shut up people geez let him be
"Growing up experience" WTF 0_0
Hey ABC  and anyone who doesn't know about what other kind of crap he's done in Japan watch this video by That Japanese Man Yutahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNlOVdTQEIM&t=127s 
It really opens some clarity into this man child's ultimate problem.
#StayLoyalToLP
Honestly I wouldnt even know what to do if I saw the dead body but he apologized and is taking the time to think over his actions.
he said sorry people didn't believe him I mean everything you say is right but he's only 22 and going through this crap that ain't right
ok imagine yourself as a 22 year old that made that exact video you would want to say sorry FOR REAL to  the rest of the world not trying to create beef but he's only 22
RAKIB REZA agreed but laugh? Anything but that. Maybe he was just in shock and thinking about the same thing happening to him? Idk.
And I wouldn't laugh at a dead body no matter how nervous I am
To be fair I might've recorded, yes I'm a sick fuck I know, but I wouldn't be dumb enough to post in on Youtube.
Logan Paul is a piece of garbage.
Wtf what hell what an asswhole you don't do that
How dare him he should not have done that
Gracie,Leah,Peyton 8108 yea he makes me sick
Mystical Fox ARE U FUCKING DUMB?! u hurt my brain! he should of stopped recording but his dumbass didnt and post the video so 15 mil ppl could see
Don Cuso are you sure about that?
NO HE DIDNT I SEEN THE VIDEO HE DID NOT LAUGH HES NOT LIKE THAT SO MIND YOUR OWN BISNESS
And Gracie,Leah,Peyton 8108 I completely agree with you
Jackaxx the guy should have his channel shutdown 
It's not his fault you will make him depressed even more witch means that he might commit suicide
A perfect example of the dumbing down of society with this douchebag.
F you ABC News you have no right to talk about Logan Paul please and go F yourself because the speed of been deleted so we should shouldnt be talking about this anymore videos they deleted we dont need to talk about this anymore we have to stay positive so stop talking about him
Jerr S true
Black widow Awesome Girl it only happened 5 days ago, so people are going to be talking about it for a while. Probably for months.
Jerr S thanks but Logan Paul is one of the best YouTubers and I love his videos he make me happy in a way that no one else can make me happy I just think its not right how theyre talking about him in a shitty way because he did delete the video so I dont understand why theyre still talking about it
Black widow Awesome Girl well first of all, I'm really sorry to hear about your losses. Second, they do have a right to talk about Logan. That's all I'm going to say.
Jerr S   I do fully understand because I had five cousins that committed suicide so can you please not should hit on me and I am actually a teenager not a kid so I actually do fully understand what he had to go through
Don't you have something to care about like Donald Trump's what's going on with him like have you seen other death videos like bruh so stop like at least tell us what's tonight's weather like bruh
It was not his fault
Not his fault!!!!!!
Hahaha...No
You're an idiot. 
Where are your parents kid?
Then who's fault is it then
I'm sorry, but how is his entire situation not his fault? It was his decision to show his millions of underage viewers a DEAD BODY.  Not only did he film it and post it to YouTube, but him and his idiotic friends laughed about the situation instead of calling the police. Not to mention he poked the DEAD BODY with a stick. Then when everything came back to bite him in the ass, he claimed he posted the video to raise awareness about suicide, but yet in the video he LAUGHED about the fact that he came upon a body in which someone had committed suicide. I having family members and friends who have taken their life,  am extremely upset about the fact that this ADULT is acting extremely psychotic, not childish, because frankly, even a child would have known better.
Why ask people to subscribe on a video like this? Thats just plain wrong
Only white american do like these things in Japan.
ouch.....
Lmao rip Logan 
I still love logan paul , fuck that video
Paradise Mills me too
Logan is gay
No hes  well ur paint like ur gonna no enything
Oi, thats an insult to the homosexuals. Even they dont deserve to be associated with Logan
"apparent"
dumbfucks
Lets watch some news! *opening T.V*, what the hell?!? What is Logan Paul doing in my T.V?!?!?
There's a respectful way to cover the topic of the suicide forest and suicide in general (especially how and why the rate is so high in Japan). He did the complete opposite. That's someone's family member. He got caught up in getting views and being shocking.
I hate you gays not cuz of only Logan i love him he is the best Persson in the world. I am coming after you gays. You also did this whit banks and alissa vilet go f**k yourself i dont CARE if comment gets delitted!!!!! You gays shud fink before you post. Ppl haaave fellings you know. You YAS are the News. Last time i ed news are gona post real fings not fake. This comes form 11 Year old girl. I am Ella from Norway and i am happy in my self dont contackt me ever and dont say my name. Go f**k yourself!
Get a better role model and stop defending this douche.
And yea he might have been acting really childish but still it was an honest mistake
Omg get the fuck over it
No one likes you I wish you were never born I wish you don't I wish you guys weren't even the ABC News it's dumb okay it's done
Im 10 and Im aloud to watch any YouTuber
Wait a minute why are you guys making it such a big deal when logan did it but other people have to Nd also posted the video
Alright you guys are making a really big deal about this ok he mad a truly haonest mistake ok now stop freaking out alright you people just calm down he was doing this for a foundation ok so stop unsubscribing
From him he made a mistake ok so calm your asses down please everyone makes mistakes
i know this will be on the spanish news ime sure
Realy all the other stuff on youtube . I seen something on youtube where police let a man bleed to death on the street people ask to help him. The are thing on youtube worst then this.
NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT LOGAN PAUL CAN HE STOP BEING EVERYWHERE ON YOUTUBE??? HES NOT EVEN FUNNY
I cant believe Him I have had suicidal thoughts I dont Know this persons situation but I think I can relate
Give a like to the comments if you agree
BAD NEW YEAR FOR LOGAN PAUL By THIS  VIDEO...SAD MA FRIEND
He made a mistake and is trying to fix it , so support him and cheer him up
DARK BLADE Not a mistake to purposely edit and upload a video where the person in the video is laughing at a dead person.
Going into "Suicide Forest" and filming dont you think he would have thought, "YO THIS IS SUIDICE FOREST THERES PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO KILLED THEMSELVES HERE." Yes he did think that. Wanna know what he did with that thought? He recorded, edited, AND posted the video with the dead guy in the thumbnail. None the less he made jokes about the dead guy. His so called "Apology" was as staged as a clown video. He was reading something off-screen. I'm sorry kids but later in life you will learn something called common sense.
MISTAKES HUH LIKE
 -GOING TO A SUICUIDE FOREST
-KEEP FILMING
-CRACK SOME JOKES NEAR THE DEAD MAN
-HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
-EVEN MADE THE DEAD BODY AS A THUMBNAIL
NOW THATS A MISTAKEL
DARK BLADE It wasn't a mistake, it was intentional, and he's only trying to fix it so he doesn't lose money.
Look bro I hate him. I hope his life falls apart, I hope he falls of youtube, I hope he gets deported out of Japan because I don't blame them for kicking him out at all.
Damn it i missed the video
Subscribers dummys
https://www.change.org/p/youtube-save-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel-047f0747-88d3-4691-8a6c-387ffcd64f9a/w?source_location=psf_petitions
Go save logan
You all also like him and look up to him, so just leave it, he apologized
He doesn't seem sincere... He is old enough to know it was wrong and unacceptable... And... There is no reason to forgive him
DARK BLADE he could've edited it out
DARK BLADE ... fuck off.
Doesnt mean you like him and Logangs like him, doesnt mean that we like him, we hate him. I hate him cause he filmed a dead body and didnt edit it out and posted it. 
Yes he fucking apologised but that doesnt mean we can forgive him cause suicide and filming a dead body and laughing at it isnt something you can do and can be forgiven easily. So dont expect people to forgive him just of two apologies that are in text and one is within a minute.
DARK BLADE "what if he didn't mean it" sorry to break it to ya kid, but he MEAN it. He supervised with the editing of the video, yet he still uploaded and have the audacity to even had the dead guy's body in the thumbnail. You're watching a bad role model and you should unsybscribe for the greater good.
He did something wrong that he even apologized for, so you guys should not just hate him for that, you guys should just give him positive comments and fix the situation, I like Logan paul and his videos and I trust him
A fucking saikobath
shut the fuck up
Anthony Murano there's nothing wrong with reading a written out apology many politicians read from Cue Cards the main factors that it seems like he was only upset because of the backlash
It's both amusing and appalling that morons like Logan Paul and his fans exists.
"hate hate hate" that's the only thing you little bitches can say, keep crying your delicious fanboy tears. I hope he never comes back.
Maybe the forest should be shut down if people aint allowed to video there
HE DIDNT SAY ANYTHING MEAN OR RUDE ABOUT THE BODY LIKE IF YOU AGREE
Am I the only one who fears that Logan does something to himself ? I mean I dont like his content and the thing he did is really disgusting but seriously.
The entire internet is calling him disgusting and saying he should burn in hell for what he did and he is only 22. Im not defending his actions but give it a break guys
delete his channel. no wait typo delete him from this earth. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-w9om3Ko-A&feature=youtu.be
He's not sorry & I doubt he regrets anything. He's a piece of sh't.
F you
Many didnt even watch the video and they're jumping into false conclusions.
He's acted like an obnoxious ass his entire time in Japan. Even excluding the Aokigahara video, his behavior is absolutely unacceptable.
Including celebrities and social media stars thats why everyone is saying things that are exaggerating and making it a bigger deal than it already is
Fuck you dog
fuck my sister watches logan paul
Him and Andi did it don't just get mad at him that's very rude
15 million FOWLOWERS
He said sorry,  isn't it that enough #LoganPaulWontStop #Logang
FlowerEmblem Fair enough.
JackM2605 Let them grow up. Let them try the type of behaviour he showed and see where that gets them. Because in the real world, acting out his definition of a "Maverick" is acting like an asshole.
I'm up here I just gave up, they (The logang) are too ignorant and won't listen to anything you say and if they do read about half of what you say they will just respond with irrelevant points
It's impossible. Nvm.bye
I'm up here He know that he made a mistake and he is sorry and he apologized for his actions and for that you need guts for a man and btw my parents said "you can watch Logan but please don't watch him whit your baby brother" so they are cool and he is not a bastard you are
He didnt showed 30 million people the Video. 4M goes on his fault but the other 25M isn't his fault. All the VIPs on twitter spreading the scenery and making the situation worse. All the social media posts are the reason why so many people saw the video. He tried to stop it but you pushed it.
He fucked up
Logan is sick !
You need to shut up and mind your own business so shut up you jerks
Interesting... Back in the day.. once you "sold out" (cashing in your popularity to company advertisement, and or support there of).. you were d. o. n. e.
Logan freakin losers
Damn.
You don't get follows on YouTube
I still like Logan always will LOGANG4LIFE
He labeled the video as fucking comedy and to self-promote his gay ass merch.
15 million followers on YOUTUBE!! R u DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He's so stupid for it
deji got at sucide forest two so ya stop with logan paul and look at deji
Well, lately anything that Logan does bad, it is his "biggest mistake", and even though he says sorry, he always says sorry. Sorry doesn't mean anything, when you keep doing bad things. He thinks people will feel sorry for him if he apologises. No
The suicide forest in Japan as thousands of dead bodies in it, it's where depressed people go to end themselves. I'm surprised he only found one dead body. There's a 75% chance he stepped on a broken down skull
Logan is a stupid ass hole
Why do you care about the dead body because other people take a viedo of dead body's and you don't say nothing
fucking americans
He was raising awareness
Damn the Internet  broke
HOHOHOO SHOULDNT THEY ALSO MENTION YT PUT THIS ON TRENDING  9
U stupid biches stop exposing Logan Paul or I'll expose you guys I know something that's true about u guys too #LOGANG4LIFE
I watched the video on his channel but when I saw it I was like tf is this but good the video deleted BC there could be a child watcheing that
He has 15 million followers on YouTube. Wrong website news station
Hes like Ajit pie , a piece of crap pie
nice 2018 Star nice
IT'S ALWAYS ONE LADY AND AN OLD MAN
Be more critical with him please, i beg you. The video was taken down by youtube not by him. He tried to  make profit with it.
https://youtu.be/HePOyeq29RY
>:( so disrespectful
what a start to 2018.
Bfore this just from seeing tiny clips of him i alrdy didnt like him but now i hate him lol
I like DanTDM better:P
Like to pay respects
Like to pay respects for suicide victim 
Logan?.
You quoted it wrong DUMBASS. He said "Hopefully this hasn't happened to anyone ever on YouTube
So who actually gives a shit? So what if a dude committed suicide. People do it all the time stop acting like it's a big fucking deal.
I dont believe hes sorry
He has 15million followers on youtube ITS SUBSCRIBERS get it right!!
Everybody makes mistakes right just like what yall logangs are saying Logan made a mistake, fucking not he didnt make a mistake it was a choice, he could have edited it out and did something else or maybe not posted it and post an apology for not posting for one day but he CHOSE to post it.
Madeline Ferreiro that s what I'm saying 
Life today is all about views.
logan paul is a nice, and caring person.  He just made a mistake, everyone makes mistakes!  LOGANG4LIFE
MiniAshley I agree dont listen to them fuckers
MiniAshley Hah you need a rude awakening little one. You have not a single clue as to what respect and true hard work is. So called YouTube star Logan feeds off of children. Aka their views. That's all he's out there for. Money and fame. Can't forget the ass and titties too.
MiniAshley  Logan4life
A nice guy goes to other countries and disrespect their culture that's caring? did you see him yelling and stopping traffic, ridding on the back of trucks
So Logan Is Not Gonna post again EVER
I definitely don't believe that bs apology
The reason he was laughing because hes so positive
just saying i used to be a big fan of logan paul but not anymore cause in that video he's all about how he didnt think he was gonna find that and stuff but your walking in a suicide forest what do you think your gonna find their. apparently views is wut logan paul is thinking.
Hulk smashes the pauls
We are very disappointed Logan. Very Disappointed. 
First time in youtube? dead body? Hah! There is so many videos where you can see people killing each other and so many dead people :D Search a lil bit mby?
I hate all you haters your haters should go to hell
Theory: Logan Paul and his friends killed a man, made it look like a suicide in a place known for suicides. Recorded it for fame and to appear innocent of the crime when prints or fibers of their hair or clothes were found on the corpse.
Yeah, lets go and ruin his fucking life... jesus christ, bunch of pussies
I DONT CARE ABOUT THIS I STILL LOVE LOGAN PAUL HE IS MY IDOL
Every body makes mistakes if you don't like him or his content then LEAVE were human and make MISTAKES
I bet you $100 that logan killed him
People, people. We are all human, why do we worship dumbasses like Jake Paul
Shut up.go to hell
YouTube wanted to get there share of the video they dont give af
who the fookfollow this guy i dont understand it i hope this is hes fall
That was the worst you guys are just jealous because of all the views he gets
#AssHoleLoganPaul   he hasn't  real respect for everthing.  For him  everthing is show.
#AssHoleLoganPaul   he hasn't  real respect for everthing.  For him  everthing is show.
#AssHoleLoganPaul   he hasn't  real respect for everthing.  For him  everthing is show.
#AssHoleLoganPaul   he hasn't  real respect for everthing.  For him  everthing is show.
We are all human. We make mistakes. Its not like he saw the body and then thought wow this will make content NO HE WOULDNT DO THAT Logan has done stuff to help people through his whole career and probably life. And everyone is also targeting Jake Paul because sure he does stuff for views AND YOU CAN ASK HIM ABOUT THIS AND HE WOULD SAY LOGAN DOES THE SAME THING EVERYDAY LIKE HE DOES AND NEITHER PAUL BROTHERS WOULD BE THAT MUCH OF A MORON TO FILM A DEAD PERSON FOR VIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also Logan AND JAKE do have a passion. Their passion in yt is to do stuff that entertains people. To look kinda stupid but be hilarious at the same time. So many people do that as their jobs but they just do it over the internet. Logan isnt cruel like that. He wants people to laugh and this was a serious situation so he made it serious so no one would laugh. What if a kid saw that and laughed makes no sense because he wasnt laughing at the victim, he wasnt laughing at anyone. Because Logan is a daily vlogger and hes been doing this for a year it probably became a habit to film things. Its scientifically proven that after 28 days straight of doing something, it becomes a habit. Logan meant no harm by the video. Please listen to this..... HALF THE VIDEO THAT EVERYONE FORGOT ABOUT WAS THAT HE SAID SUICIDE IS NOT A JOKE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU THAT CAN CARE FOR YOU AND HE PUT A HELPING NUMBER AND THINGS AT THE END OF THE VIDEO! I SAW THE VLOG AND THE COMMENTS. SO MANY COMMENTS SAID THANKS TO LOGAN FOR HELPING THEM BECAUSE THEY SUFFER THROUGH DEPRESSION........ then someone targeted him and it spread like wildfire. He tried to help even tho it wasnt in the best way. Sometimes in order to make things better, other things have to go wrong....
Shakam RaishLahab 1- Stay in school kid 2- Da fuck are you talking about?
Ketchup Central only 22? You mean an adult.
you are right ii agree with you But imagine you as 22 experiencing this would you like it (I hope not) so don't do it to others
I don't have a response to that :|
you are right but he's only 22 and IS NO ONE NOTICING THE START OF THE VIDEO
Logang 4 life fuck u people everyone is different so fuckoff  he keeps me from killing my self
He might be an idiot or not, but he had every right to do it. The outrage is pointless.
fuck you bitch ass news and you just spoiled logan puals channel you bitch fucker
He's so popular yet I've NEVER heard of this guy prior to this happening!
He is an idiot
i wanna see the video
Oh please they could see it anytime
logan wasn't laughing or making jokes you must have been mistaken he said suicide is no joke and people care about you but I know it was wrong even though I'm a huge fan
apparently
The problem of logan paul not just about film the dead body. It also how he mad in Shibuya and shrine, and also disturb the local people, throw the ball to the car. You guys should see his other video taken from Japan. Right now, many Japanese are angry on it.
When is he making his next video 
I mean, I don't think what hes done is excusable. But I do believe in 2nd chances. And he DID say that it was to bring awareness to suicide....so I'm kinda stuck between it being a disgusting thing or that people shouldn't be hating on him.....?
I love how the guy said his kids like to hate watch him
Fuck this channel   logan needs our help people   we need to show people   he is sorry  we need to  show  them the logan us him we need to show him that we forgive  him and what people   say it bull  shit   we are human we make mistakes and we need to show Logan that we forgiven him  we need to be strong s we don't give a f*** about what people say we need to show him that we love him no matter what  happens  we are human and we all of us make mistakes   if you agree with me please make a comment  that's what  he needs forgiveness understand.
Well he did do it for views
olay ne 
Does Logan Paul is from US ? When a foreigners go to other country, he represent his own country. Logan Paul should respect Japan culture and peoples.
hes an idiot
wow and they call this news... they don't even have angle of the story right but rather a point of successful white youtuber gets flamed for making a vid on a VERY well know suicide site... #fakejournalist
I feel kinda sorry for him at first I thought it wan't his fault
He is only human you cant expect him to be perfect I  guarantee you one of you have done something wrong in your life
My question is how is this raising awareness for mental illness? Laughing at people who has it and took their lives? That is just sick...
Theres quite a few people on YouTube that have been to the Japanese suicide Forrest. Hes not the first.  Hes only the first to think it would be funny until people gave him shit for it.  Most other human beings feel remorse and instant regret once they find an actual dead body.
That was bad but he did say sorry
Poor Logan Paul is all over the news
does any one give a shit
" I didn't do it for views. I get views."
Boy....
This is why I have absolutely NO RESPECT for Logan Paul.
And that's the truth.
Wait ... Did he even show the persons body even ?
She said 15 million followers
He messed up, but so has the president before he was the president. And he still the president.
Where in the video did he even act like he wanted to prevent suicide? Nowhere at all! So its just some excuse that he made up. May Logan Paul rot in hell.
I'm a huge fan of scary stuff like spiritual games, exploring haunted houses and abandoned places but then Logan Paul took it way to far I've been subscribed to him for about a year and a half now but, you cant really blame Logan Paul. In the beginning of the video he said "This video contains violence and horrific images" he basically gave everybody an opportunity to close the video and he could've deleted the video before all the hate  of Logan Paul went  viral on the internet.
leave logan out of this it was not his fault
Logang for life
you all are messed up 
he made a mistake
WHY AM I ALWAYS LATE FOR THE AWESOME plus bad VIDEOS?!!!!
This is making $$$$$$ to anyone who reporting
Jesus christ can you just lay off of him for a minute. You 3 and 4 letter networks telling parents that he is a somehow bad influence. Sure he shouldnt have posted the video and sure he didnt do the right thing, but he came out and made a public apology to his viewers, the victims family, and the internet as a whole. He has also done SO much for people in need and has become thousands of kids idol. Nobodies perfect, nobody will ever be perfect. People make mistakes and you big media people need to realize that and not tell parents he is a terrible influence.
idk i live in sweden
You gize are f::k
Guys i dont understood what's going on ???
He didnt get fired get your facts straight
Heh I didnt read it roght
This is so stupid, people signing a petition to remove Logan Paul's channel from YouTube and getting mad at him for this. A Game of Thrones star calls him an idiot. Game of Thrones has much worse scenes than a dead body hanging. The question people should be asking is why does Japan have a serious suicide problem?
Logan said sorry this is really hard for Logan
The dumbest most offensive part of this incident is that he said he was only "raising awareness" about suicide. That is the most insincere part of his apology video. What a moron.
Someone could off made him laugh and I am a teen not an adult
How do you guys know he was laughing at the dead body
It was at this moment that he new
He ***k up
Growing up experience?! 
The dude's a grown man!!
GOOO TOOO MYYYY CHANNWELEL FOR RAWW FOOTTAGE WATCH IT BEFORE IT GETS DELETEDDDDDDDD
Heres the thing about this dumbass. He said it was to spread the word about suicide and try to stop it or something but that was probably a fucking coverup to make himself look better. It didnt work anyways smh
40: made him sound like a pedo 
If they say he's a bad guy there wrong. He made a very bad mistake, so try to back off and give the guy space.
He is a stupid idiot.
Who tf likes him 
petition for Logans Youtube Red series to be cancelled. Just like they did PewDiePie.
Did he actually show the dead body in the original video??
Chiara Yes
"I didnt do it for views. I get views?" THE FUCK ?? then whats with the clickbait?  u should know that thing you've done is just disgusting.. your old and mature enough and should know what's right or wrong
i lost my childhood friend only four months ago to suicide. The pain such a loss causes is beyond words. If LP had even a minor inkling of what this feels like, he would be less apt to treat this subject like an episode of Jackass.He needs to learn this lesson the hard way and understand what content should be treated with the utmost respect. He has an awful lot of power and millions of impressionable young subs.
Celie Was Here Aw I feel you and you are right <3
He really fucked up
Followers or subscribers yep she said FOLLOWERS
Oh o...
bruh.
Logan Paul did not mean to do it and he deleted the video and apologized for doing it and he is a grate person for saying sorry to everyone even the person family to and he did not mean to post the video so stop being mean to he he did good by deleting the video and saying sorry for what he did and like he said he blamed himself for doing it so stop saying mean things to him please.......... .
Rose Moon I do know what that means but thank you
pretz the one thank you for the great letter
How is it not his fault? Sure the reason for the person hanging themselves isn't. Going into "Suicide Forest" and filming dont you think he would have thought, "YO THIS IS SUIDICE FOREST THERES PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO KILLED THEMSELVES HERE." Yes he did think that. Wanna know what he did with that thought? He recorded, edited, AND posted the video with the dead guy in the thumbnail. None the less he made jokes about the dead guy. His so called "Apology" was as staged as a clown video. He was reading something off-screen. How is he depressed about it if he's using it for views? How is this not his fault for posting it? I'm sorry kids but later in life you will learn something called common sense.
Madison Zeneberg He's not really sorry kid. He just made the sorry video to use as a excuse of why he's still a good person. He recorded a dead person, made jokes, then posted it on youtube, you can't do this on accident. I hope someday kids like you will grow up and realize that he deserves the hate.
FUCK LOGAN
You cant have followers on YouTube
STOP BEING SO SOFT
Logan Paul took the first L in 2018
"I don't do this for views, I get views." LOL SUREEEE guys, he just does it for views to get money.
This video got on the news???
Damn he's that famous
when I first saw Logans video I honestly thought that it was fake because a lot of youtubers use clickbait. I think that this is very disrespectful of Logan in my opinion . I enjoy Logans videos but as an adult he should know when is too far and he should be mature enough to know where exactly his limits should go for respect to himself and other people.
That is not the tittleand be nice
Save the logang
He doesnt mean it atleast.  He say sorry.
I wish people would forget about this clown  the dudes trash  disrespectful and ultimately a nobody in the world  wed be better off without his trashy YouTube content
The Paul brothers have been cancelled. May I suggest some gentle Bob Ross or perhaps more exciting Gordan Ramsey? Theyre more human than these fuckers
'Top Entertainer In The World'. 
My ass.
This is just dumb. How can you raise suicide awareness by displaying someone else's misfortune? He is just immature and full of shit. I feel bad for the family of the dead person. This is a big deal and we get to pay for making stupid mistakes. Sometimes we think that we are invincible because of our status, but we do still human and we are so vulnerable to being stupid. Now it is your turn Logan shithead.
They need to get it right IT IS CALLED SUBSCRIBERS
pls Logan come vlog again that was 1 mistake only 1 and you may lose some peps but i know you have me. Like if you agree
This is shit
he intended to show suicide awareness, 
when he goes in a forest where people end their lives, 
wearing a fucking toy story hat,
and laughing and smiling with his friends about it.
how do people like him and his brother??
ppl seriously need to stop he didnt do it to make fun of suicide
Never heard on em'
He should lose his fame tbh
Let's be honest here. I hate to use the "R" word, but there was clearly racism involved in his behavior. He doesn't see the Japanese people as human beings, he sees them as nothing more than caricatures. May I suggest these videos to see the Japanese perspective of his gross behavior: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNlOVdTQEIMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuJ09HN4JO4It's sad that so many PARENTS allow this stupid person to be a role model for their children. YouTube should terminate his channel.
For everyone that is in the Logan or Logan Pauler DONT I am not say that because I am a jake Pauler I am saying that because its wrong to make fun of suicide and its not okay bc some people are suffering with that .
Watch JOEY he went to that place bit never film a dead body be like JOEY LOGAN
ABC news just fuck of you make bias news you Hillary supporters trash I hope these bias news channel's just get closed down
omg yes the media might actually ruin him.. or he will just get more popular.. ffs
This is why white people fucked up really bad
This is how some atheist lost morality like this putrid stench of Herrogido
With reading the title of his vlog I couldnt watch the vlog because I felt that by me even watching that was disrespectful
yea e' gong o ell..
I still love Logan
Thebffslimers M&m&n you're and idiot
HA YOUTUBE GOT BACKLASH
My favorite news outlet
"Hate watch him"  What a moronic concept that is.  Millennials..........
VixxenEyez lol yeah I noticed that too, and I was going to post another comment pointing it out, but I thought it was best to just let it go.
Its not a Millennial issue, its just a Logan Paul issue. He doesn't represent Millennial, he only represent himself.
Excuse me not all millennials are as brainless, stupid and as ignorant as this walking booger with a 2009 Justin Bieber haircut!
I am a Logangster and you don't talk shit about him opposable thumbnail
opposable thumbnail and to think she actually "edited" that comment lmao, i don't know if it's more sad or hilarious.
0:15 trust me, they all know.
Post Scriptum, why is the news reporting on stupid youtubers now?
Wtf is wrong with you people. He made 1 stupid mistake and the whole world want him to die. Sure I agree what he did was very wrong and he did it with out thinking but for goodness sake we are all human beans we all make mistakes. People are so quick to jump into criticizeing him just because he did something wrong for the first time. Like for goodness sake you want him to kill his self before you guys forgive him?Look at your self before u judge someone else.
its because of people like him the new generation gets fucked
This guy just killed his career big time now its all over its not fun to u anymore
I never watched him or his dumbass brother. #TheFallOfThePauls
Bobthekillerfrog Looks like we caught one boys! Throw 'em in the pile with the other brain washed 12 year olds. He has severe "Logang" within his bloodstream.
I'm in the logang you should try watch it's pretty fun at least try you don't have to watch his brother
KaylaTalksAwesome - I think you need new friends.
eVo Feedz if I could like more than once, I would.
He's on ABC wow
What about all the YouTubers that attacked him too? No? Only Aaron Paul and Sophie Turner? We only need the celebrities words, not the YouTubers or their audience. I can tell you're setting this up for another Adpocalypse.
You disgust me nearly as much as Logan.
You sir were not raising awareness. Anything to make yourself look better.  When he saw the body he genuinely laughed . Suicide is real and is nothing to joke about. My son subscribe to his channel I will be removing that! Bye Felicia!
Correction "SUBSCRIBERS" Not followers
Sorry keep going
Someone shoot this annoying twat.
@everyone To be honest we as humans need to be more responsible in our lives. We need to be there for the people around us and help in any situation possible. The human race and this planet depend on us. If we continue to let this kind of stuff consume our media and our youth then what kind of future are we going to have for ourselves?Will it be good?Well no,so we should make a change for this bullshit happening , as role models and HUMANS we should do BETTER things! (I have wrote this around the actual bullshit happening in social media right now)
I was in Tokyo for 10 days during Christmas week 
He is a scum bag he is not sorry at all
You mean subscribers?
The dead guy was like to his family just going to "hang out".
Random Alien wtf is wrong with you
I think what's even worse is the masses of kids who are supporting him in all this. These kids could grow up thinking this kind of stuff is okay. Kids are the future as they say so this is quite alarming
I don't see whats the problem he said sorry now you just wanna put it everywhere!!! its not even serious!!!
Crazy bastard n his fellowship
abc is the worst for stuped drama
He just is a money blinded guy who doesn't know who he is hurting
Its kinda disgusting that Logan thought by showing the body it would be raising awareness, thats like him raising rape awareness by filming someone getting raped, or raising drunk driving awareness by filming someone actually getting killed by a drunk driver. It wasnt a smart move
we're can I find this video? I'd love to see it so I can give it a thums up.
we're can I find this video? I'd love to see it so I can give it a thins up.
Blame the parents who let their kids watch this goof.  He's not sorry the only reason he's sorry is because of the outcry if not he would be sleeping like a baby.
Annie Leblanc Oh piss off.
Haley Ritchie ikr
Cody Evans your the worst Logan did aistake Wich was huge but he didn't mean to wtf stop hating it's like u never make mistakes ur not perfect wtf who u think u r
Cody Evans truth. Which is just criminal. He would be sleeping like a baby making money off of this if it hadn't blown up in his face
jae msp Here we find a wild 'logangster'. We can see this is a common type of logangster as they are responding in all caps and are acting aggressive to others because someone else has an opinion that they are not going to put up with. -Sarcasm Activate- Because why should others have an opinion?  (Australian accent)

FORGET ADOUT IT AND UGHHHHHHHH
i truly hate all of Logans friends that were there when that  incident was happening, if they were true friendseven if they weren't someone should've just take the camera and hid it or just throw that thing. not freaking encourage to help Logan to take good shot of that man. when logan pointed out what was happening i felt chills running through my skin
He has 15 million followers on youtube
Annnnnnnd who cares........
HEY THERES WAY WORSSE THINGS IN THE WORLD THAN THIS PEOPLE. SO JUST STOP PLEASE.
*followers*
Well I was a huge fan and but this is just wrong, and went too far
Why logan
fuck off "this is a growing up experience". The dude is an adult. If you dont know that using a real dead body as a prop to make jokes is a horrendous thing to do then its too late for you. Unfortunately you just know that this only gives him the publicity he craves. He probably had the apology video ready in advance knowing what a shit storm this was gonna create.
Logan Paul does not deserve to be deleted from yt. 
when the Pauls talks all i can hear is
"blahbluhblahbluhblah bbb blah hahaha blahblahblahbuhnahbuhbah merch blahblahblahblahbuhbuhbuhbabababaab maverick buhihibuji blahblah haha subs "
peace out.
Overkill_ Is_Here yeah overwatch.
Overkill_ Is_Here i thought Snail Lover  are talking about Charlie Brown from Peanuts/snoopy.
Snail Lover as in from the Peanuts?
Overkill_ Is_Here got it, thanks.
Overkill_ Is_Here btw you play OW?
"One of the biggest influencers on the Internet" LMAO TO WHOM?
It's disgusting that the vast majority of his colossal fanbase are either defending his actions or  greatly playing them down.
He has considerable influence and it's being used to create horrible, unempathetic people like himself.
I have no idea who this guy is. He seems to be another sellout though, like everyone who is YouTube famous. That said, it sounds like he didn't actually do anything bad or even very controversial, but, as usual, like 10 trolls made this into a huge news story to distract us from actual news stories so we have something besides donald trump to hate on for once.
LEAVE HIM ALONEEEEEE NOW
I watch logan
You guys need to shut the fuck up you were not there. News people are fucking retardeds
"Growing up experience" then I must be old cause I'm not stupid
Get the fuck out of my Country -The Anime Man.    And me
How can you spread awareness by laughing and cracking jokes
What a disrespectful dick.
oml its on the news
His channel should be removed.
- there's been other videos on YouTube showing human remains in that forest, how is this different?
This fucking epileptic douche.
Boys not follows
I know what he did was wrong but  i still i love him even tho he did dis
This happened to moe sargi and omar gosh tv they also found a dead body he wasnt the first
Okay now . People dont understand that their favorite YouTuber that arent kid friendly are about to be hit from this too ? YouTube wasnt created for little kids , and yes this is a line cross and Logan is very idiotic for this , himself should learn this as a lesson, but everyone talking about this is makin it worse , holding a flame under YouTube and now your favorite YouTuber will not be able to make any money . Js. If they arent catered to kids now what Logan did is disgusting and if YouTube can prevent THAT instead of caring if someone swears in their video then fine Im all for it . Also i want to point out that a lot of YouTubers dont really
Care , they are making profit off of all this . Js . We dont need 2000 channels delivering a personal message to Logan Paul and he isnt a despicable human , there has been much worse . He was a big child , and idiot and this should wake him up and do better and know that this isnt how life is. Sorry for a rant
Just get over it their is thousands of dead people in other video. He is just getting this much hate because he is famous. Get over it
What about all the cursing that they say, it is not good for the kids
Jake isn't so bad anymore
Guess this is one of the few times a news outlet isn't wrongfully accusing of something on the internet of being Satan.
Omg Im so annoyed he did this however no news company ever shows the good things that Logan has done !
Who says followers insted of subscribers. LOGAN PAUL IS STILL AWESOME
Fuck Logan Paul  Im Japanese
Logan Paul was acting like a tw@ that day
*SO DISRESPECTFUL*
I find it hilarious how people are taking this seriously. Obviously he shouldnt showed the body but at the start of the video he clearly sent out a warning about it and yet people are still making a big deal over it, and we just move on ffs?
If today was his first day on youtube ok but he has been doing this for way to long to not edit something like that out. We all know he did it for the views. And that fare acting come on he knew where he was and what he could see there. The people that watch him should show how they feel by not watching his videos for like a month hit him in the paycheck. We all know how it works you get paid by views and he get everyone talking.
This is definitely more controversial than pewds saying the n word with hard r.
just another youtube idiot.. guy should grow up.
If it's a gma cover story, now you fucked up
It was at this moment that he knew
*HE FUCKED UP*
luna alanis yay!
Alyssa Hernandez yes I did but he fucked up worse.
?Drowning  YES
*HE DONE GOOFED*
Dude he is fucked up.
You guys are over reacting it is apart of life and he was saying he is sorry for the loss of whoever lost this man and that he was saying that your life matters and comitting suicide just makes a bigger dent in your loved ones heart
Alyss Bradford I know right anywhere in the world you go you just dont do that its common courtesy and respect .His parents didnt do a good job with him and Jake.They are both a disgrace to the human race
AND PEGGY I like your name and profile pic
Blake Cross Vlogs bullshit sorry mean you own up to your actions instead of defending yourself.
Blake Cross Vlogs Japan has very strict policies about filming and taking photos. He could very likely be sued for that or banned from the country for showing a severe lack of respect for the people and the culture. He shouldnt have been filming in that forest in the first place. After he saw the hanging person he got closer to it instead of calling the police or turning the camera OFF. He had a lot of chances to decide not to post that. It may be different in America (I know its still wrong to film and laugh at a dead body) but in Japan, thats a really horrible thing.
AND PEGGY ikr he has a toxic fan base and he crossed a line and his apology was obviously scripted
Jeez man this is going everywhere
All u guys fucking suck
Isnt this the point of vlogging tho to show what happens in your life?Not be fake like Hollywood actors?
He made the choice of filming it, edit it, post it, create the thumbnail, write the title, even promote his fucking merchandises! He's not sorry at all, he's just covering his ass.
And yet, we all know people will forgive him after he make a video of him doing charity or some shit, fucking hell......
Anyone else triggered they said followers on YouTube?
There is no allegedly , he did show it.
I watched a movie with matthew mcconaughey about the suicide forest (drama film) and a week later I watched Shane Dawsons video about the suicide forest and now thiss
It is not his mistake he did not want to do this
I watch Logan!I looked at this bcuz my sis told me too.
I used to hear my kids mention logan paul all the time but i didnt take the time to know who he was until my 8 year old sat infront of the tv and would not let me change the news ch ...it was the 1st time i saw him so interested watching news and he was even upset they were taking forever he said .... he told me mom logan paul found a dead body...so i sat down waiting for the scoop too because i wanted to see who was this perso  that my child idolizes....singing everyday its me LP...as a parent it made me much aware of the youtubers my kids follow.  Especially after reading comments ppl made here.
Im_tanya_arceo   IG
How can this kind of action raise awareness for suicide??? This kind of mind is so, wait. Did he really use his mind before doing such thing????!!!!
Fuck you news
OMG he disgusts me!
it is not new issue for American people they used to take photos with dead bodies everywhere in this fucking world (Iraq,Afghanistan.........
He didn't do nothing wrong to me
We just so sensitive to everything
Lady: " He has 15 million followers on YouTube,"
Me: " Eh Vanoss has more,"
Logan why did you have to do this
I hate how the media wants to attack him for this video, while there are many other channels out there that have done the same thing that he has done. Why has nobody taken those videos down? Why do they have to attack HIM because hes done the same thing? I feel as if this situation is not fair, and more actions should be put against those other channels, not JUST him. I understand that he is a big YouTuber, but does this give the other channels a right to be posting the same videos? I think not.
HOLY SHIT he got cyber bullied
Heres the Deleted video of Logan Paul : https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/coed.com/2018/01/02/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-watch-full-uncut-footage/amp/
Adpocalypse!
I used to like him but now I freaking hate him
Teenagers? 
Fucking 8 year old.
He apologized and he did not know what to do so shut the fuck up ABC news
Fuck him he doesn't deserve recognition He's infamous
welp, he's canceled. NEXT.
its not apparent the sick fuck showed a dead body
I'm im logang 4life
I cant believe Logan done this
ABC news is stupid
Pause It at 1:43 and this is what he really means
I did It for the views. I dont get enough views. I did It because I knew my video would go viral. I intend to raise awareness that Im the biggest douche on the internet.
I don't think Logan knew this was gonna happen while he is doing the vlog and Logan is a good person but yet he shouldn't of posted it
Poor Logan 
stuped logan
why there are so many dislike to this video .. people really are stupid
She said "15 million followers on YouTube" lol
our views on the logan Paul situation 
https://youtu.be/ao9wH6ycjXY
This is what happens when you cover everything in your vlog
Shut the f*ck 
Lol for suicide prevention while being a jackass? F off logGONE
He's such a dick
Please please please bring him back please
BRING HIM BACK ON YOUTUBE HE DIDNT MEAN IT HE SAID SORRY BRINGGGG HIMMMM BACKKKK NOWWWWW
I watch him 24.7 and my mom don't care she says that he is stupid and that I can watch him
Suiciding is an honourable act in Japan. Logan made a huge mistake towards Japan.
So f*****g disrespectful
we all make mistakes
How can you have so many followers when you do this. Your disgusting and didn't think of all the children watching your channel. Shame on you.
it wasn't his intent to stumble upon a body in a forest where people sadly commit suicide on the daily. dude the realism of Logan running into a hanging body wasn't his idea, he went for the haunted aspect of the forest. like Jesus fucking Christ we have heroin addicted kid soldiers shooting each other down for land dog. this has happened before and it will probably happen again with some other youtubers. LIKE PEOPLE WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT he saw money when he saw that body dude. P.S he's still cunt for recording the body, my prayers go out for the family who lost the victim.
Am I the only one who wants to watch that video now.
now he crossed the line
I don't have a problem with people speaking out but I do have a problem when their opinion becomes blinded or over shadowed by hatred. My thing is if your going to address the situation, address suicide because it was a problem way before him I'm not defending his actions but I feel like some people are tweeting about Logan but not about the situation itself because even if he gets "fired", "kicked off" whatever the case may be. Suicide is still going to be an issue. So all I'm saying is if your going to speak on what happened don't do it to discredit him, speak out to make an impact.
Get exposed, piece of shit
I speak for everyone when I say, we forgive you. Forgive and forget

Welcome to 2018.
Why is this trending? Lmao
Can you leave this guy alone he has did nothing to u all yall stupid news people want is to bring him down to your level so just stfu
I have never liked Logan Paul and I never will.
F you
Yeah okay. U didn't do it for veiws yet u WENT to the SUICIDE forest FILMED the whole thing. LAUGHED when u found a DEAD body and went next to it while u made fun of it. Stfu, he's cancelled. And if he did it for suicide PREVENTION than why would he make jokes when seeing the body, what if the victim was a loganpauler yet Logan still LAUGHED. Many of his young suicidal viewers could have thought that his reaction to the suicide body just proved that people didn't care and this would prob be the reaction of THEIR dead body cause nobody cared. I'm 13, was a fan, am suicidal. He's cancelled now. WAKE UP GUYS, UR BRAINWASHED. #leaveloganpaulin2017
#logangforlife and he didnt mean to make fun of the guy he didnt know how to react.
Da low gang
What a amazing start to 2018.
Our children are going to he'll in masses of handbaskets..
But society's  "All good with it."
Are you???
This guy sold his soul for fame. I would love to throw him in a war zone and see what his reaction is. bet he won't be laughing and joking then.
everyday TV's show us dead body, but no one scream to scandal. 'cause TV seems too far from us than utube. i can't understand where's the scandal.
Apparent?Anyone can know the guy was hanging from a tree.He also posted other disrespectful videos!You guys are nit picking what happened on the issue and only talking about his endorsements and how he "feels sorry" for it?You guys make it seem like it is the first time he did this and it's clear how much you guys were careful to not get sued by that guy just like how YouTube is afraid to ban him or demonetized his other Japan videos that are as disrespectful.
We don't need idiots like Logan Paul influencing vulnerable minds. We already have enough idiots around to corrupt people. We don't need to pay or make this insensitive turd famous. Block him off, stop endorsing morons like him Pepsi. ........and others....
Thank god my brothers and sisters doesn't know him
Cauz were from Japan my dads Japanese my mums Chinese and I had a friend who did suicide 
And it's been 10 years now since she passed away.....
I honestly think for all those 4M people who tell or swear at him or make videos of how they feel, or show hate, they are idiots
That's what happens when you have fans that is 12 year old and younger Logan Paul is very childish a kid in a grown man's body..
logan MADE A BIGGGGGGGGGGGGGG mistake
But hey its called suicide forest for a reason 
I just wanna say, is anyone actually thinking of the suicide victim? He must have been going through immense pain for him to actually do that to himself. This could have been a strong message but instead its turned into a click bait title for videos like this. No one has been talking directly about suicide. Just Logan Paul.
Tickle my pickle boi
Tbh the situation only gets worse Cuz of his hat...... I mean I dont want to be mean, I hate Logan for what he did. 
But I could help but giggle the tiniest bit because of his hat. Its just to distracting, like bro. Take it off
Can we restart 2018 again?
What a badway to start 2018
I love Logan he's my fav YouTube his YouTube channel is amazing I looooooooooooooooooooooove his channel he's amazinglove logang #MAVERICK
Nicole Haerle when you grow up and turn 16 youll be like ...what the fuck was wrong with me
You all are Logan paul haters myan

Damn it.2018 have been destroy by HIM
I saw the Video
Logan paul quit yputube
logan, your an idiot lil bitch
its the
RISE OF THE PAULS!!!!!!!
So laughing at thr guy counts as spreading awareness in Logans mind.
Logan Paul didn't make any jokes, he did say 'His Hands Are Purple He must Have Does It This Morning,' and if that is a joke to some people then some people don't know what a joke is, also Logan's Laugh was his way to cope through such an awkward moment.
Crash and burn !
Before I start, I am NOT BACKING UP LOGAN OK. But no one is thinking about his other friends... they were laughing and joking so they all are to blame... am I right?!?
Can explain  me sombody why this case with Logan and death guy is so scandalous?Thanks
He laughed during the video, was so so so "surprised" that he REALLY OMG FOUND A DEAD BODY IN A FORREST CALLED FREAKING SUICIDE FORREST, edited the video,put sad music in the background and uploaded it ....just wow... how disrespectful can one be ? what an asshole he is and I'm wondering who is subscribed to him and supports this guy and his retarded brother
He made a mistake everyone does and he has learned from his mistake he has done. We should learn to forgive. #Loganpaul
Leave him alone and help the cause this is a case of bullying like grow up jesus Christ
All dislikes are from Logan Paul fans
Fucku guys who hate him and his vid. Its that guys fault for commiting suicide. What did that guy get?! Nothin. Logan paul did it for positive environment.
THAT CU*T AGAIN!!! HE IS SO DISRESPECTFUL AT JAPAN
Fuck Logan
Really guys plz support him now....
Hmmm. Im sorry but Logan or anyone didnt expect it and he went out in the forest to camp out for the vlog.
I HATE HIM NOW I DIDN'T SLEEP THAT NIGHT IM SOOOO CRYING NOW #DONTBEAMAVRICK
Haley Ritchie He put the victim IN THE FUCKING THUMBNAIL!!  Don't spout off crap about a useless warning.  Anyways, his followers act like sheep.  If you lead sheep off a cliff, they'll go, no questions asked.  Responsibility lies on the leader, not the follower, especially when you lead children and teens.
Suga Is Fabulous In Pikachu Ears common sense? HE cried because Logan Paul showed the dead body. HE CRIED. THATS NOT COMMON SENSE
+Haley Ritchie but he should have age restricted in that video warning on the video will do nothing
Kids Games - Lets Play Games then y did u  Watch it he warned you in the beginning of the video
Kids Games - Lets Play Games #Dont #Beam #Avrick?
Disgusting
Getting cursed by Jesse Pinkman, you might rot in hell for real beyoch!!
Fuck logan Paul
Oh shit that's all I got to say like if you agree
Wtf go fuck your self #logangforlife
People just talk about him cause they want likes and veiws
Haven't you ever seen a dead body
I don't watch him lol. He's a dick.
One day, all these kids who are defending Logan Paul will look back and will marvel at just how dumb they used to be
Or maybe they won't, because no one seems to be stopping these kids from watching him and no one seems to be teaching them right from wrong.
I'm more offended because she called subscribers *followers*
*ss *
Logan Paul is the Icarus of YouTube. This is what happens when social media stars think they're untouchable...
This is who represents Youtube. Are you happy?
YouTube star
Yes laughing at a dead person totally helps suicide...
HEY EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES OKAY! NOT LIKE YOU MAKE EVERYTHING AWESOME,GREAT! NEVER say that to Logan! Well he already apologies why? Why do you need to say stuff about Logan?!
His a sociolpath LOL based on his action
I mean its a forest where people kill them selfs what did they think there where going to find rainbows and unicorns
I wonder what the media is trying to distract us from by overhyping this story up
I dont have kids but if I did and they followed him I would make sure all his Merchandise was burned and they would never see a single video of him or follow him, hes only sorry because hes getting backlash he needs to stay off the internet for ever
Why is this guy popular again?
Whiterun Guard he has money
Logan paul is so going down.
I seen the video. It was REALLY disturbing!
people who are saying that oh he apologised ..he hadn't realized how grave and wrong it was at the time of posting it blah blah blah... just STOP and think for a moment. he just didn't record the whole thing on his phone and instantly posted it on YouTube. it takes a shit lot of time to record stuff and edit it. he had plenty of time to reconsider posting the video. he's an adshole and I'm not saying this because I strongly dislike him and his.brother because I know what to post on social media... he just is. It's a fact.
You spent all your time on one comment
asshole*
adshole*
im looking at his sub count aaannd  
he is so growing
ABC news go fuuuuuck your selves he had no idea he is a kid in a grown ups body
You forgot to include in your report the most significant faux pas that Logan Paul committed.   Not only did he film the dead body, he examined it, taking about the discolored purple fingers, stood close enough to touch it and also videoed himself laughing about it, hysterically at the scene.  He has much to apologize for.  It was not a mistake, it was for views and it backfired tremendously.  Poor taste doesn't even come close to what he did.
I still love Logan Paul although he made a really dumb mistake by filming that vid. I just feel like the fame went to his head and because of it has been making dumb mistakes, but when Aaron told him to go rot in hell that kinda pissed me off. Just hope Logan learns from this...
youtube Rewind 2018
Suicide bodies Everywhere
Go sub to @reubenfosterhall
Yeah he did something wrong... Thats true but he is also only a human and every human makes mistakes
At least, youtube will now take it  Seriously.
Damn I thought 2018 was Finna be Awesome this is bs
https://youtu.be/TAtCE3lbvNo
what do you mean "growing up experience"? HE'S 22! I THOUGH THAT MEANT HE WAS AN ADULT!
I dont think Logan Paul is a COMPLETE asshole necessarily, hes just really really stupid.
Abc stole logan content i wish logang manager sue this company
It wasn't an "apparent suicide". He killed himself. Not "apparently he's dead, I guess". It was disgusting and wrong to film it and he should be held accountable for his actions, as he is 22. If he's old enough to drink he should be smart enough not to film a DEAD PERSON. Not even in America. This was in a country to which he doesn't belong, and doesn't know their culture. Watching both Japan vlogs, they should ban him from the country. It's incredibly disrespectful to the family of that man to film him and my heart goes out to them during this sad time. Logan should be punished by YouTube for his actions, and not forgiven or praised for the views.
@loganpaul you suck
@loganpaul you suck
Fuck haters we love you logang #Beamaverick
#BeamMaverick
Notice how he talks about him self not saying sorry about the person he exploits I think he did this all to make him more famous not to have a awareness of suicide. I say his channel should be shut down and all his funds should be cut
Well isn't this a great start for 2018
*YOU FRICKS*
Well we can be sure 2018 will be crappy.
not if the Paul brothers go down
Reg Crux yes its is.its dog year ahhh
Reg Crux yes, one bad thing happened so the rest of the year must be crap too.
He found it on the last day of 2017 sooooo 2018 haven't been dameged
BOMB RIGHT AFTER JANUARY 1
Logan Paul just ruined the beginning of 2018
I think he's just trying to be like Pewdiepie
grow fast, great content, mess it up, go on the news, take down the video, everyone hate him for a while, stop with the fast growth
The first meme of 2018
is it sad I never knew that Loagn Paul existed until now?
Look what you did YouTube Logan Paul is the best
Crying cause its time to find a real job.
What shocks me is his and his friend's reactions. It shocks and frightens me at their lack of emotion and compassion for this poor man. He blurs the deceased's face to protect his identity sure, but what about protecting the poor man's dignity Logan Paul? Whatever the reason the deceased had to choosing to end his life, his death was not meant for you to film and carry on like an ignorant, immature, unfeeling little git. Logan Paul's channel, even social media in general is spreading this alarming change in society where we are becoming numb to one another's pain, more interested in the spectacle of the thing than the impact of what is actually happening. Furthermore Logan Paul should have never gone to Japan he was nothing but disrespectful, juvenile, and self centered from start to finish. As a Caucasian, as a Millennial, as a fellow human being I apologize to the deceased's family, Japan and the world in general. We are not all like Logan Paul and I thank God for that.
Well, I didn't get the opportunity to view his video, and therefore do not know the level of the disrespect shown.  I do know that other famous people are quick to attack someone who is very popular, for any indiscretion, however great or small it may be.  If they think there may be a chance of gaining some popularity for themselves, they jump on it like gangbusters!  So now everyone is jumping on the "get Logan Paul" bandwagon.  No, I'm not saying he didn't do something in bad taste, or didn't make a mistake in judgement...but what I am saying is... SO HAVE YOU!
It was a fake suicide and he was making fun of someone committing suicide. Disgusting! Even if it was real, the way he reacted was sickening. It's even sadder that YouTube is siding with him letting children watch the video.
I havent watched the video yet and I know its deleted and all but u can still watch it by other people, should I watch it?
YouTube terminated my fucking channel because i had copyright issues and I only had it a month but Logan Paul uploads a dead body and he still have his damn channel
Bri Anna try steemit or Dtube! :)
thelastDAN You are being racist now, so you don't have the right to complain.
The rules say 5 copyright strikes your channel is deleted read the fucking rules
YouTube privilege
Bri Anna I uploaded a fidget spinner and that got deleted and logan posted a dead body and the don't take that down!
Even on the news
And now his getting more and more attention which is more views and more money for him... wow just great!
Who's this guy?
His sponsors need to help pull out. He and his team are disgusting racists
He found it funny though and made a joke about it.
what a way to start 2018!!
u know the world is over when they start paying douchebags for stupid videos
Shiiiit ahhaha he is in abc news now logan u really fcked up ur must worst than jake paul
I guess it was a career suicide
For real though who laughs at dead people, especially those who committed suicide and records it? Not cool Logan! There are limits to what a Youtuber can record, and by recording that video is very disrespectful to the person, and their family. Some of your videos are funny, but that suicide forest video just makes you look like an a**hole who shows no sympathy for the dead!!! This coming from another person who was born around your generation in their 20s.
My family and I have known three beautiful people who lost their lives to suicide. Depression is nothing to joke about. Unfortunately this Logan Paul is young and dumb. And we all have said and done dumb things on our way to growing up but he is going to learn the hard way. He will go from being really well off financially to losing his  endorsements and well deserved we all must own up to our mistakes. And he might feel the same depression all the poor souls who lost their lives to suicide felt. But Our Lord tells us we must pray even for our enemies. So let us pray for Logan Paul and all those who have lost their lives to suicide and all those who suffer with any mental illnesses.
If u hate logan or love him, watch thishttps://youtu.be/yWFs9xKP26Y
BOOO you guys are haters you smell to
Logan Paul is the best
This is crazu
250$ car 
the only way to be rid of the poison that is the paul brothers, is to inform all of their fans of the truth of their character, and pretend these friggin goons dont even exist. a fire cannot burn without fuel
You stole Logan Pauls content, you should be ashamed.... Like if you're in the logang ! Rawr xD
He is an actor, his apology is so FAKE
I've heard about this all around the social media and I Whas actually really stocked when I heard this now I really hate logan
That is that most fake acting ever! So disrespectful!
There is nothing positive about suicide 
He needs to grow up and stop screaming
Don't know how anyone who could ever watch is annoying dumb ass
*have respect*
DAM THIS SITUATION IS VIRAL ASF
I actually watched the video and Logan was saying that people should avoid suicide because there is someone who is there for you he said something like that the only thing that is wrong in his video is that he did a close up on the dead body like really close
Why is it Suicide prevention if the person is already committed suicide 
It's so sad watching most of this generation of children actually look up to this piece of shit. Smh the world really is ending.
Common Sense i know right even if he knows its wrong he still posted his video
kpop trash And he also laughed and insulted the deceased person, and you have no right to ever film and post a video with an actual dead body, when his audience is 95% 8 year old. He's scum who will exploit the dead for views.
Uh-huh, totally nothing wrong with exploiting someone's dead body because "this has never happened to anybody on YouTube before"... Now I know why Logan Paul's audience consists of kids and teenagers... Because they'll kiss his ass and eat up everything he says/does and blindly defend him...
Still making more money then you're Auntie
how can you hate someone so nice  he said sorry
Wow so much trending vids about him
how can you
Leave logan alone damn
the video i watched was horrible no damage has be done to me but he knows its suicide forest a restricted area but he goes there to obtain views :C
His fans are only kids and dont forgive him
" i didn't do it for views, i get views" Really nigga
watch this Japanese guy talk about him you will be even more piss at Logan Paul!!
https://youtu.be/JNlOVdTQEIM
I follow a local you tuber who does makeup an reviews whose channel was suspended by YouTube because she featured a knock off product and straight up said this is a knock off.... And this guy still has a channel????  Wow way to go YouTube we can see you stand behind this dork because 15 million subscribers but you shut down a smaller channel for no good reason???
rip logan paul's career
Career  
My Name Is Lenny His fans don't fucking care that he showed a dead body
Who cares
My Name Is Lenny nope he got more subs after all this fucking shit
My Name Is Lenny His career won't end and neither should it, I am not in the Logang and I actually don't really like Logan's content, but for this to end his career would be insane, I have had close friends commit suicide, and I still don't give a fuck that he filmed a dead body, fuck these idiots that think filming a dead body is somehow evil.
He did it for views for the money. And a positive ripple on the internet? By filming and not respecting the dead person body and his friends also laughed at it.disgusting
I just dont care about what happen...
Man child? Yes absolutely. However the hive mentality of all you keyboard warriors has led this man child to more exposure than he could have hoped. What ya need to do is stop attacking the man child with double standard wishes of death upon him. Just dont watch his channel. Hes a prime example of what social media is doing to our species, especially the youth. As for his reaction? Have you ever stumbled across a dead body? I have. You dont know how to respond. He diluted reality with laughter. Something people do in a traumatic event. Because he didnt drop to his knees and cry and woe; he should be lynched? Is that normal? If police came across a dead body should they drop to their knees and cry, erect a memorial and prayer circle because that makes you feel better? No. Be adults. Dont watch his channel and keep it to your self and move on. Social media once again blows something someone stupid did way out of proportion.
0:36 subscribrs not followers
I know this is bad,but he his my favorite you tuber he also posted a so sorry video.........
stupid guys .youtube thinks its ok ?
At least the news docent try to murder Logan Paul
What that fuck is wrong the everyone, The guy said he was sorry. If you ask me he does not need to apologize to anyone for no reason, if you did not like the video that he uploaded then don't fucking watch it, there no need for your whining people. People talk about disrespect to the body, but did that dead man deserve respect. Did he respect his life, did he respect his family when he hung himself. People don't know why he committed suicide. Maby people should learn what respect means. Paul Logan's reaction in the video was normal for someone his age, now if you people can't handle that, then go watch some barney video's or don't do that because you will probably have something to complain about that video too.
Vassilis Ioannou 
No, the video is disgusting over the sheer lack of any fucking rational thought of any kind. He knew what the forest was know for and he went there anyways, he was trying to play the forest as a joke to be another 'I went to a spooky place in the world' video just for views (regardless what he 'claims' in his apology, there are better ways to bring up suicide awareness and everyone posts to YouTube to get some kind of views, it's the whole point of YouTube), and then to not turn the cameras off the minute they found the person is disrespectful to both the victim's family and the victim themselves (also nice victim blaming, real classy). And then for him to sit and edit this video and not have a single thought of the fact that maybe he shouldn't even post the fucking thing. There's making a mistake and there's being a unintelligent asshole, he is the latter. And his apology feels nothing more than crocodile tears, he should've know this whole thing was wrong before even getting anywhere near that forest, not until this backlash.
Stop making stupid ppl famous oh god. 
I hate Logan and Jake Paul god.  They aren't even entertaining
XD yeah hes not the only YouTuber that ran into a dead body. Here are the two YouTubers OmargoshTv, and Moe Sargi.
You dont get followers on youtube, mate.
I dont understand why he did wrong
give it 3 months, he'll be back
Paul's fanbase is made of retarded autistic 12 yo shit heads, that's the only explanation why that fuckface got this far ahead. He and his fanbase represents the intelligence level of the millennial generation which is cancerous, self-centered, and idiotic as fuck.
Wow, the only thing these news readers take from this is the popularity & money this jerk makes?!?!?!  Lets push aside the pain and suffering of the man who took his life and the pain of his family, yeah, we won't worry about that!
"he has 15 million FOLLOWERS  on youtube"   fuckin  idiot they are called subscribers don't listen to anything an old person says about the Internet
I guess I'm missing the point because I don't see what he did wrong.....
Gee Logan thanks for ruining 2018 before its really even started -
Ok lets get this straight depression is a very serious thing but what Im seeing in this world I havent seen anyone do anything about it !! Lets give Logan some credit for trying but also some heat for it because the body shouldnt have been online and he shouldnt have joked about it , put the cameras down and chill take a minute and breathe !! Life is short live while you can see as much as possible ! Im no expert on this shit but Ive been depressed yea if no one has then you prolly dont know what Im getting at everyone has hard times the problem with this world is no one take a minute to look at someone and say thank you or shake their hand or help them! I want to say that if anyone in this work has made an impact its Logan
its funny he gos to the suicide forrest not kill himself butto kill his career
coincidence???
They were laughing at the guys dead body, how can you sugar coat that honestly like what the fuck is wrong
Laughing is a coping mechanism so just stop and also... FACTS

why the fuck dont they just say logan paul in the title
sometimes his jokes are funny but suicide is no joke 
he is a bad example for viewers
0:57 he looks like the bad kid from the old karate kid movie
Maybe pewdiepie will love this
Not one use of the word "bitch" in Aaron Paul's statement. I am very disappointed
He already deleted the video but so many reactions
The type of people bullying him are pure trash it's part of the reason why they kill themselves it's why August Ames took her own life cuz of cyber bullying he did something he regrets and apologized
My parents seen this
Damn people, calm down, just forget about it, he didn't know that he was going  to get in this stuff, so if everyone could just calm down about this, it would be great thanks
Everyone should just forgive him its not his fault he was just being himself and he tried no one is perfect !!
Yes! The more News outlets report this the more parents will be aware of this! And may complaint to YouTube and hopefully they boycott the Paul brothers!
Hope Logan statrts vioging soon
There should be a petition for Logan paul to be banned from youtube forever.
Lacie Bailey Hope Logan's channel is banned soon.
Also he should be taken down for showing a deadman and making fun of it and uploading it on youtube
I hope u spell right
COME BACK LOGAN WE LOVE YOU
Maybe his friends said something funny that made him laugh
He did not mean to cause so much trouble with the media over this but lets just hope his apology was sincere and drop the issue
The 15M subs go down, like *DOWN*

He has too much money and time. He has nothing to think about but useless things to do.
I just believe he made a mistake because he was in heat the moment with his friends and on CAMERA
Ok i don't hate him for what he did but he made a MAJOR mistake i also don't feel like his career should end but he MUST understand why this video is so crucial towards his future because now just from this one video he has lost many fans and just think of what his parents and friends might think of him now
This really shows the real Logan Paul #actions speak louder than-words
What the f* ck this is on the news logen you B*tch your f* cked
Wtf Logan paul is idiot , I don't know why he zoom to dead body tf dude , I unsubscribe him  I'm not fan of Logan paul 
He is actually 25
Yall I thought Logans Video it was click bait, Im I the only one??
1:23  not what he said
Mmmmmmhhhmmmmmm ok.
even brennen had enough respect to not show a dead body when he went there
Even fucking Danielle has more common sense than Logan Paul.
Normally when people see a dead body, they don't start laughing at it. That's what him and his friends did. Disgusting and disrespectful. I pray the man has found peace and his family hasn't seen the video
It has happened on you tube lots of times
Logan Paul hold this 'L' for a second oh wait he already has two "L's" (L)ogan Pau(L)
suicide is no joke but u hating cause he made a mistake to u all hating we all make mistakes will u let him go with this one
So sorry logan
HumBle BrAg?
He do not know how to react to this situation.
Why should people have to feel sorry for people that kill themselves, its their own fault their dead so why cry
Hoping there is a season 5 for Black Mirror with all of this content in the media right now
Laughing at the dead raises suicidal awarbess..... tell that shit to someone who believes u
that apology was a joke too. what a total dumbass
Someone asked me if I was a Logan Pauler. I didnt know who he was, but I know now that Im definitely not.
Well who ever killed themselves in that forest for sure is burning down in hell becouse no one has any right to take away thier own life
1:36 Sophie Turner... Is that The Dragon Girl?.

IF YOUR IN THE LOGANG AND YOU HATE HIM NOW DONT HATE HIM CAUSE ALL PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES EVEN YOU AND LIFE IS NOT PERFECT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE PERFECT BE PERFECT #LOGANG4LIFE

1:05 
BOOM! RIGHT THERE! 
ENOUGH SAID!!.
(Those with a Brain will get this.) 
*Drops Phone onto Pillow.*
What we came across that day was obviously unplanned. Dude you went to the forest that is the most famous place for suicides on the entire planet. Duhfuk were you planning to find? Ghost Pokmon? Wait dont answer that.
He is only sorry because he is gonna loose money
Bro, i've been to Tokyo Japan and what i know, they are respectful to everybody, one time my sister left her phone in the bathroom and a japanese person gave it back, you could practically wear anything your comfortable with as long it's kid friendly then they're okay with it, you could literally wear a ridiculous clown suit or wear colorful stickers and clothes and they'll ask you if they could take a pic with you, and i've been told that sometimes Japanese students commit suicide for having low grades, Japanese students are also not allowed to take ANY KIND of vehicle to school they have to walk, children too, like it's seriously so safe for them to let their 4 year old child walk ALONE on the streets to school(cuz i saw one)
And the very first time they go to school as children, their first lessons are MANNERS
RANT OVER!
I have Logan Paul.
*What A Kid Thinks*
Hey Mom I heard what suicide means! Its what happens after you watch Logan Paul!
Guess where I heard it from! A guy in the comments!
he even made Japanese people uncomfortable and disrespect japan culture in his other vlog
Why is no one talking about the laughing during his video/ his reaction? He & the group should be looked into for murder.
I feel bad for Logan he is just still a guy who can't make his mind yet and now lots of people take it negative on Logan poor Logan 
Everybody makes mistakes so aint really his fault he doesnt mean to hurt people

Seems legit (not at all) When he made this video about him getting color blind glasses, he CRIED but when he finds a kid hanging he takes it as a joke?!Wtf has 2018 come to? And very one said it would be better than 2017..
I almost took my life! This is insulting!
Wow Sophie Turner called him an idiot...
Wonderful video! Continue creating worthy content and you will develop quickly! Subscribe to our channel and also we are going to subscribe to you!
What a great start to 2018 amirite. Dumb people doing dumb things all over again.
LOGAN PAUL YOU ARE A DISRESPECTFUL UGLY PIECE OF SHIT NO FUCKING BRAIN NOT EVEN FUNNY YOU ARE JUST A COMPLETE IDIOT CAN'T EVEN ENTERTAIN AND THE WAY YOU ACTED AT SUICIDE FOREST I JUST COULD NOT HELP MYSELF FROM SEEING SOMETHING RACIST ABOUT YOU THERE! YOU ARE FINISHED NOW AND SO LET'S HOPE GOD WILL FORGIVE YOU!
When she said followers I got triggered
When she said Show I got triggered
Man Logan fucked up he career
+Jason Bjorksson Is it necessary to fix that one small mistake? Really? Aren't you ashamed?
roberto martinez yeah but I think he will be fine
they act like he killed the person! besides it's a suicide Forrest! they should off know what's up! it's like going to and orgy party and not seeing people fucking and having sex! or goin to the bar and not seeing people drinking and smoking! people are just dumb as fuck!! it would been better if he would just shoot him self!! instead off all this negative feedback end of story!!.
roberto martinez up he did people hate him that's there opinion but dose it really need to be this bad?
he is definitely going to lose his sponsorships
there are people who are dying as we speak, just saying...
Yeah my ass he did it to raise awareness. What a fucking moron can't even admit he's wrong? Jackass.
Cock ducker dumb anal liberal
If anyone is hating here I will kill you Logan Paul is the best you tuber ever
Very sad these two talentless twits are the #1 influences. Now I know what's wrong with the world!
Logan is funny and happy
Fuck you
The Mans face was always blurred. His joke about what youve never seen a dead guy was pretty fucked up. But, him and his friends laughing is understandable because of the shock factor. He shouldnt have filmed any of it, and he has addressed that in his apology. I hate to use the word mistake, but I think that we all know how badly he screwed up, even himself.
Logan paul is good not bad
FOLLOWERS?!?!?!? HE  HAS 15M FOLLOWERS ITS SUBSCRIBERS IDIOT
Can all u guys just forgive Logan he's a kid he doesn't know any better and he said it himself that this never happened to him before so how would he know he would get in trouble from filming a dead body I mean it was wrong but he doesn't need all the negativity just pushed at him and I mean look at the bright side he was showing and telling us suicide in never the answer their are people who love u and care for u and he said and even if there's not we are always here for u the Logang is always here so just plz forgive Logan he inspires me so much he's the only reason why I go to school and if u don't wanna do it for Logan at least do it for me plz
15 million followers 
Fuck logan paul
I was one of the first 200k views #notificationsquad the video was sure to be scary for the younger kids watching
SassiZazzi and yet, you called someone else an idiot.
OH GOD A TINY MISTAKE! THE WORLD IS GOING TO FALL APART
SassiZazzi I am just coming to defend someone against an idiot.*
Clorox Beach it's disrespecting the dead, and the dead body belonged to a family. From what I heard that dead body was a father
I'm an Egg I am just coming defend someone against an idiot 
He stupid for doing that he already fucked up his 2018 
15M Followers
He had 15 million FOLLOWERS
1:48 damn bragging in your own apology letter. Fuck hes going down.
What a great start to 2018.
Well um happy new year? (GG Logan what a nice way to start your 2018)
ABC STOP DONT BE HATIN and its not follower is subscribers
Well that's a way to get on the news -
Omar gosh. Found a dead body before him
He is so douchey wtf
Fuck you news
Why tf is there even a place called Suicide Park
this video need to delete this video he was not laughing at the Dead person he was laughing about something else longan Paul is not a bad person so plase delete this video and stop makeing him fell bad plase
I wouldn't know Logan Paul if I fell over him in a bar, but I hate names like Logan Paul. It's like he's walking around backwards.  How about Paul Logan. Yep, that sounds better.
Well we all still can say one thing about this Logan and Jake are still complete shits
its what he deserves. its exactly what he deserves.
What nightmare this whole situation is
LOGAN PAUL, YOU SUCK!!!!!
Oh no retarded abc news is talking about it now
Followers are you fucking kidding me it's subfuckingscribers
chocado !  meu deus floresta dos enforcados incrivel
Oh my gosh he apologizes can you accept his apology he said he was sorry is it too much to ask to forgive him!!!!!
Pauls purpose of that video is pure bullshit
lets see the subs decrease
No more pepsi
Thank you for not bring him down any more than he is
AAAAANNNNNNDDDDDDIIIIII
Im still in the lo gang
its to much effort to click unsubscribe, plus most his fans are kids they don't care if he makes a mistake sometimes
Logan Paul is failing so subscribe to me instead! Lol I need it
THAT WAS LOGAN PAUL!
ABC sucks it was a mistake
Posting a dead guy is stupid and disrespect I hope he had to pay a fee or something because that is so disrespectful to the family and the guy who felt so alone, sad and depressed enough to take his life that shit is not to joke around with!!!
I'm an early squad from the LOGANG and i did watch the video before it got deleted..
P.S i'm 13..
To me, this is pathetic. This seems like people were waiting for him to mess up. Yeah, he did and there is no excuse for it. Now people cashing in on his mistake. Just look at the related videos, it's disgusting. People would say Logan has no respect for the recently passed away with his video, but WTF is they doing keep nagging about it? Why do people hate people who make it big on something so simple? I don't know, that's the negativity in this world. We rather tear someone down than build them up. I don't like the way this world is going, no matter what you do, someone is going to be offended. Yes, it was a mistake, but not everyone knows how to handle that kind of situation. Saying it doesn't actually mean you would do it when it actually happens. Just ask our veteran's who fought for us how easy it is to deal with. Ask officers! We need to stop acting like we don't make mistakes ourselves.
Just your typical american abroad
Notice how 99% of the people who  defends him are well under 16 years old
He did it for the views not to raise awareness,  hopefully he learns to be more responsible with his content (millions of his viewers are under the age of 15). Lastly, maybe this lesson will humble him enough to be a better person
leave Logan alone what if this was happening to you? So leave him alone everyone make mistakes
Maybe when he found that he's thinking he's definitely will got a lot of views, and he's exploit it to gain viewers. That's makes him laugh. Who's doesn't smile for money? I mean viewers..
He Didnt Start 2018 Well
2018 IS FUCKED!
He destroyed his "carear"
He fucked it all upppp!!!!
Logang dab on these haters dab dab logang forever dab dab
The Logan Paul video is disrespectful.  Logan should be ashamed.  Not only did he teach fans (children) about the fact that there places where people go to commit suicide, he taught them what suicide is.  Most children didnt even know what suicide meant until they watched this video.  These children looked up to him.  I had to sit down with my 10-year-old and explain what that meant and then my seven-year-old since he heard his sister and friends talking about it.  Not a nice conversation and thanks to Logan, this is what they learned in the New Year.  
I didnt think so highly of him in the first place with some of the immature stunts and I had to purchase the silly merchandise for my kids and their friends so that he could make money off these impressionable kids and now I have to have a conversation about Suicide.  I never knew myself what this forest was about so I learned something that I wish I didnt know.  Now, we all have learned something we can erase from our minds thanks to him.
YouTube  you ban little kids for doing silly things.  I think Logan Paul should be banned if not arrested.  Hes a grown up that has taken advantage of impressionable little kids.  We wont know the effects until later on.  
Hes not sorry.  Hes only sorry that his viewers parents and others that heard about this are outraged.  There is no remorse.  He was laughing during the video that my 10-year-old daughter and I watched together on New Years Eve while trying to bond with one another.
Your apology said this was unplanned.  Even if that was the case, why did you post this?
YouTube  you really ought to think about having parental controls and also having a team view popular youtube videos before they post them.   I would really consider making some changes.
1:34 <3
Jenna Mcguire x hahahaha saying some one that said the n word maybe black is not racist go to the dictionary
Ethan Kang.
Beast MK shut up
alpha0delta6 Oh god, thats racist
Overkill_ Is_Here he may be black yah know
I needed to watch that
Fuck I regret not watching it
Man Im a youtuber and I will never do that he should be ashamed
He's an actor, his apology is fake, he only took down the video and apologized after he lost so many subscribers.
I watched that and Im 10
Who cares
15 mullin subscribers
The kids who watch Logan and Jake Paul are pussies
Its just like what gets to me is that he went into a suicide forest and didnt even think of the possibility of seeing that and instead of preparing himself for it or thinking about it during editing the video to post it on youtube (which he had plenty of time to do) he didnt regret until he started losing subscribers and followers.
Okay, hes said sorry, u didnt have to put it on news.
LOGANNNGG
Why tf would he go in the Suicide Forest in the first place? He isn't sorry at all.. he only wants people to take his side.
But the news can show mass graves with dead bodies piled on top of each other oh yeah how do I know, I saw it on the news... WW1  & WW2 docos on a daily basis showing it and it's worse because it's murder not suicide.
It's not like he killed him , he said it was sad and wasn't joking about it , some ppl put some humor on things not 2 freak out
NBC, Today, Now ABC HE'S SCREWED
feel ad for logan paul
I'm so triggered. Who says followers. "Logan has 15 million followers on YouTube." Come one its YouTube, it says subscribers next to the number. He has 15 million subscribers on YouTube not 15 million followers on YouTube
A-A-ron Paul is not taking it from Logan Paul. 
Leave him alone have you ever made big mistakes? YESSSSSSSSSS UM SO YEAH THIS IS LOGANS BIG MISTAKE YALL TOOK IT THE WRONG WAY AND TRUE LOGANSTERS ARE GONNA STICK BY HIS SIDE!! LIKE ME!
F you
....I didn't know who he was until now....
*MMMMmmM* 
WHAT A GREAT WAY TO START 2018!
*Takes a sip of bleach*
I knew the news would get to this
Donate 1 million dollars to suicide awareness
Not only is this disrespecting suicide, it's also making YouTube seem just like a bad place. It makes people seem that YouTube is a place for bad and disgusting content.
Not only am I appalled to see such dismay, but everyone else as well.
Logan, you are foolish. We know you were *meant* to raise awareness of suicide, but instead you MOCKED it.
Why did you film it in the first place?
This dude is so damn retarded. 
"I intended to raise aware for suicide and suicide prevention"
You went to a forest and laughed at a dead body. Someone that's a man's son, someone that didn't want to be alive anymore. Then say that you wanted to prevent suicide? Imma be laughin at him when his career die
Hope he stop making YouTube videos anymore cause he is wrong for posting that shit
GO ROT IN HELL LOGAN PAUL, LAUGHING AT  SUICIDE HAH! I WANNA THROW YOU INTO A DITCH, AND PUT A SIGN NEXT TO YOUR HEAD: Please shit here, thank you
I hate logan paul
Fuck you
I loved Logan til this happens I mean he made a sorry video about this but still I'm really ashamed....
Yeaaa.... Anyone up for the new adpocolipse???
Wow everyone is talking about this video this is worst than Hollyweed
*lol*
oh so NOW he realizes what he did was wrong not when he was standing there laughing at a dead body, not when he was editing it, not until after all the people on social media called him an asshole for it. the entire time he should have realized suicide is not  joke, children watch my video's, this is disrespectful, i should not post this just to get views and don't even get me started on the fact that he said he was raising awareness for suicide. how is standing there laughing and using a dead body as a thumbnail and making a joke about it raising awareness?
Moron
People shouldnt do suicide in public anymore
*NICE VERY NICE*
just because he went there doesn't mean he is terrible. he didn't want to see the body.
Oh yah 15 million FOLLOWERS um it called subscribers you dum fucks
His apology is BS
Real Savage? Agreed lol
Sydney Islife06yeye nahhhh
i have no life and i am proud trueeeee
Madison Sobczak no thx. Im going to keep on doing what im doing cause idc about u and other haters
smlandreabean yes thank you
Never heard of this kid until 2017.
Now I hate him...
These people like Jake Paul only makes YouTube as entertainment industry and Every person who uses YouTube look bad.
So americans are into this dude and his idiot brother ... and the kardashians, the jersey shore, paris hilton, housewives .... etc, etc.  and people are supposed to be surprised that a dude like Trump is in the whitehouse, hahahahaha!  american exceptionalism indeed, .... exceptionally retarded that is hahahaha!  America is like George from "Of Mice and Men" people have to treat america kindly because they/it is retarded or else if/when angered, be fearful of retarded strength (military) ... America should get what George got in the end, it's only merciful.
I understand the laughing out of shock but he had plenty of time to decide NOT to post that, or atleast edit it out.
Regardless of where Paul's intentions were. He has to be sensitive to the fact that he's in another country. 
With different rules and contexts of which he may be violating. The right thing to do would have been to report it to authorities.  
So that it could bring closure to  the family. Not plastering it all over the goddamn internet. Japan is already well aware of it suicide problem. 
It doesn't need some stupid Gaijin pointing it out for them. There are community-based Suicide Prevention programs. 
Who use a health promotion approach to help address the needs of the population. 
It's a good first step but what Logan has done here is disgusting & he should be called out for it.
Well he wanted to be a celebrity. I bet his 15 minutes of fame is not all it cracked up to be. Lol
 As mistakes go this is gonna be hard to beat. Might remind him he's a human first. Clown second.
Stop saying "allegedly" he literally showed it
U all need to stap making videos about logan paul, 1 he is a human, 2 there are a bunch of videos on suicide, 3 if ur bothered then dont CLICK THE VIDEO, im not saying to now disrespect the man but come on really, MOVE ON
Hey, Kay Gaming, how would you feel if someone you loved committed suicide and then someone came along and filmed it for YouTube and said "Omg, this is history because this never happened to anyone on YouTube before!" ? Yeah, you wouldn't feel so good and be saying this, now would you?
**facepalm**
Kay Gaming are you serious? Do you think that poor mans family has moved on?
He's on the damn NEWS lol. Clearly you don't understand what he did wrong. It's not a matter of getting disturbed. It's a matter of human ethics. Is it really proper to post something online with a dead person as a thumbnail to show to a million of children? FOR VIEWS? Fucking disgusting that you support him.
Kay Gaming 
When you become mature, you will understand...
I would love to go there though
I think logan lost thousands of subs ._.
Logan Paul  Please DO NOT COME TO VIETNAM ... PLZ .... PLZ .... THANK YOU
Career suicide
He dint lagh at the guy
Wow Logan thanks for that we wanted a beautiful start to 2018!
We can talk about braking plates logen Paul respond to this comment saying ohhhhh yeaaaah
U people are Just big losers
he made a mistake
Damian Montoya ur a Mistake
lovely bones so does it matter
Damian Montoya and based from what I've seen on ABC (I didn't watch his vlog) he doesn't even carry his own camera like a true vlogger! He has someone else taking a video of him! I know this seems like a petty excuse to point out but c'mon, if you're vlogger then you should at least do it right (like i don't know, use your BRAIN while taking and editting a video?). He just pisses me off
lovely bones  its wrong but he made a mistake and people dont understand that
Damian Montoya a damn huge mistake in fact. I still couldn't understand why he still posted that video. Doesn't he realize that it's just... wrong?
I didnt do it for views 
*Proceededs to laugh at dead bodies*
I can tell he and his brother with his very own following are raised by lousy parents.
NOW HIS  ON ABC NEWS DAMN PARENTS AND ELDERS ARE KONWING ABOUT LOGAN AND HE GONNA HAVE A HARD LIFE
I don't like how at the end instead of focusing on "duh, what else would be in that forest, obviously you were videotaping for attention", they focus on how much he makes and how much he owns. That's not the problem here. That shouldn't of even been the focus.
I think the only way this video got 2.9 million views is because it had  longans name in it, that's why I'm here LOL.
Oh my
i love how televised news stations feel obligated to distance themselves from anything youtube related "you may not know them, but your kids do" every.time.
2018 the year where more people turn into whiny ass pussies
Seriously shut it he demonetized that video deleted it and recognized his mistake he also put a disclaimer.
So Logan is not doing YouTube ohh
Guys look what jake did its so much worse... its called I lost my virginity...
Not followers subscribers get it right
I actually wonder if he really thinks the way he does. Like is his personality on YouTube the same as his usual or how he really thinks.
Liked
2018 YouTube is gonna be interesting
OMG 2018 is already becoming a worst year adding it on my list of "Worst year ever"
0:36 ahhmmm SUBSCRIBES NOT FOLLOWERS but still what Logan did was disgusting
Well im a ..................
Get some news about the japan side too  who was the suiciide guy
Hannah Bell instead of addressing the suicide rates in the whole wolrd now media are going for this low life jerk??
Hannah Bell there is the problem then
Bro just leave logan alone he just made a mistake damn you people stupid butthole that hate him know he might not make videos anymore and it's all cause of you DUCKING HATTERS JELOUS BITCHES
Good job people fucking retards u just made made him bigger than he was beforehand
Who fucking cares
Is Logan the blonde one? Cuz the guy with the brown hair is the one who has a constant smirk on his face..
NOT a growing up experience..Don't defend his bad actions by saying that this is just a @&!ing growing up experience. 
This guy is sick in the head , comments of hate towards him will not help too ! He needs help , his behavior is definitely not right! Lack of empathy and a bit sociopath.. And making money  by being an idiot is also not a good example for the future generation. 
Stop watching people like that. Stop showing them attention and defending their actions ! Stop funding them !
His name is Jake not Paul that is his last name
The Bigger Story is why YouTube Allowed Logan Paul's Video to stay up AFTER bing reviewed and why his channel has yet to be Terminated.  REVENUE!!
is it bad I'm rage crying rn, 
I just feel horrible for the poor man.
and I hate Logan Paul
Finally.
If you watch the whole video he said a lot of stuff about not committing suiside dont juge to quickly
Fuck Logan Paul. Leave his ass in 2017. What a insensitive piece of shit
Cynshera Lindsay Kanye wesy
He is a moron.
Crazy things people do for views   He has no respect
Yeah yeah this is bull he did nothing
Some white people are just too damn delicate and sensitive
Oh yeah while laughing about the whole situation at the same time!
What an idiot
Uuuuugh this is soooo annoying that he would do this, I mean think of this happening to you going to end your own life and then have some weird dude come and video tape you for MONEY! That is messed UP and should never happen to anyone. No matter who you are you should respect and treat death with caution and respect! And this is an act of terribleness and I truly hop nothing like this EVER happens again.....
is it hate Logan paul day
growing up experience for american........five american teen agers thrown stone in interstate highway somewhere in east coast. killed a family man. this 22 years old is still growing up in american views.....simple arrogant idiot. still dont know what's good manners and right conduct.
0:52 Whatever happened to Amy Marie Gaertner?
I am a logangster
No mention of the seriousness of this topic?  Just another news story aye?  Don't bother to mention the suicide prevention hotline?  You may not have done it as badly as Logan Paul, but you are exploiting this just the same.
god i hope this dudes career gets cut short
Don't let this distract you from the fact that the SeaHawks should have ran the ball
I GET VIEWS.
Soooo this is how we start 2018. 
#LOGANG
B E G O N E  T H O T
Who wouldve thought you would find dead bodies in a place called The suicide forest
This guy
Suicide prevention is bullshit. Life shouldnt be mandatory.
 she said 15m followers its subscribers 
I hate him now he sucks
PEPOLE ITS JUST A VIDEO WATCH PEWDIEPIES VIDEO ITS A FAKE BODY  I thinck god bless who ever that was
I dont get why he got in trouble. He even apologized for showing the dead person in the video
Lying sack of shit! Never heard of this douche either so he's not that popular.
Welp, I guess that dead guy is famous now
yo Jake Paul I saw that jacket at Walmart
Its all downhill from here...
I saw that vid with my cuz and we were scared that Logan show that body and we were scared Logan don't do that again I'm not hating but I accept ur apology. Love, royal
Who cares
Subscribers or followers
Logan does NOT think at all!!
Stop hating Logan please stoppp
He's probably a pedophile
that guys face has pedophile all over it. and his apology is void because he laughed at the body in the original video
Fuck news channels just watch drama alert 
Are we sure hes still not 10???
I aint choosing sides Logan did fucked up but all off you guys YouTubers say that its bad   and that he did it for the money. Ok then what are u doing? Putting the title Logan/jake. Let it go let the por soul that all of you guys at talking about RIP for real. Yea he fucked up by uploading the video but at least he deleted it. And your guys videos of this man is still up.
Wow all it takes is 1 mistakes people love to bring others down
U realise this hate is only making it worse
just stop it internet
 and news channels
Apologies dont do anything. The damage is already done...
MEME  NEWS 
2017 was such a shitty year, good thing that its over, 2018 will be great!
Logan Paul: **literally posts a video about a dude who committed suicide and mocks it on the second day of 2018**
I think logan paul gets more view ms than you
CRPokemon Views don't matter kid, what Logan did was wrong, and he's not really sorry, your being fooled kid, grow up.
It has never ever happened before in Youtube history because no one was that STUPID enough to uploada video of a dead bodyon Youtube, until now.
CONFIRMED: Logan Paul is the stupidest human on Youtube!
Logan said that he is sorry
Yaisa Nicholas Doesn't matter, you could tell he wasn't really sorry, he just made the video so kids like you would defend him by saying he said sorry.
He only feels sorry after people went after him.
Now it's on the news holy shit
Hey fuck you abc news
he was laughing
I can use your suicide victim to boost my popularity with no handlebars
Ok what he did was f*ck up but stop like he f*ck up ya but really when you're mentally a kid you don't really know how to react to that kind of stuff yeah what he did was really really bad but come on people
*When your the only adult that watches logan paul for entertainment*
I watched the video right when it came out and I saw it
Omg yes we have heard all about this crap can we all just shut up and get over it
JEEZ ITS DELETED
Nooo Logan was really saying this because he didnt want people or kids to do this he Evan said he is here Andy and all his friends are there to bring us content so people who wants to do this wont the Logan gangsters know you are just focusing one one part what about the being when he said we might see something I dont know then said kids dont suicide it is also teaching us valuable information like telling us history and showing it why would the news do this every one is posting about it are they trying to get views it is really not that crazy I mean he deleted the video and apologize what he suppose to do I mean every one makes mistakes I mean the news you going out sad be a maverick I know he said you dont have to stick up for me but dont act like you never did something and I know other you tubers are rearming to this just for views and reposting and sharing it just chill he was saying it is crazy that he Logan Paul was able to seek something that many people didnt think was real I would have kept it up on my channel it also give a valuable lesson I mean think about the video if you didnt see the whole clog you should be doing this off a shot because u really dont know what happened first he help the person showing he cared 2 he made sure he did the adult thing call 911 to help thats how u be a vloger a savage if you dont get this or you are not in the Logang dont judge a person until u fully know them
Gurl if he really cared then he shouldn't use the body for clickbait. Heck, he shouldn't even post the video in the first place!
You should find other and better Youtubers to look up to dear. It's for your own good. :)
Damn this got on the ABC news...
*15 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE*  
Me: wait what?
Always been a stupid motherf
He needs to be banned
BRDDEEE
i never heard of the guy. being an uninfluenced outside critic, its easy to say my impression of him is a scumbag.
He took it down anyways
Colton Moser so what? That doesnt make up for his mistake.
yeezy
Gee what a great start to 2018 :(
OK WHATEVER HE DIDN'T MEAN TO FIND A BODY SO GO AWAY NEWS NOW
Quinton James NO HE DON'T you don't understand he's not posting no more at all
He deserves all the hate he is getting and more.
Stella blue Hoagland just because he says sorry doesnt mean anything, he still abused and disrespected a dead person. And the only reason he apologized was to stop people from hating on him. The death of any person should be taken seriously and respectfully and Logan did not show the respect that is expected.
Quinton James ummm if u watch the I'm sorry vid it says that he said sorry to him and his family so yea and even tho he said don't defend him I'm going to
Stella blue Hoagland but he still used a dead person (and disrespected them) for attention. He could have just not put the person I. The video but instead he chose to do so, he deserves to be hated on and have his mistake pointed out.
who knew one of the Paul brothers were going to to do something stupid that would ruined there carrier and whole Youtube community
I saw this one second ago on my tv and wow really really really
Are you serious
Logan is a really really good guy its one mistake and not a very good one but we all make mistakes thats how life is. Cry or do whatever but dont just assume things like logan is a horrible person bc he really not he is a loving caring guy really even though I havent met him I really hope to 1 day! #logang4life
Karlee Welp this wasnt a mistake, he had to record this, edit it, make a thumbnail and title, and upload it. This couldnt be a mistake, it was an attention stunt.
I tried to detail this in my video, but I think a lot of people will miss that. Paul said in his written apology that he did this for suicide awareness. American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and others have made a web site on what is alright to post to media and what will likely cause more suicide attempts. What Logan did completely goes against the site. I suggest anyone who decides to talk about suicide in media search reporting on suicide.
I HATE THIS
L Hoop why?
Bitch you drive a prius you get paid more than the Paul's and this comment secction
*DIE LOGAN PAUL, DIE!*
He said the video was graphic
Ralphie Hodder that doesnt make up for him using and disrespecting a dead person for attention.
We need Chadtronic
Only nerd kids watch Logan videos...
Oooohhh he's in trouble sorry I'm very imature
Ok it happend dont think on the past think on the Future
Fk u Logan Paul
Well He Still Has More Subs Than Your Channel Will Ever Have #LOGANG4LIFE
0:16 My Mom lets me watch this dude
Come on fam I was looking forward to 2018
*I lose hope*
EDIT: THIS IS NO JOKE THIS GOT ME CRYING WHAT IS WRONG WITH HUMANITY
hop off that nigga dick he been said sorry wtf yall niggas petty disney stars be fucking up dont say sorry make a movie then they be just wtf is this
He drive a $300,000 car!!!
Give him a break he has apologised for what he did and deleted the video so let him take time to recover from what he saw he continued to record it so he could raise the awareness and let people how he felt and what he was going through leave him a lone #logang4life #logang peace 
Ugh. I am so disgusted by Logan Paul. It disgusts me to see what this man brings to YouTube. And really?? "It makes a mark on YouTube history" I am done with Logan Paul's bullshit.
Ahh even Abc is reporting about this nonce I'm gased
WTH is dis
im mad at logan
Logan paul enters suicide forest to vlog about himself in suicide forest.
Commits youtube channel suicide.
remember one thing logan didnt kill this guy , he just came upon him , this guy just killed himself leave logan alone
waveridar007 man yeah but he still used this persons suicide for attention, which is t as bad as murder but its still scummy as hell
What a way to start off a new year.. Happy 2018.
*"Followers on YouTube"*
Um, what?
*LEAVE LOGAN PAUL ALONE HE NEVER MEANT TO HE IS A VLOGGER GOOD THING HE GOT THE COPS IT WAS BY THE PARKING LOT KIDS WOULD HAVE SEEN IT AND HE  DONE KNOW WHAT'S GONE BE IN HIM VLOGS HE LAUGHED IN SHOCK I DID WHEN I FOUND OUT SOMETHING SCARY OR BAD LEAVE THE POOR GUY ALONE JESUS*
Logan is full of 
Fuk him
Fuck the media haha
Imagine if he's black and did that. SWAT would be up his ass
15 million "followers" lmao XD
Let's not forget him and his friends laughing and joking around the dead body
I do't care i am still a logan logan for life
I hate the Pauls. Theyre so pretentious and really stupid.
I am 13 and you are just 1 so don't talk
Ryan Robinson Id rather call you stupid little child who doesnt know whats it talking about
I agreed jake Paul is better but I watch jacksepticeye
Yeah you have and I bet you regret the mistakes shite ass
Shite ass ur stupid Jake Paul is better
It's sad that a person I look up to can do this and think it's funny to find a dead persons body and makes jokes about  Cuz he committed suicide like Logan doesn't even know what that persons been through like me I cut myself because my life is hard and I know some of my close friends have suicide thoughts also.
ABC, if he's so wrong, stop reporting on the thousands killed every week by global wars. Hypocrites.
FUCK THIS NEWS HE SAID SORRY GODH STOP BEING SO EXTRA WITH DAMM
Good start to 2018
The top comment was "You always make everything a joke." Lol. If anyone's interested Diss God (TheDissRapper) is dropping a Logan Paul diss track some time this week as well. (Ft. Ricegum)
F*** ABC News and the haters Logan Paul is the best he make the best video
Ruben Reyes If thats the case... Im happy, but Im not because out there, theres actual kid thinking like this. Well at least its one person less
Your the definition of what's wrong with little kids on youtube. He recorded a dead body, made jokes and showed it on camera, then had the nerve to post it on youtube. He is a bad person for doing this. And don't say that he said sorry because you can tell he's not really sorry and just wants to try to make it appear that he's sorry. Your fucking delusional kid, grow up.
Savage _TheGawd dude you need to go and stay in school
Savage _TheGawd your right
Look I get it, you like Logan Paul, but you have to acknowledge the fact that he did something very disrespectful
Hello bartender, I would like to buy your finest *BLEACH!*
Is there actually no more important fucking news. So when news goes so low they start reporting on YouTube stars. What is life man
O my good
The fucking news?! Im fucking done
Don't hate on logan
HE SAID SORRY THAT'S ALL HE CAN DO HE CAN'T RE DO LIFE SO STOP TARGETING HIM
Why would you visit the Suicide Forest?! He knew it existed and people take their lives. Children watched it, and he said hes spreading awareness by showing a dead body on the internet.
AshedSoul /Gameplay and more True.
Once You Jimin You can't Jimout he went to suicide forest to not kill himself but his career
The news needs to shut up they act like he such a bad guy like you did something wrong but he was in shock and did the right thing by calling the police it's not his fault he bumped into that guy you are just don't understand it if you saw a dead guy you probably call the  police and video it to you don't call Logan a bad guy for something he didn't do
Logan Paul also zoomed in multiple times on the body making jokes. It does not seem as though he was trying to raise awareness. It seems the exact opposite.
i'm gonna forgive him because that's what Jesus would do
He never made jokes, he raised awareness at the end of the video. Did you watch the video???
He didn't zoom in and make jokes you're over exaggerating, but I agree what he didn't wasn't good at all.
Would you stop trying to expose him so y'all can make people go to Jake Paul nobody wants to go  to Jake Paul channel
Beckii King you are a jerk
I Think Logan Paul make a big Mistake but i Think many People dont no what to do in this situation
I bet yall, his manger wrote that for him to post.
and TFIL POSTED SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE THIS
kids and people are not forced to watch him or anything
He did not do anything wrong.
Prehistoric Tiger I see what your saying but Ive known people whove suffered with mental illness (depression) and suicide and I kind of felt upset when I found out how he disrespected that person.
The whole media is going off on him. I just feel bad for him that's probably why I'm defending him. Even what he did was kind of wrong since Im not really able to understand the impact of mental illness of suicide since I have never experienced it face to face.
Prehistoric Tiger yes he did.
Logan Savage
I don't care I love you no matter what it is my son that said this
The real reason their is such an attack on him is just because he is a white male.
Damn ABC News wants some views too
Good, I don't even care if media/content creators jump in the money train for their own benefit. All I want is to see this moron get taken down. I don't even know him till this so I ain't a hater of his before this drama. But as a famous personality with 15mil subs, tons are probably kids base on his contents. He is setting a real terrible example. The more media talking about him, the more awareness towards this guy.
Alek Zavala your write
Vikki V to be at peace is to be relaxed. You were hyped af over home dudes small comment. Theres much more savagery/primitive shit to hate on, on here. Check out boonkgang if u really want to get upset. Your comment would have been justified on just about ANY of those videos.
Aaron Mooy seems ABC cares enough about views. Since this is their channel. Otherwise, why even bother? Also, the ability to infiltrate alternative news sources.
Tyler Caldwell made me feel at peace. I wasn't trying to imply what I said was peaceful. If you don't like it that's fine I said what I originally wanted and I'm chill with it.
Logan is the best and Jake too
Im a Logang Pauler
-Its everyday bro-
Holy fuck you people over exaggerate. Shit happens ok. Just look up suicide forest on YouTube and youll find so much more then what Logan showed
It's not all his fault because the kid has his decision the kid didn't need to listen to him like for example if someone gives u a gun and tells u if u will kill your self u could say no that's the same for the kid who died he had his own decisions to not do what he did... It just makes me so angry because the kid is dumb too he could of said no 
LMAOOOOO
Its a simple mistake!
My cousin watches him and she only 7!!
Shut the f up
Lol youtube is trending this video. Jerks
well, idk if it is a "growing up" experience
Stop taking okay you dont no him
Japan should have kicked him out
Its scary to know how an idiot like him gets soooo popular amoungst the youngsters and how he just uploads absolute trash on the internet for millions to see. Goes to show how far some would go for fame.
did logan pual just commit career suicide (No pun intended) by posting the suicide video
His video was heartbreaking I feel so bad for that persons fam
he is nice
Shut the fuck up he is better than your channel
Delete the channel >:3
Why is everybody on this haters man
f you
f you f you
Wow can anyone else see that in the distance. What is that. Oh it's hypocrisy. ABC News and every other news outlet show dead bodies all the fucking time. No outrage ever then. But ah that's ok. Because privileged news and documentaries are allowed to do that because of magical reasons hell they don't even need to censor. Youtubers, especially Logan Paul (because he's easy to hate) are not allowed. But the news and bandwagon youtubers care about the family. What if the family saw the video. If he even had a family lets be honest the family wouldn't have seen the video if it was just on his channel. But they will know now, thanks to the youtubers creating pointless drama around it for views and subs. And then news outlets writing about it all over the world. Giving it full world coverage. If the guy even had family I'm sure they will just be happy that his body was found and he wasn't just skeletons so they can give him a proper funeral, Japan usually have open casket funerals before the body cremated. That would have been the end of it for the family. But no morale-fagging youtubers and media need to create a drama around it. By creating fake outrage. People using his name for views and subs just repeating each other. This drama is just complete hypocritical moral-fagging hell I bet the media is just using his name for views and to take shots at youtube again.
What he did was wrong, but I dont think his life should be ruined because of it. Hes young and dumb.
Everything youtubers do is to get views and some keep going and pushing until they push too far. Do I think LP is going to become a new person after this...um, no. As long as people continue to support him, which they will, he will continue to chug away laughing all the way to the bank.
Logan Paul is the lowest of the low. The things people do for views, likes and retweets.Youtube is just as stupid for trending the video for 24hrs.
Congrats Logan ya made it to the news
He said sorry!!! Get over it!!!
A I don't see anything wrong about  this I'm am in the Logang join the maverick movement  logan is the best
He shoud be forgiven . Saw that vid the logang needs him
I mean i get it but....so the fuck what
Pls stop hating he said sorry for it k and I still like Logan and Im still a maverick and the vid was deleted so pls stop hating 
Isn't it funny that 6 million people watched the video, , for one reason only, ,, because they wanted too,,
Hahah even the news...
15,000,000 followers.
hey it doesn't mean that someone made a mistake you should just put it on the news for views
I feel so bad for Logan cause he hasn't uploaded a vlog since the apology. 
I don't know why his fans are still supporting him, wtf is going on!? 
2018 already turned into a hell hole!!
JOSHER VLOGS lmao every part of this comment is inaccurate, he's not funny, not honest, and isn't mature at all. I feel like ur trolling but whatever
Because all them little kids wants to suck his duck
a bunch of pussies everywhere lmao y'all grow a pair and stop being so butthurt about everything
Its not his fault you should not have said that
"Raise awareness" my ass. He acted like finding that body was a highlight of his career and he was gonna make so much money. "Create Positivity"? Are you serious? Logan Paul is a delusional, immature, selfish, idiot,
Young kids look up to Logan and does this!!! What was going through his mind??
Parents be aware at what your kidsare watching
Some people laugh when they react to shock... Every time I break a bone or get hurt I instantly start to laugh even tho it hurts and I'm in a panic. I honestly don't think he was laughing at the person that committed suicide and it was his reaction to shock. He showed the world that this place has a problem with suicide . How about you all stop crying about how he reacted in shock and start looking into why theirs such a high number of suicides here that they felt the need to name it Suicide Forest.
Youtube is strict with some youtubers yet lets logan getvaway with this wth
XD fifteen million FOLLOWERS
You are idiots there is more pictures all over
Good job dumbasses.
With all the news blowing it up, you guys are what making it worse.
So what?
Bunch of hypocrites.  He made a mistake. He did not react appropriately, so what? Who knows what to do in the same situation?
That's it? THAT is your coverage?! All you did was a COMMERCIAL for the guy's YouTube Channel! Your whole editorial and news staff should be fired. THIS is why we have the government leadership we have.
That's his way of coping with the sudden shock of the dead guy 
#giveLoganabreak
Wow he made the news
The news lady  made 15 Million people sound like a lot. Pewds has almost 4 times more.
Lol this is good.
Memes that are on TV die soon.
HE MIGHT OF LAUGH BUT NOT AT THE DEAD BODY IT WAS  BECAUSE THE SITUATION WAS UNEXPECTED HE DIDN"T KNOW HE WAS ACTUALLY GONNA SEE SOMEONE  WHO COMMITED SUICIDE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SUICIDE IS NOT GOOD BUT WE ARE GONNA DIE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SOOO WTF
I am about to write a novel, so be prepared.
Logan Paul has not done anything worse the break a plate on his YouTube Channel in the many, many years that he has been an online broadcaster. He is an great influence and inspiration. He is very young and is smart, but he simply made a mistake that he handled very maturely. He immediately deleted the video as he was told, and is NOT concealing himself. If you look at videos from 2015 and 2016, he was charitable and kind, and still is now. He learned a lesson, and he wouldnt have learned it of he didnt make a mistake first. My parents dont ground me when I simply stay up 15 minutes too late. Maybe YouTube should test their video quality again. Because THEY should have a filter for DEAD BODIES!!!!!!!!! Now others are taking precautions too. I am not even a big Logangster, but I cannot imagine being one with all his merch and videos lined up and experiencing these rumors.
Pray for the Logan brothers 
oh lets talk about one person died for me lol hahah so funny. people think thats a big deal  but i still respect then lets move on to ww2 people died in the whole world 80 million people fucking died thas like half of the fucking population in 1940 cock suckers now  thats tragic
Thanks news for letting the parents know whats going on in YouTube. Parents need to stop this and stop their children from watching and giving money to the Logan and Jake Paul cult. #destroythepauls #ripyoutube
You guys are making him like a bad person he was raising awareness doesnt everyone want our world to be good and perfect? Most people do and Logan has done some stupid stuff but look at all the rest of the stuff we do,you guys like to nick pick the stuff he has done wrong not the stuff he has done right he has made us happy at least once or more times he is inspiring and helping kids who do go through stuff happy. In the video he wasnt laughing about it he was surprised about finding the guy. He even said that he deals with stuff like that with humor in his video!. Yes Logan made that mistake posting it but dont you make mistakes, were not perfect and I bet at least one of you have made mistakes that you dont even want to remember because its that bad. Im not supporting and I am supporting him at the same time because watching Logans vlogs have helped me his vlogs made me happy when Im sad and thats whats important because he probably did the same for you. It is so dumb how everyone is making a video about him doing the wrong doings but what about the right doings he has done for his channel and all the positivity and inspirational stuff he has done..
That Dick will pay there are people out there that will handle that stupid f**k.Who in their right mind would laugh at a suicide?
You're not even going to mention how YouTube took down all the videos about that video, but allowed the video he uploaded to stay up despite breaking the YouTube rules? I think that's something you'd probably should have covered as well.
Rip Logan well love you
Well at least its not click bait
im actually super happy to be able to be a part of the 6 mil to watch it, but hate myself because i clicked off of it because i thought it was clickbait :/
When even ABC covers it...
An apology should not contain "I didn't do it for views. I get views"
#leavehimin2017
He curses he's not for kids
Overpowered BADJ kids watch him anyway idkw
Fucking stupid
I'm calling it now;There's going to be a South Park episode on either Logan Paul or the entire Suicide Forest debacle.
I hope parents see who their children are watching! Many children have seen this and CANNOT unsee that. How disgusting
Im a maverick you all are just haters nobody in the logang wants you hating like Logan would say get on the train or get the heck out of the way
Why do the media get into this shit
Why is everyone freaking out about this? Even in Japan they don't respect people that commit suicide. Americans are such pansies. The video is down it's over with.
This whole story needs to be made into a new Black Mirror episode. The irony is unmistakable: Young man builds million dollar empire on nothing but social media gags, appealing to kids and teens. Begins to feel indestructible/shatterproof. Then laughs at corpse. His own groupies say nought but then the real media gets a whiff. And BAM. reality strikes. Real people, real families, real suffering. Mental health is no joke. Sponsors pull out. Viewers turn on him. Negative comments, hateful comments. Even threats. Suddenly, he is sorry. Then very sorry. But too late. His own competitors on YouTube move in for the kill. Smell Blood. The ending? Who knows. Let's not ruin it.
Wait WAIT, does that title say apparent suicide victim? NO
NO. IT WAS NOT APPARENT. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE PERSON DID SUICIDE
You guys suck Logan 4 life be a Maverick peec
OMG just give it a break like Logan didnt no wat to do I mean what if u didnt no wat to do and maybe Logan Paul didnt want to go on the news like WTF
lovely bones Well like I watch loads of other YouTubers like Lance210 and tanner fox and sometimes jake Paul and others but like maybe I can
Like the others said, there are lots of other Youtubers out there that DO good and inspire others to make the world a better place. Maybe you should take the time to explore and find the right Youtuber for you to look up to :)
Tife Sokan what ever
Absurdly Worthy yeah but I dont think he new what to do at that moment would you well yeah he could have put the cameras down
Emma Haas well yeah and I no wat he did was wrong
How do you get fired of a youtuber?????
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM FUCKING TIRED AND SICK OF,IM TIRED OF PEOPLE FUCKING TELLING THE PAUL BROTHERS TO KILL THEMSELVES NOW YOU KNOW WHATS HAPPENING I DONT SEE ANY OF THOSE COMMENTS NOW...YA KNOW WHY CAUSE THEY DONT WANNA BE THE BAD GUY CAUSE THEY SEE LOGAN GOT TARGET FOR MAKING THIS JOKE AND THEY DONT WANT TO BE TARGETED TOO!SO WHOEVER YOU ARE YOU KNOW IF YOU MADE ONE OF THOSE COMMENTS JUST KNOW YOURE A FUCKING WHIMP WHO USED LOGAN AS A SHIELD! SO BE FUCKING HAPPY!
Ahhh, the fake outrage coming from news outlets...knowing they do, say, and show much worse than anything in this kid's video. I'm not saying I think his video is okay by any stretch of the imagination, but there are plenty of videos out there where people have investigated the suicide forest for its alleged hauntings, or "news" stories with multiple homicide victims whose faces are poorly blurred out, or even FB live videos showing people get shot while they're running their mouths about trivial nonsense. Both our media outlets and a lot of youtube creators looking for a come-up are always foaming at the mouth thinking they have something shocking, tragic, and humanly deplorable to put out there in front of the masses. It's the pot calling the kettle black.
I saw the vid before Logan took it down and tbh of he didn't say .. what you never stood next to a dead guy before and them laughed I guarantee the hate wouldn't be as heated as it is.. (and before you go well stop defending this prick all I'm saying is he made it worse by his comment then he did by not filming it. He film his whole life and well sadly this is part of his life and he is just a person just like us
This is why I don't like Logan or Jake Paul. I hated them both even before this video was recorded.
Logan Paul's career as a you tuber needs to be destroyed
Every sponsor of his needs to withdraw immediately.  If you associate with this human garbage then fuck you too.

Honey when you grow up you'll learn the right from the wrong and that some people aren't worth defending for, especially about what that man did. In the future or hopefully sooner I hope you'll realize that.

Media on da bandwagon
This happend to me in a comment section
YouTube need 2 delete this  Channel like everybody else
Does anyone  know  why logan Paul isn't  posting  anymore
Watch it with the sub titles on his sorry video 
He doesn't actually care about what he did all he cares about is the money and views. Example he plugged his merch onto his apology video.
unsubscribed
to logan paul vlogs
BRUH YOUTUBE NOW HAVE FOLLOWERS WTF LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
You tube uses logan paul to promote death to our young kids. this is true! all you have to do is listen to a few of his vlogs, and logan says the word die about 5 times per video, and our subconscious registers it. if you know him, stop him from doing so!

I got to see the video when he first posted it and the guys fingers were blue and everything and it was sad
I hope YouTube bans him. Probably won't. But I hope they take some action against him
I like Logan a lot because when I watch him I believe in myself that I could do good in school and I do know I have great grades and thats thanks to Logan maverick4life
Vic G yeah right who wants support stupid Jake Paul he does the same thing he likes to do bad things and likes to do violence two ladies in women what do you think about Jake Paul Jake paulers
tsuyu asui thank you, someone is seeing my point here!
Yari Redding I don't care if I'm onesided for refusing to respect him, you're just as one sided for continuously supporting him. So don't use that as an argument.
Vic G Logan is not an odiot Jake Paul is
I know it was kind off rude of Logan laughing at the dead body but he is actually a nice person people sometimes make mistakes
Not followers subscribers!
We still love you Logan Paul 
"one of the most popular stars on youtube"
"15 million FOLLOWERS"
"He is incredibly popular right now"
I love logan
Little Panda stop.
What a peace of shit
Y'all some fucking pussys, getting all hyped up over click bait wtf is this wourld
At least hes better than jake Paul for apologizing
Hey guess what!? HE MADE A WARING AT THE START OF HIS VLOG! Can you be so stupid not to even do research? Seriously ppl dont give a rats ass! There was more than 6 million views like really, NO ONE CARES!!! And also its not all on Logan Paul, PARENTS take notice of what your children watch! He curses a lot in his vlogs but you dont seem to care! So stop hating on him!
Madison Smith yes because Logan didn't mean to...
Go to a suicide forest

Edit the video 
And post the video.
The truth is though, you are all a hysterical bunch of over-reacting, self-righteous, over-coddled, safety asphyxiated swooners
Career. over.

#RIPloganpaul channel
fuck you guys,, cant keep anything in the shadows can you?
Did she just say almost 15 followers on YouTube
a growing up experience he is 22 he is a grown man adult idiots
NERDS WORTHINGTON there are still kids even in their 60's
Technically, your brain doesn't stop growing until you're 25 years old, so Logan Paul is physically mature, but not mentally mature.
NERDS WORTHINGTON just because youre 22 doesnt mean you cant grow up as a person.
He should have used his grown mans brain to not upload that video.
NERDS WORTHINGTON sorry what?
I wish YouTube would create a terms of service agreement that creators have to follow and if they dont, they can be removed from the platform. YouTube really feels like the wild Wild West as there is almost no regulation as to what can be posted.
Uh what?? What are you talking about? More people get taken down a day for stupid shit then *insert offensive joke here*
swimgirl24 I agree and disagree, putting it that way a lot of channels will get deleted probably half of the majority of this platform, maybe a rule about suicide and death not being joked about and bodies not being shown but most of channels joke about dark shit and that would pretty much ruin youtubes reputation think of pewdiepie and other youtubers it would be only the youtubers who don't swear 
Like minecraft utubers etc, be grateful it isn't a rule.
Maybe not removed (I value free speech), but demonetized. Like for a year.
RFC17/18 champions Sooo... you think watching some ass laughing at a depressed corpse is funny..? Ok then.
dong, i know u didnt achieve anything, bu why u want to bring people down, make the fail. why u like that? u r just poor noob who didnt achieve anything in life.
Fuck you
What do you mean Apparently
YouTube seriously do something about this ffs ... Ridiculous that they ridiculed pewdiepie and do nothing against this fool
This is a lie he said hopefully this has never happened
Logannnn is theeee besttt
Delete his videooooo
omg guys dont be angry at logan paul
I just hate the news
Moist
Who else is a kid watching him?
This is for sure a reality check what a polite way of saying he got his ass rekt on the internet 
Logan is a good man stop blaming him pls
Dottler Spark uh no he isn't
https://youtu.be/eWSjh2v8nVY the real deleted video
#LetHimBe its not the end of the world
Fuck everyone I love Logan paul and I forgive him
Its everyday bro?
Why u talking about this its not his fault think people think before u speak
Who the hell is this dude idk what hes famous for
Logan made a mistake and he was sorry so leave him alone
Mr Pirosaur Watch his Japan vlogs and see if he actually care at all about respecting other cultures.
The thumbnail is done on purpose and he broke the law.
Wow #5 on trending
God damn it back with the crap with them calling subs followers. Theyre dumb asses
But people do this all the time why they targeting Logan??
THANK YOU. My thing is whether or not he posted the video like suicide was a problem before him. I feel like it's sad that now that people have actually seen the affects they want to talk about it I'm not saying what he did was right I'm just saying even if he gets "fired", "kicked off" whatever the case may be suicide is still going to be an issue.
PandaGal405 because we thought he went to kill himself but killed his career instead (jk just wanted to make a joke)
I guess you guys are right 
You have a point.
Oh gosh, I would love to say everything I could but it's a waste since you don't understand a single shit.
People have been really sensitive about everything lately, but this time is different. Recording a corpse and showing it to a such a young audience like the Logan Paul fans it's something he really needs to be punished for. (Not to mention that he also laughed at the victim's corpse, it's like he can't even take suicide seriously!)
Logan Paul better stile have his YouTube channel
Paul Logan is trash. He needs to be banned.
Friday you logang
i saw the living dead body
That apology is so half-assed. If you wanted to do a video on suicide prevention, stay inside that hotel room in Japan and speak about it while going over some facts regarding the subject. He may have never had any type of problem with suicide or knowing anyone that has had any thoughts about committing suicide. I find this to be a real low for this guy. I don't watch his videos and I don't care for the guy myself, but this is just inexcusable. 
Face it, the only reason people go to the suicide forest in Japan is for views and the hopes of finding a dead body. The only people that should be going there, are the forest patrols that attempt to prevent individuals from committing suicide. They are there to be the last line of reason towards those individuals, no matter how you look at it. Imagine if there was someone inside that forest ready to commit the act while a forest ranger is there trying to calm them and Logan and his posse come in their talking, dressed up in weird get-ups and laughing.
Walking in there with cameras or just going in there for fun is an insult to all of the people who have killed themselves in that forest. They went into that place to find peace. Not for their bodies to be filmed or desecrated.
Fuck you, Logan Paul.
Remove this scumbag's sponsors / network and youtube red show. Google / Disney made an example of Pewdiepie - put this kid on a cross.
ok ok ok so you are saying he shouldnt have posted it online but he is the one who found the dead body while he was videoing the wood. hes a famous blogger of course he will post a video for his blog. give him another chance cause everyone deserves second chance..
How is making fun of a dead person raising awareness for suicide? Its raising awareness for what an idiot he is
Geez he made one mistake its not the end of the world leave him alone he hasnt posted ever since this video and his subs are getting worried
Who cares
Wow, thats a good way to start off 2018. Negative energy
2017 : No one can surpass me for being the worst year till date
2018 feat. Logan Paul : hold my beer
Not my 2018, after i heard what he did , i didnt click on anything related to Logan Paul or his brother , (except this video bc its the news, thought something else happened) cant wait for  it to go away ,
Actually he posted it in 2017
Kyle Lu ! That is a good start
"negative energy"
When Logan laughed it made me sick to my stomach..and hes flexing on his view to the internet I get views
lovely bones umm, they did call the authorities air head... watch the video again, and you see the big fire truck come with the green body bag? and the paramedics, and the gurney..
Ash The Flash laughing at a funeral really only happens in movies so cut back on your TV watching.
Sorry for the stfu part that was my bro
U don't know about the girl but Logan had a point to laugh
lovely bones but that's you it's different people so you don't have to laugh if u don't want to but he does
He deleted bugnicne
15 m FOLLOWERS XDDDDDDD
Why is everyone being so mean about it he was trying to raise awareness for it and to be fair the face was blurred out
I didnt saw that video. Is there a way i can see?
"He didn't go to kill himself, but to kill his career."
-Penguinz0
Edit 1-A thousand likes :0
Edit 2-this reply box is a gem.
@rachael carney he didn't see a dead body, he saw fame and money bags
+rachael carney he was fucking laughing at it and using it for views. No matter how much you defend him  it'll never work he's in the wrong he's done an awful thing and I hope he looses everything disgusting piece of shit he deserves his channel removed.
shut up he saw a fucking dead body yet you r not asking him if hes ok because if i saw a dead body i would be
fucked up
+Sebastian Meza mmm periods are the best or as you might call it dots
Funny how people feel bad for him but they don't relize he dosent give a fuck about what he did he still posted it knowing theres a deceased body in the footage
Mintella im sorry but you should relize what he did was wrong someones family probably seen their family member on his video and he still uploded it acknowledging there was a deceased body in the video no one should be defending him what he did was wrong and tbh its real hard to belive hes genuinely sorry
Mintella SO EDITING A FUCKING VIDEO KNOWING THAT THERE IS A FUCKING DECEASED BODY AND UPLOADING IT IS MORE DISRESPECTFUL THAN A YT COMMENT, ARE U RETARTED? A DUDE KILLED HIM SELF AND HE WAS CRACKIN JOKES ABOUT IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE BODY U ILLITERATE FUCK , ALL HE CARES ABOUT IS VIEWS YOUR CLEARLY BLINDED TO WHATS HAPPENING. HE DOSENT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT WHAT HE DID, HE DID IT FOR VIEWS, U LITTLE ASS KIDS ARE LIKE BRAINWASHED INTO THINKING HES LIKE UR FUCKING MASTER.
Maria Martinez trust me when i say he dosent give a fuck, he was deadass crackin jokes about it like are you oblivious? He did it for views he was editing the fucking video and he still posted it knowing there was a deceased body in the footage
Aaron James he cares about views he could care less about what he did
Sorin RF exacly all he cares about is views he has no remorse for what he did is what im saying
it sickens me to see that these logang kids are all like "i forgive him" "he made a mistake" Please learn knowledge and that making fun of suicide and fucking laughing at a dead body isn't okay and filming his hands and being like his hands are purple and being like are you alive? now he thought it was a prank? really is he that dumb enough i mean like his fans a prank?? A prank i never knew a guy hanging himself and an idiot recording the guy is a prank
And this is how adults treat the situation not the baying for blood approach that these so called adults all over the internet are doing
Congratulations Logan, you played yourself
Ok ok let me get this straight he went to the suicide forest and recorded it and laugh about it what is so funny someone killing themselves let me tell u nothing it is not okay or right recording something for awarness but u laugh about it how does that have to stop people killing themeselves he is basically saying it is a game and funny to laugh at someone killing themeselves it is not that is really disrespectful to that person and to the family also the viewers he is thinking"oh i am going to record a person killing theme selves that will help people to stop"well first that is disturbing and saying u never stand by a dead guy before ewww who would ever do that oh let me guess him that is so mean to post that acting like is so okay it is so he is a bad influence to even watch and an idoit to record this it is a cruel people to think that is okay instead of record why dont u stop the video and call the police or ambulance stupidity just to "stop suicide"well he didint making the matter worser
Fuck hates
THAT IS NOT ALL HE SAID HE SAID"I hope not"
What youve never stood next to a dead body before  -Logan Paul 2018
I knew this year would start off shitty 
There are thousands of dead body videos on YouTube that show the dead body why do they choose to hate Logan because he is successful and his audience is kids but everyone makes mistakes Logan is a very loving person he helps people out. And for people that are making death threats to him dosent make you any better because you are wishing death on another human. My point is everyone makes mistakes get over it
Oh shot he went MAINSTREAM
i never heard of his goofy ass before this.
Bull shit for Suicide prevention 
he grasped on to a lame excuse that could hopefully pass as a sincere apology to dummy up people from the truth.
Equally disturbing and disgusting
are the assholes who were there with him gafawing and laughing..
Pathetic .You kids out there ..
this is the real Logan,so remember 
He's nobody's hero or person you wish to be like ...
STOP MAKING HIS FALT AND HOW DARE U GUY LOGAN PAUL I AM HIS FAN AND U GUYS ARE U NOW STOP MAKING LOGAN FALT AND IT WAS THE RIGHT THING GOD  AND LOGAN IS THE BEST YOUTUBER
Kimberly Galdmez WHAT I CANT HEAR YOU YOU'RE TO LOUD!!!!!
I'm gonna beat the shit outta this guy.
Everthing is a joke for him, so disrespecful.
Bro just stfu this isnt the end of the world you know ik its bad and all but just no
it's funny some shitty logan fans are defend him on here , too autism
RebecaV we know right
Rahul Nkrme how is it a crime? When you break crimes you go to jail but how do you go to jail if you're dead? You must be a fan of these guys.
I'm cringing at these 8 year old kids who comment shit like "Logang4Ever"
The lady was saying followers its subscribers. This really annoys me
Well thats his hobby so stop being an @$$
How he trying to spread suicide awareness by laughing about the person killing themself
"15 million followers on YouTube" I think they're called subscribers... -_-
Fifteen mill followers your mistaken subscribers
Same thing, dumbass. Hahaha
Totally the same
Logan Paul effed up big time
so what are the japanese people saying about this on their news? anyone from japan know?
Not a fan of Logan or his brother but people do make stupid decisions from time to time, it's not a hanging offense. As for all the bs about kids watching him that comes down to parenting.
rELaTAble
I dont know why people are  making a big deal out of this when in about 3 weeks noone will care anymore thats just life  this will be in the history we all make mistakes thats why we live we cant always be  happy and dont do anything wrong. Atleast he apologised even if it was bad he still  did. People please dont make drama, think about the past do people really want to talk about this bullsh#t. Cant beliave this this is only making him more famous. People are really dumb. I saw the video myself he wasnt laughting he didnt know how to react he was in shock. If you found a dead body you wouldn't  know how to react atleast he called the police. Anyway  I wont waist my time writing  something that people wont care about its your choice what you think after all  we all have  rights to speak and have our opinion. -_-
Walked In The Woods
1:21 What about TFIL?
Thanks for making the logang even better! Be a maverick
Why would you make news out of this, this is idiotic
Omg leave him alone he is trying to fix this mistake and it is going to be hard if he is is getting thrown all of this shade from every angle LOGANG4LIFE
15 million followers on YouTube... subscribers dude.
Amazing how these stupid assholes "celebrities" shoot them selves in the foot,without thinking...bring back Barney the dinosaur!
This isnt a growing up experience this is pure karma you dont go out post a hanging body and then expect people to give you positive feedback for showing someone who committed suicide and he would have never apologized if it never backfired
He made a mistake! #LoGang
You people are mean he did not know he would find this idiots
When people show you who they are, believe them.
I will. I won't bother them. They'll just get sin for writing hateful comments
Tricia P This comment is gold
umm are you supporting or hating on logan paul
Tricia P. so true
Suicide prevention? Oh thats right, laughing at a dead body helps other prevent themselves from dying...
How can he say he is doing it in a good way? Going there and dressing like that in the first place is a joke. Hope this gets hes subs down
I agree but he is such a good entertainment and his laugh and videos make people's day 
It's in a suicide forest duh your gonna se dead people
Dude Logan Paul is all over the internet over just that video it's crazy
**sips tea**
"15 million followers" these fucking adults man
*LOGAN PAUL SHOWED A DEAD BODY TO HIS YOUNG FANS!!! JUST THINK ABOUT THAT!!! IM DISGUSTED!!*
ok one mistake one mistake and the whole world goes mad ylure gonna say im crazy for this but he killed himself because he didnt believe in himself family loved him or maybe his girlfriend dumped him but seriously for fucks sake he didnt know that his family loved him or life was hard but fuck life do wat you wanna do
Love Logan paul
Why he's not uploading his new vlogs???
Is he dead??
The world is so soft now lol
Did that lady said he has 15 followers on YouTube it subscribers
Someone else has done the same.
Parents please try and monitor what your dumbass kids are watching on the internet, Logan paul is scum that produces jumpy autistic shit content along with his  brother jake paul
who will also do anything for fame and money. No doubt this incident just shows how stupid of a person he is thinking hes raising awareness on suicide, be ashamed of what your child subscribes to.
Jesus Logan Paul on the news
Lol it's kinda funny how anyone who tries to defend Logan just gets swarmed by other comments.
Fuck Logan he will not be a thing in 2018
Who cares..
And this is why I only watch pewdiepie...VERY NICE
Raise awareness
Didnt do it for views
Actin the fool 
Bad publicity is good publicity
RIP YouTube
Im Logan  Paul fan  And Im 10 Years Old
Facepalm, face palm, FACEPALM!!!
Logan was a stupid idiot for showing a dead body.
I hope everything gets strait becaise lagan os my favrote youtuber
his channel needs to be deleted. Honestly what the fuck youtube you'll let him put that video up with no punishment yet you're trying to make your brand family friendly and welcoming?
serious thumbnail
A positive ripple? Ha, no. You realize there are people who are wanting to do the same thing, to take their life away? Instead of making a video about it, and going to the suicide forest and recording a dead body. Maybe, you should make a heartfelt video kinda like you "sorry" video on telling people _WHY_ they should stay and live their life.
I didnt even see the body in the video, strange.
How can people follow this idiot. Im so glad I dont
Theres other ways to spread awareness for suicide prevention ....
It was horrible my friends and I automatically unsubscribed I didnt know why I was any way
He only wanted to say that Chinese  to go to the forest of suicide to se ho killed to man or if he killed himself and if they killed him to if theres dna to track him down and put him in jail for life and forgive Logan Paul 
David Questell it's the Japanese you moron. Learn the facts and what country he went to before spouting off dumb nonsense
fuck off everyone who hate logan
What people watch on YouTube just makes them dumber, instead of watching channels like mine that have no click bait that can make you smarter. But people like me get only 100 subs 
Not teenagers just children just get that straight bud
Dont hate him!
"15 million followers."
I get wat Logan was doing was wrong but come on forgive the guy a lot of   people done a lot of bad before and no one have talk about it like this before and I hope Logan learn from his mistake tho
PornHub is more educational than Jake and Logan Paul
0:56  "after he posted a video *allegedly* ?? showing the body of a suicide victim"
There is footage of him laughing and making jokes at a dead body.
I just love how people keep mentioning his apology video as if what he's done is worth forgiving.
I just come back to youtube and this happens
i hate whenever news anchors don't know what they are talking about
Guys i just going out that Logan might be kicked out of YouTube !!!
Dont forget the watch and Bugatti 
No one cares,plus they dont even watch Logan so make sense
GJGaming Network ???
Smh this is stupid...who gives a fuck about him and why should anyone care...people need to get off social media...I'm going outside!
Rip Logan Paul
And his career
so laughing about a dead body is his way of spreading awareness ??? his parents need to be slapped...
Logan Paul made with mistake and everybody makes mistakes these days like is 2018 people he was going to put his camera down but he didn't that doesn't mean like people just make mistakes and everybody like gets like I was a famous person and I just say I did the same thing as Logan and I put my camera down that's what he should have did but he didn't but that doesn't mean nothing he apologized and that's a good thing
Awareness my ass smh 
What a way to start 2018
Im gonna say this if parents are reading this..check what youre children are watching because they could be watching absolute dicks like this that are a really bad influence. If I see my little sister watching anything of the Paul brothers I will seriously block her from seeing his channel because its NOT suitable for children and brings them up to be ignorant assholes.
I'm sorry for you
Ok I get that what he did was disrespectful and wrong but your just as wrong for wishing death on someone two wrongs doesnt make a right you should never wish death on anybody smh yall are just as ignorant as he was for uploading that disturbing video
I'm in shock at this fucking animal cunt Logan Paul I'm haunted by this 
Logan and his brother are both douchbags.. cant stand them
No warnings WORRIED for my brother
AND SOPHIE YOUR NEVER EVEN EXPIERICE NOTHING LIKE THE MAN SO WHY YOU SAID THAT
Login
Haters
Call for his sponsors to leave him high and dry. How you spread suicide awareness?! Say "hey, we are gonna laugh at your dead body and put it on YouTube if you do" great way to do it, disrespect someone who was so tortured they result to that
Fr yall are showing it now and he deleted it my god 
Youtubers should be banned permanently.
Fuck tv
AARON PAUL RLLY IF YOU DONT LIKE IT LEAVE THE LOGANG WATCH DIRTY JAKE AND YOU SOPHIE DONT WATCH HIM DONT BOTHER HIM
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing here,but like whatever.Look HE APOLOGIZED,HE DELETED THE VIDEO...
edit:I'm not a hardcore "logang 4 life" but I think that they shouldn't be so mean and harsh to him,he spotted his mistakes and he faced the consequences...
Logan Fucking idiot
you girl dont tell me what to do you go tell your child that no i love him even if he does that
At this point
Fuck Logan Fuck ABC quit trying to fuck over youtube you dont know shit about our platform
Maybe this asshat with 2 first names can do a collab with the Kartrashians and see how much they can really phuck up the world.. .
I remember when i was 10 and watching youtube, i had never even subbed to anyone, never even knew that you could. I would literally just come home from school and watch whatever i stubble across. I didn't even really know what a youtube channel was. Now you got these retarted kids trying everything to be like the pauls.
omg what an asshole
Apparent suicide victim
I hope he dies
Ban him from YouTube, ban him from Japan, ban him from America and ban him from children. This kid's behavior and attitude is cancer to the 12 year olds who are influenced and admire him
We lost Logan (Wolverine) in 2017...
Only to get this piece of shit Logan back in 2018.
My dad and mom solution this on news
They won't touch him. He is....privileged
Logan should be fined and banned from YouTube.
He said he didn't do it for views yet vlogers always try and find away to get more views
Seriously... this got on fucking news?!? Seriously.... wtf...
That person doesn't deserve to be videoed and laughed at! I don't care what he thought he was doing, that was some bs!
Sign the Petition to Get Logan Paul Off Youtube
https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-ban-logan-paul-from-youtube?recruiter=846421704&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition
Look at the name of the forest stupid people. What do you expect to see in The Suicide Forrest?
ABC is viewed by kids like me too xd
Logan is a good guy
Dear ABC news, Logan Paul used to have 17mil now has 15mil smh also great quality video
Why do the anchors sound like they admire him? Hes hugely popular...gets millions in endorsements...drives a blah blah blah car. Priorities folks.
For his subscribers, would you forgive him if it was your dead body? It's like he's still ten years old.
Omg logan is on ABC NEWS 
Forgive logan
He had all the time in the world about thinking to post that video. Common sense to not post a dead guys corpse on YouTube even if there are children watching.
Trying to prevent suicide? Logan laughed and made fun of the dead body...
OMG ITS ON THE NEWS TOO OMGGG
First of all , the name suicide forest is bad enough, then finding a body,just stop shooting,
Dumbass
Really if think about yea he was dome to post it be he deleted so why do people keep poping it up like if you agree
Auto correct
Omg On abc!!!?!!???
I jus seen him on top chef too. Wat an idiot!
https://youtu.be/Ot28hhOaX2Q https://youtu.be/Ot28hhOaX2Q https://youtu.be/Ot28hhOaX2Q https://youtu.be/Ot28hhOaX2Q https://youtu.be/Ot28hhOaX2Q https://youtu.be/Ot28hhOaX2Q *WATCH HIS FULL DELETED VIDEO*
Ohhhh I get it...  u just want to get more subs and followers!!! IT IS NOT RIGHT TO PUT THAT VIDEO ON THE INTERNET! IT DISGUSTS ME!!! SOMEONE HAD LOST A FAMILY MEMBER!!  So u share that information with the whole universe and you go check it out!! IDIOTS JUST IDIOTS
He and His brother Shoul've died with Vine 
Fuck originality
oh Logan i'm so sad bc i honestly love him bc he's so generous and kind and bc of one mistake he's getting so much hate after all his hard work just one mistake has really impacted everyone
U r soo supid
Well maybe stop fucking making video about the situation and let the family of this victim move on.. For fucksakes everybody is disgusted in what he did( apart from his idiot fandom) but imagine seeing this fucking situation every where, every fucking youtubers keep "reuploading" their opinion with either clips of the video of describing verbally what whatever this relevant youtuber did to a corps... Videos like this is just turning the knife in the wound of mourning families of suicidw victims. Fuck all of these video and I report these video and I vomit everytime I hear either of the Paul brothers... OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE FAMILIES, STOP THIS STUPID TREND. For the first time I am glad youtube is going strong with taking videos down. (You'll see this comment on a lot of similar video)
Anyone who fucks up, should be dragged naked through the streets, and tortured to death...
Seems to be what the self-righteous internet demands 
He apologized because he DOESNT GET PAID NOW!
Shut up all ready
TFIL went into the suicide forest and found a dead body, not hating on them or anything but lets just take a minute and think, Logan needs to stop getting hate, when they TFIL or Elton Castee or whoever was filming showed a dead body, yes they blurred it out better, but they didnt get hate for it, everyone makes mistakes EVERYONE and if you can say that you have NEVER made a mistakes then you are fucking lying, because it is a part of life,  now he is apologizing and apologizing so much, because those of you who were logangansters before all of this and now you are the one giving him hate, you should be ashamed of yourself, because you dont turn your back on family, yeah, he may get paid for making videos everyday, but he makes them everyday to make us happy, you guys see him on camera not off of camera, so everyone needs to grow up and respect the fact that mistakes is a party of this world...
Im making a rant to Logan paul subscribe on my channel too see it
I was an honest mistake he has said he was sorry its no reason to come at him like this hes not like this  hes a role model so you ppl can reply to this and hate to me I rlly do not care  point blank period 
I watched this at school and Im happy I did because the mainstream news is watched by adults and will stop their kids from watching Logan paul and jake Paul
*He has over 15 million followers on Youtube...*
Biggest fail in 2018 already.
...and of course the white reporters were trying to downplay the situation.."oh my kids watch him..he's very popular right now" like what??? It's like they're dead inside and can't comprehend the point of the story (let's stand up for the white trash)..only the black reporters got the impact(jist) of what this idiot did!
His channel isnt getting removed because Logan makes a lot of money for YouTube sense they take 40% of your income.
Logen purl
I also want the video from stand by me removed https://youtu.be/ecsPydUbYGM because they show a dead body also.
That's why I can't stand white mofos..why is he getting so much attention??? Why companies go after him and pay so much money?? Just because he's white!!! I've seen his work he's garbage!!! But he appeals to white stupid teenagers so I'm not surprised....I guess.
This forest is very famous for commiting suicide in Japan.If you knew it, you would never approach this forest to say nothing of taking a video.by Japanese man.
Ok pauls need to leave youtube
SHUT THE FUCK UP IS A FUCKING VIDEO PLZ FUCKING GOD
Fuck you goerge
all youtubers are big kids
Charge him and donate to Charities.
Its called subscribers
The reason why people hate americans.
Fuckkkkkk offf. I am not a Logan Paul fan so do NOT assume that. But lets talk for real here, the thing he did is not a big deal he was just trying to raise awareness for suicide. The reason why he laughed afterwards is to keep a positive vibe for his vlogs he always does that. Dont u see it. Grow up PUSSIES!!!!
Apparent? Whats the apparent for? Its there, clear as day.
Logang for life
Logic  agree. I am not 100percent support him, but sometime what we thought to be ok is not always what other would think and who could have known that. Even though, he already deleted the video. This will become one of the internet history.
Lebreau 
Mistakes have consequences.
The hate he is receiving is a part of his consequence.
The Pinomic But this was in Japan an entire different society and his apology video confirms that what he did was not fake.
Nah, this is some Arab kid who's like 6 and thinks he's funny, but actually has no idea what is going on with the incident.
ADNAN AHBAB RAFIN cool joke jameskii my homei
The lady on the far right of the hosts states how his income and what he drives makes him amazing...
Hes a human and makes mistakes like the rest of us! Cut him some slack, he owned up to his mistake! Jeez why hate??
This is not the worst thing your kids have seen
Logan Paul is just a brainwashing, careless piece of garbage. Why even make videos of him? That peasant is not worth anyone's time!
Sut up
I love Logan. Logan4life
MIGHTY SAM 
Oh no.. Sweetie, Are you fucking retarded?
MIGHTY SAM idiot
Nice joke
Emma Haas they do. All they do is defend Logan and clearly blinded by what the dumbest thing he has done.
tsuyu asui You are right because there were thousands of likes on that video. And his others videos of Japan are very disrespectful to Japanese people. By the way, I think the first comment is a click bait.
Hopefully we find  Logan Paul  hanging from a tree and every one starts recording it and mocking him
Kids do not watch logan paul
I'm guessing it wasn't d-monitized right away
Whqt did he do...can you give me deeper information?
What happened
I have no hate for this situation. It was not his intention to begin all the drama but he shouldnt have put that as the name of the video.
Good now hes down
Well of course the media isn't gonna say other things Logan said only gonna make him look even more worse and add fuel to the situation
This is just like what happened to jake Paul with someone bullying meghan it is STUPID in the video he said that he wasnt laughing for the dead body he was SCARED people react like its the end of the world  Im sure this will over in a week because he isnt an idiot he isnt crazy guys he was just scared and if you were in this situation Im sure you would feel the same way I would be scared So scared I would probably laugh guys this isnt to make you mad just stop he apologized just get over it
Fuck you gusys
*Logan suicide: ****https://youtu.be/AmqB1uFGlpo*
Hello new year good by Logans career 
He needs to be shut down and boycott! The media and everyone talking about him are pumping him up.
Japan people like to suicide when they don't know what to do with their life
LOGAN PAUL DOESNT DO VLOGS ANYMORE???
Jake pauler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can we leave Logan alone he apologised already
gen-z youtube e-celebs were a mistake
Too far Logan it's time to go
>Here's a dead body of a dude who just killed itself... so randummm! xDDD
>Like & subscribe if u feel sad about it LoGang!!! xD
Do Americans have souls?
Fuck of logan
Logan is getting more publicity
Kids be like:
he blurred it
he made a disclaimer
he apologized
that doesnt change anything at all because
HE STILL SHOWED A DEAD BODY
If he was a black guy or a woman or an illegal mexican no one would be criticizing him. They would be calling him the victim.
Its a forest devoted to suicide...talk about that people. Once again, the decrease in sucide as not been affected by this but the fact that people miss the point and are attacking this guy is no suprise. Yes, he posted a personal moment of that victims familys ordeal of grief. But where was the world when they made it okay to have such a place as sucide forest; which I did not know excited for young and impresionable minds to travel to and personally kill them selfs. Once again, Im disappointed with what the world is and I am still living.
Hey drives a car and makes millions? Wtf he showed a person who commited suicide... without family's or police/legally letting him do that should be a crime to do that shit.
Holy crao no way never known before
Logan Paul has to be doing cocaine.
Vamos
The dead body aside, don't let your kids watch Logan Paul or Jake Paul: they are absolute garbage regardless.
@Rezo regardless of the typo mistake u get the point .. and if u dont u r the tard, so if have an opinion say it dont attack me for saying mine
i couldn't see what's so wrong with his vid this is too overrated
I FUCKING LOVE LOGAN!!!!
logan pual
ABC news really are stupid. Growing up experience? He laughed at someone who committed suicide. Also, allegedly wtf he literally showed the body wtf does she mean allegedly? It was a disrespectful video and a cunty thing to do on Logans behalf.
"Allegedly". There is video proof of it. This isn't trumps twitter account the internet can back this up
Kids should be watching me instead of his trash lmfao
???????
0:34 followers...
Alledegy? No he DID show a dead body.
What an excuse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdRtkv-NBpY&t=3157s you can see perfectly a couple that killed themselves if you pauze at right time...but i was not logan paul so...
They newsed his ass
He says he copes with things with humor. Maybe he was in shock and did it without thinking? Idk man either way it's sad
pls some one kill him ???
Lyms 
Some armys are stupid asf and im an army
louis fontenot sr 
I really do not mean that but I was angry at that moment
Carl Me 
At least our fandom are respectful towards humanity and are not supportive of a trivial man like Logan Paul
Don't you learn from LP's video incident? "DON'T JOKE ABOUT DEATH SO EASILY". SMH.
These guys are annoying.
Leave the kid alone. What about the people that filmed the holocaust, people that films wars and whatever. Thats right, we live in a butthurt world.
Delete this video he soo good
I'm depressed and I wanted to hang myself I also hate logan paul and I felt very offened
Hey guys I think I've got some fresh news about what Paul did. http://brisktopia.com/62oe
PLEASE DONT FIRE HIIIIIM  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq6USCBuDd0&feature=youtu.be full video of logan paul go now before get terminate
Logan is the best he just made a mistake its not like you never made one jake paul makes lots of mistakes why not ban him to see its one mistake and sure it might be a big one but come on it wasn't his fault that guy killed his self and there
Oh God it's Matty B
Nathan Vlogs yes everyone makes mistakes but logan made to many and now he passed the limit.and yeah it was his fault dont act like it isnt. so what the man killed him self that doesnt mean he deserves to be laughed at and made fun off so yes its still logan fault how about you lighten up and then comeback
Every1 hates jake paul already
It's not a mistake, he just didn't care.
Plz sub to me and your right but come on he's a dumb blond choch
He is using a dead body to promote himself and make jokes instead of just don't upload the video at all... That is not ok to use man misery this way... A normal person would just stop the making of a video and move on to something else, but logan paul sees an oportunity to make more views. And if you know a litlle about the japanese culture and the story of this very forest you would know that it's not okay to joke about it. There is many books and serious documentarys about it that explain what a serious issue it really is. Logan paul was blinded by the views factor and didn't think straight, and that's the real shame here. Think with youre head and heart not with youre wallet. 
Sorry for my bad english by the way.
Yeah provide awareness by laughing after
logan paul and his friends have been poisoning the minds of young people in every video he has ever made everyone needs to report his and his friend channel for child abuse
I understand this is your opinion but if your going to voice it please don't be one-sided look at it from all aspects because all of these topics hit home for me I've personally had experience with suicide not myself but friends and family and I know people who don't care for Logan but he's also helped some people in my life. He's shown them that it's ok to be different and be outside of the box and not have to be validated by others basically to be a "MAVERICK" I truly understand what he did was so wrong but I feel if your going to speak out about it don't be one-sided because different people have different experiences with this situation and him in general.
damn tell me the name of your pusher he sells good stuff apparently
Report this comment
Infrigement of my rights 
supersoldier 1985 uhm this comment is  relevant to the video so stop acting smart
Logan is shotdown
Stop ruining logan paul vlog, hes the best yt who cares about the suicidal video im still a maverick.
His biggest mistake was existing
Well duh tf you think youll find in a Suizide forest unicorns???
He's a narcissistic piece of shit,  along with a handful of other so- called youtube "stars".
youtube should ban him
Forgive him
Probably just did it for views. Raising awareness?  By laughing and mocking at it?
Might as well stop beating around the bush. satanists are pushing crap like this logan paul thing. They want people to stop seeing life as sacred and behave as depraved beasts. Why else would there be so much depraved media being pushed on the kids day after day. The problem is the system, not just 1 cunt on youtube
If there is no God why should life be sacred? Stop and think. If there is no God, slitting someones throat and cutting an apple would be the same because we would all be meaningless purposeless random protoplasmic blobs of atoms.
Life is only sacred because of God blessing us with it and decreeing it sacred. Stop trying to fight a spiritual battle with secular humdrum talk. It wont work
There is a God, Jesus, and there is a devil. There is spiritual good and spiritual evil. 
PICK UR SIDE
Funny
1:24  that has happend... On TFIL AKA ELTON'S channel. He and his youtube friends were also exploring the suicide Forest and in the video you can see EVEN 2 BODIES!!!!!!!!!
Money makes the stupid heartless and ruthless.
I think Logan Paul did what a lot of kids of his age would have done.  He tried to cover his shock and fear by laughing and joking about it.  He has done the correct and decent thing - he has said that he is sorry and that he made a mistake - what more can he do?!  He is very young and used bad judgement.  Life doesn't come with a manual.  We learn and grow by our mistakes.  Why are some people so harsh and unkind on the internet!
I never watch that loser anyway.

Fuck that piece of shit logan paul and his retarded 10 year old fans! *Filming a dead body, laughing, smiling and making jokes is just wrong and disrespectful. Spirits are real and I fucking hope logan paul gets haunted by the spirits for the rest of his life because lame ass YouTube isn't gonna do jack shit to him or his stupid videos. Jake Paul videos are also shitty so fuck him too.*
He apologized so stop saying bad for him...
Thats not even funny.
Thank god mainstream media is covering this
Disgusting person
logan did nothing he was only lafing because he coudent belive what he was seeing.the video has been taken down so all these news cannels can stop posting vidos about what he did.so every onr get a grip he dint do eany thing
we all love Logan. if any body in that place they would have filmed it.. so just forgive him..love u Logan.
mick95 mic woowww thank u so much.......v
Fuck you, crazy racist bitch! You should commit suicide by slashing your fucking wrist right now!
he takes the video down YOUTUBE WTF ARE YOU DOING????!!!
From the comments and debates I have seen here, there seems to be a young vs old blame game.  That is not the point here.  This should make you question yourself and what you do with social media.  
Regardless of age, people are callously attacking each other for either being or not being a Logan Paul fan or supporting/not supporting Logan Paul.  I could care less about Logan Paul.  Everyone should look at what they have been commenting, does this reflect how society should be?  Is this how we should treat each other?  Calling each other *itch, dumb?  Just because you can't see someone doesn't mean you can say this kind of stuff.  The way that people, young and old, are using social media is inquestion here.  The line between human decency and self expression, between humanity and animals.  Those are the questions we should be asking ourselves, regardless of age.  
Why is society degrading?  What can we do to make it better?  Control what you can, how you react.  Is this nasty comment really necessary?  Chose to react with integrity and kindness.  Be aware that what you do online affects the offline world.  They are not two separate worlds, like some game.  There are people behind those words, images, and videos.
I like logan paul is my best youtouber ever
OH, SO HE IS SORRY, HUH? 
This world is no place for people who have the audacity to make fun of suicide victims. 
Nobody deserves this. Everybody knows that. Where is your conscience and your brain when you are making jokes on the dead corpse, same goes for Logan Paul Logangsters who defend him and say: 'He is sorry for it'
YOU DONT SAY SORRY WHEN U DONT MEAN IT. 
It's preposterous how all he did was remove the video and post a simple apology video. I am not expecting him to organise a fund raiser for the family of suicide victims or anything. It's not very sincere just by apologizing on YouTube. It's not exactly directed to anybody. The least he could do is write a letter personally to that family, or even send a generous amount of money over. If he doesn't know the family, he could ask the foreign authorities to identify the body. 
I know I sound ridiculous, but seriously making fun of suicide corpses is not funny, and should not be defended. He did say sorry, but saying sorry does not just cover up your past mistakes. Ur actions prove you are sorry. The most sincere way and the least he could do is personally apologise to the family. 
I hope you side with me. 
Do not leave negative comments with bad grammar, because stupid people have contagious "stupidity diseases"
Save your keyboard and keep your insults to yourself
Logan's fans are so dumb they don't realise what's wrong with the fact he filmed a dead mans body. No respect at all. If that was a member of my family I'd beat that curly haired fucking idiot to within an inch of his pathetic life. For all you idiot kids defending him     I hope the same happens to you one day and you get laughed at you fucking blind bunch of sheep
FUCK LOGAN PAUL AND THE FUCKING 12 YEAR OLDS THAT FUCK WIT HIM......SIMPLE!!!!!
I CANT LEAVE THE LOGANG 
IM A 10 YR OLD KID 
I DONT CARE
I AM NOT LEAVING THE LOGANG
Don't you understand that he was trying to prevent suicide and he doesn't need all this hate in this world ,about half of this world would kill them self and he was just trying prevent others from doing so especially his logang he said sorry at least if he didn't then yeah he would deserve it so don't be go hating on someone until you think what they are trying to say and do
blue owl You really believe him and his B.S.? Than you are really a foolish one (child?).  No one in their right mind would post a vid in the suicide forrest while "laughing and giggling" at the spectacle of witnessing a dead body and then say this is for suicide prevention. Please!
If i see anyone kill her self
I will laugh for a month
I believe thats 15 million subscribers not followers
I saw that vlog
The fact that kids no older than 13 (or, at least, have the mindset of a 13 year old) are actually DEFENDING him?? Logan Paul is the saddest excuse for a human being I have ever known. He's disrespectful, and what he did was WRONG. He should have KNOWN he would find something like that in a fucking forest know for it's SUICIDES. And suicide is not a fucking joke!!! What the hell is with those people, laughing at the dead body like it didn't used to be a person, and a person that decided to take their life because they were THAT MISERABLE. He is the EMBODIMENT of DISRESPECTFUL and something like this doesn't even deserve the punishment of 'getting his channel taken down', somebody SUE HIM.
And just because he made a video apologizing for what he did, and trying to actually back out of it by saying it was to 'help spread awareness'?? Like, what in the actually hell is mentally wrong with you?? His fucking 'apology' note had an emoji in it and was mostly about him...now try telling me if he was serious or not.
I knew that this would happen.
Both the Paul brothers need to go there jus a whole mess tbh.. bet there Mom is Disappointed.. what a bad start for Logans 2018..
Aaron Paul is a hoeeeee!!
No hate 
Im just sayin
Sophie Turner is an idiot
And Aaron Paul too
He did do for views hes an ass hole
what black mirror episode is this
Stfu. Stop trying to be trendy
Wow.......I trusted you Logan........
You can't do that
Both of his apologys are bull shit
Correction - he didnt apologize. Go back and listen or read the transcript of his apology video. He never expresses remorse, only regret.
lIkE iF YoRe iN ThE LOgaN!!11!!
i have the full video on my channel
I'm 18  I'm  young and pretty sure who else watch his channel  no matter how old you nobody should never think this was a joke suicide is serious its nothing you should joke if you joke about suicide then your a disgusting human being he never should of posted that video laughing being rude even his friends were laughing why the would you go to a suicide forest to film in the first place it was supposed to be fun this was never supposed to happen what's fun about going to forest where people commit suicide I know logan Paul is young and dumb but even dump people not to record a person who just hung himself this not the first time someone did something on the internet and all of social medial got mad about probably won't be the last but everyone needs a second chance if he do something anything that i just witness or anything simliar i no all of social media wont forgive him
Logan Paul is the very racist
Guys plz help me im 11 and i dont see what logan did wrong cuz i know it wasnt okay to show it so can some specifically tell me what happened
I am sorry but somethings need to be off camera like as soon as they saw the body the camera should have been shut off and they police should have been called so they could notify the family (Don't get triggered) just saying that should have been a personal matter within the group not the whole community (once again don't get triggered)
When I first heard this I thought he was in the states but he's in suicide forest its tons of videos from suicide forest on YouTube not a big deal really
Is anyone vegan and like what about the animal holocaust, people are saying that his fans defending him are blind and brainwashed while they are eating dead bodies of innocent I repeat, innocent animals that are born into slavery, murder and rape I say everyone is brainwashed regardless
he is so stupid (he said  i intended  to raise awareness for suicide ) lol really? he even just laugh there and also he went to the private property place  not funny
He is lying you can tell his apology video was fake he was fake crying
+rainbow butterfly and you do have talent? Maybe talent at being a fucking emo
Just love it when news people talk about youtube, cause they know nothing about it. A "growing experience", no this was a royal fuck up, and he needs punishment for it.
WoW Logan you're famous
Man people make mistakes give him a break I bet a lot of you that commented on this loved his videos before this, so cut him some slack you would post this to if you guys were huge vlogers and wanted to show some crazy content to your fans so everyone needs to chill and let him figure his own shit out he doesnt need stupid comments from people like you guys
Chris Stilling why dont you chill and ur just making the situation worse by saying hes bad and feeding the fire why do you even care unless you wanna commit suicide
Alyxity yes true, but you can also barely see the dead body
Pokemon Go yes but he could have cut out the part where he saw the dead body.
Yes my mom knows yes the was dum but he did not know what to dp
Yes! atleast mainstream media caught onto this
Its not about what you wanted to happen its about what you did.
Get over it.
Thanks internet for still making him and jake relevant smhhh
I don't even like these brothers,idiots!
Fuck this Logans great your shit now fuck off
I didn't even know this guy existed. He has 15 million subscribers?!

Top 3 most hated people in the world
*1=Donald Trump*
*2=Ajit Pai*
*3=Logan Paul*
SpiceGirlReligionist 
There are some people so abhorrent that they are hated almost unanimously and they typically deserve it. 
Play stupid games,  win stupid prizes.
1=Anyone who has an opinion alternative to your's
Matthew Menotti yes he is
Kylee Hattett  that's because you are either stupid or are less than 14 which also means that you are stupid.
ThUnD3r don't forget Jake Paul.
1:40 That's his excuse?! What a dumbass!
This is a great start to 2018, isnt it...
LOGAN IS JUST A PERSON HE MAKES MISTAKES
Chris Stilling Ill just tell you that this wasnt a mistake
I love Logan Paul
Sharon Goodin why?
"hes only 22" no dont say it like hes a kid, hes a full grown ass adult. dont try and pity him, hes got everything he deserves from this.
Well that is the result, when people put acknowledge over experience...
Just because one in the age of, let us say, 18 years old who red tons of books or other stuff like that, doesnt mean that you are mature enough.
In the other side, when we talk about doing "things", everybody already knows what is false or not.
I mean when you are shocked enough while filming a dead hanging body, you will be conscious enough to cut that scene off after that.
Emma Frost I just dont agree with you as far as age goes. Age is just a label in my opinion. Its whether your mind has matured or not. Yeah Logan Pauls mind probably hasnt fully matured yet because he shouldve turned off that camera. Now hes probably going to lose some endorsements and fans.
FraznoFire yes to quote a wise man
Hey dumbass you did something stupid in the past you can be criticised for it
Imagine yourself in a funeral, do you film the body and make jokes on it? no
Nica dade- To any youtubers out there
just because there's a dead body, that doesnt mean he/she  hve the right to record it.  In the first place, using a dead body in a video is wrong. That was a person's life.
Why did he laugh about?
the only problem i have is ITS SUBSCRIBERS NOT FOLLOWERS
that is not okay he is not going to sit there and laugh about suicide
Fuck the Paul brothers! This is a great thing!
'apparently' 'allegedy'
Suicide is sad but its also pretty selfish to keep someone in a world they don't wanna be in for YOUR satisfaction, there's worse things in the world than suicide...like Californians!
Im number 1 fan of logan paul but he showing no respect and he just laught of the dead body
Logan paul is annoying anyway. Click bait etc
Hopefully he learns something from this and leaves Japan ASAP and NEVER EVER come back to our country. Japanese people do hate him.
I feel your pain as I would feel totally the same as you do now if some stupid immature 22 year old Japanese guy did something like this in other countries. Please do not worry as Japanese also knows that the majority of Americans are sensible and this guy really is just minority. I cant wait to see his youtube account deleted permanently.
You guys are pure trash
This is absolutely awful. Even if he apoligized, showing a body of someone who took their own life is absolutely disgusting. There are even kids who look up to Logan and they had to see this and see him laugh and joke about a person who has taken his own life. This is unforgivable and he should not get the views and subscribers that he gets now. And trying to say that he was trying to raise awareness he should have just sat down and had a talk with the camera instead of trying to stay overnight in a suicide forest amd show the body of someone who had taken his own life. Why hasn't YouTube banned him yet. He deserves it.
Logan what did you do this time
Saw video Well Logan youve fucked up
Why watch any news station when wanting to learn about the internet when you can just watch Phillip DeFranco
Even when he apologized no one will fucking care  because what he did was unacceptable "I didn't do it for views I get views" shut the fuck up you clowned around and played with the body and laughed and joked around a simple apology is not going to cut it
1:39 i guess you could say he " apPAULogised" 
Don't you mean he tried to defend his career?
RIFN _ lol
yeah he should get banned
logan paul said he didnt do it for views, that he gets views already, true he gets views but he did it for even more views. how can you say you did it to raise awareness yet you and your hyena friends are laughing. logan paul has no respect for real families that have lost loved ones and he doesnt respect the dead. he's a moron that logan paul
I cant stand him,  hes so annoying, loud and his videos make no sense. Not his fault our children made him rich though. It was just a matter of time for him to fuck up and he just did. Best thing about this is hopefully this is the end for him, although his brother still out there 
Omg abc news too
I don't care I still love logan
R.I.P to all the youtubes money
I havent heard anybody dropping him Why not
Listen Logan Paul, go deep into the woods alone , you have a good chance you will not be able to make it back and bocome one of those corpses.
You better choice is adventures with Christian he never cusses hes a good man
And for me to think Logan was the better brother, I guess their both dumbasses
Fuck 2020
He found a dead body.  Lets destroy his life for it!!  People are fucking haters. All of you sicken me. I hope Kim smashes his big ass button and kills us all.
I had never heard of this guy !
I watched the video, i saw no video of him showing the body. People are only attacking him because he has somewhat successfully made a name for himself, lokk on youtube,  look up that japanese forrest, you will see many video's,  some graphic. Sick world.
So Logan started the new year bad
I didn't saw the vid :(
He's an idiot... who shows a dead man on a video...and LAUGHS? He's such an a***ole... :/
 fuck off it's over geez
I am 11 I was a fun of Logan until I saw this I hate this guy now who would do something like this Logan you have lost a big fan
omg, why are yall making a big deal out of this!?
Youtube will not do anything to this guy. He need to loose all the sponsors and get his channel take down.
Logan Paul has autism we got to kick him off YouTube
I hate what this world had come to, I can tell some people in the comment section are adult and are saying" I glad my kids don't watch Logan paul" Bruh most of Logan subscribers are 12-18 and I don't give a fuck if people comment to me saying"Logan is a bitch and doesn't deserve fame" EVERYONE IS NOT PERFECT did you guys think Jesus or God was perfect?No
I'm 12 years old and these days 10 and 11 year old understand suicide  and what Logan did was probably unforgivable But I'm a forgiven person if they apologize and Delete a video that Logan did do I'll forgive him most people in the comment section are just fucken hated or Just believe any kind of bullshit I'M OUT PEACE!
and don't respond to this comment if your not a Loganer!
Well, he's not kind hearted. That's for sure. https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/232315523713622016
People say Maverick 4 life or Logang and then as soon as he does what every human ever does (makes a mistake) people treat him like shit. No one on this planet is perfect and you need to understand that.
@Jared_official8
Pewdiepie still the best
Omg now this bullshit is on ABC News. Wow 2018 has started out real good! *Sarcasm*
Omg he didn't do it for views. FUCK YOU LOGAN PAUL
y doesn't he just delete the video
I didn't get to watch it
That thumbnail would fit better on an episode of doctor phil then ABC news
So we bring more attention to it and him so he gets more money. I swear some people just dont get it. This is what he wanted
He looks like an IDIOT!
Why the fuck are kids what Watching this
https://youtu.be/y_Y3U8OktAQ it would mean the world if you share this video I want everyone and even Logan to see that I will always be in the logang no matter what because everyone makes a mistake
They are voting to delete his YouTube channel  there goal is 75,000 and they have 65,000 ...
Way to start 2018
stop. making. stupid. people. famous. "i dont need views, i get views". wow so cocky. "durr lets go into a suicide forest, im sure nobody on YouTube would show you this, more $$ and views!" they have common sense that's why. im sure the person who killed themselves didnt want to be gawked at or filmed  like that as they left the world. jesus man.
I hope him and his brother get kicked off of YouTube.
I see people wearing Maverick or Logang mercy at school...more and more everyday...
Zainab Naeem omg god help your school 
Don't follow them
He was way out of line
So he fucking laughs ? Its degrading, he's a joke!
That moment when the news is too stupid to release that people only subscribe to this jackass ironically
Ahhhh very funny Just watch my latest video about this shit
He didn't show the body at all it was blurred out.
he didnt say that youre just making him look even worse he is already under enough pressure
its called the suicide forest so why should we care about the people that died in the forest
Growing up experience?
Jake Pauler 4 Life
OH IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE! I MISTAKENLY UPLOADED A DEAD PERSON ON THE INTERNET!!!! TOTALLY NOT A FUCKING CHOICE, OOOHHGH WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE! SORRY YOUTUBE, MY 10 YEAR OLD FANS, PLEASE KEEP DEFENDING ME!
I am a 14 year old teen and i like logan paul but after he posted the video of the body i was disgusted at what he did logan you disappoint me
FUCK HIM
Yep. Still hate the Paul brothers...
Who the fuck cares there are more problems in this world than this fucktards video
Logan's platform is bilt by kids which suke's because all kids see is like he did not get in tribal it all for vuse so they go an do it thinking its okay in till they get in trobal which suks four kids generasen
You know you fucked up when Sophie Turner calls you out.
*B-BUT I InTENDED TO rAISE AWARENESS FoR SUICIDE AND SUICIDE pReVENTION!!!*  
Meanwhile: zooms on the hanged man and makes fun of the body while his friends giggle 
He's not really sorry. He just said "sorry" so people will continue to follow him. Never once did he say anything about the poor soul who took his own life! It was all about HIM
Gerardo Barrera Wut the fuck is wrong with u? U dont know him or wut he deserved and his death is not funny whatsoever. Only a psychopath would find the loss of life funny
Seras Victoria shut up
Seras Victoria he killed himself not us thats what he gers
Seras Victoria dude duck the dead body its funny
Your ugly and stooped and a itot
No wonder Japan doesnt let foreigners to immigrate into there country
Pariah Carey Very mature to call someone names as if that will make you sound smart about something.
Mr_Splashman21 thank you (^^)
Minuki DE SILVA its different immigration isnt just any immigration to any country. You need a reason like a job or something there its really hard to get in
Pariah Carey its because of England is being flooded with Islamic scumbags
LIEX 440 keyboard warrior alert
Why record it why record it....stfu i don't know 1 person with a camera  who doesn't record shit when it hits the fan i would've recorded the shit too ...stop being hypocrites
Did he really showed the whole corpse? Like the hand etc.? If yes then  thats fucked up
I'mJustNobody thats just crazy he should have noticed this during the editing process  that its dumb to upload on YT. He as a Person is just digusting. He did not  only go into the forest but into the streets of Tokyo with disrespectful atittude. Like wtf....
Enternal Abyss yes he did, he stood like 2 feet away from the man
The human race is so stupid
on one hand Logan definitely deserves the onslaught that he's receiving for his dipshit decisions but on the other i as a part of the youtube community view this as a potential attempt to diss the site. I could be wrong. i probably am. anyways the message of this comment: I despise Logan & Jake. I love youtube.
Kill it with cum
what do you mean apparent suicide victim ? what do you mean alleged ? change it
Never come to Japan never please. Alright you went in the forests and found it,but,why posted it? When you're in other country,you're like a representative of your own nation. So you shouldn't have done such things and that's an insult to our nation and people in America. Your gag is not always allowed everywhere.
They said allegedly ALLEGEDLY !!!!!!!!!!!!
Bullshit he did it for views him and his friends were looking at each other laughing while the guy was still hanging. He showed no remorse at all.
I Mean guys he not that popular I mean the smosh and dan tdm there are other YouTubers who are more popular And not sick like him
He's a grown man. He's not no damn kid. Real question to those who support him. What if it was someone close to you he blasted like that with jokes for the world to see? Would you still support him?
Now you see guys every year nothing good will happen  2018 god dame
Proof that internet fame makes ppl retarded, these kids get dumber and dumber by the second
Logan you are disgraceful
I dont know which am I logang or jake pauler
Even if he apologized but he's still an dumbass
Im joining cloutgang peace 
Im disapointed smiling and laughing thats terrible  that poor person that commited suicide they probably were depressed or worse its sad that he was so desperate for likes views and more ideas for clickbait....
I love Logan how he can do this
Logan: I like money
At least he ended up owning to it
this is just a theorie but what if he did all of this to get even bigger maybe he wanted his name to spread across the internet this is most likely not true but think about it
I meant to say in that maybe he wanted his name to spread across the internet like this I already know he's really popular
Logang For life.. He made a mistake and every human being makes them.. He took down the video and made an apology without anyone asking and he is not even posting anymore.. he deserves a punishment but not A lifetime thing..
i just don't get it why ppl love his content so much!
all i can say is, youtube is not the right place for young ppl.
pleasem be wise with content
What about rice gum he made fun about suicide in reacting to the new team ten house huh no one did anything about that and you guys take the topic on Logan paul is it just bc rice gum is irrelevant??@rice
LOGAN PAUL FOR LIFE HE SAID SORRY YOU DUMB FUCKS IF YOU DID IT I BET U WOULD GIVE TO FUCKS U WOULD PROBABLY LAUGH
Im one of the 6 mil ppl that saw the vlog and it was disturbing and ppl out there that are going through this plz tell your friends or family and tell them to help you everyone is special!
LOGANG 4 LIFE!
Holy shit
https://youtu.be/4FDSdg09df8
Here's two things I would have changed about the video. 
1. Showing the body (even though the face is blured) 
It's obviously distasteful, disrespectful and senseless. He should have put the camera away, and talked about it later in the vlog. 
2. Tell everyone that suicide is a serious issue and should not be joked about est...
Only to follow it up with laughter and running around like a child. And than joking around in the carpark about it and acting silly.
He contradicted himself. 
I get that he's young and all but, what was he thinking?
Logan paul you ruied my childhood
I love Logan paul
mckayla Thompson no one asked
mckayla Thompson excuse me birch no one wants YOU HERE FUCK OFF NO ONE HERE LIKES YOU BUT THE STUPID LOGANG
Bria Taylor even so WHY POST IT THEN WHY SHOW THAT MAN SO MUCH DISRESPECT because apparently to the logang what he did was ok because he said sorry
Unicorn Queen if you love him then you must think he was so smart to be a stupid fucking idiot to post that video
mckayla Thompson what he said was right and you know it.. also
You will swallow whatever he throws at you. If your over 12 your mental age is very low
Wtf Logan Paul!
I didnt do it for views fuck yeah he did it for views and joking/laughing about it is disgusting and disrespectful. Also putting the dead body as the thumbnail of the video is clickbait to get views
logan is a dumbass. Pity traumatized  young fans
*STAR* FUCK OFF
I like how they sucked his dick lmao
Shut up bitch
Well he ain't ever going back to Japan
I am officially sick of people instead of scrolling to see the dead body look at the beginning when Logan gives a graphic warning and also says if you have any thoughts of suicide then to call the suicide hotline and in the end of the video he talks for 3 minutes straight they you should never commit suicide so in all its your fault for clicking on the video
Oh my god really ok so he wanted to help people and if you watched the video he said that if you were getting bullied that they were here for you and if you ever thought about to talk to someone and to let them know not to be scared honestly I took that video to heart because I have been bullied and it is out there people do it people get bullied all the time it happens ok so I dont see the big deal here he wanted to help those who were thinking that way or getting bullied he blurred out the face he showed at least a little respect he was trying to make the blog not seem so sad by adding a little joke in there Im sure all of you have made one joke about that at least once not saying you should but he has that many subscribers for a reason he is inspiring so just drop it if he gets banned from YouTube well I will just be sad all the time when I come home and watch his vlogs it makes me happy and forget about all the bad stuff in the world
So 2018 Just started and basically u guys are giving Logan Paul the worst year by talking about his big mistakes everyone makes mistakes ok
The world can fuck off

Yet he laughed while filming it.
He went into the suicide forest. A place where thousands of people kill themselves every year. What did he expect to see? A squirrel riding a dragon?
Edit: I like all the people calling me names and stuff defending him. Like where are your parents? Stop watching youtube and pay attention. Second grade ain't going to pass itself.
I now want to see a squirrel riding a dragon
Hes the shittiest piece of shit that was ever shit out
Mr. Moo omg! you just made me laugh harder! 
Ash and Lola omg! you made me laugh so hard  thanks!
Lil Jess he make another vid title "So Sorry" do you even logang
WHY...... WHY BECOME LIKE JAKE?!?!!???!!!?!!!?!??!!
Influencer  This makes me sick 
Who needs one?
Jaime Magana you make me sick
Jaime Magana yas afcors
Echoes Act 3 I'm guessing it's mocking the Logan Paul fans
Alicia Lopez do you speak english?
He knows it is a mistake before he even posted the video, and he had chosen to post it anyway. I am glad kids in my country doesn't watch Logan (because of language).
*YES MAKE THEIR PARENTS KNOW WHAT THEIR KIDS IS WATCHING, LET THEM KNOW BEFORE OUR FUTURE ARE DOOMED*
Logan Paul...what a fucker! He showed a dead BODY
WHY IS HE GETTING SO MUCH HATE
e had all the time in the world about thinking to post that video. Common sense to not post a dead guys corpse on YouTube even if there are children watching.
Fangla Potter you're asking why when something as disgusting as this happens 
And all the reasons people are
Leaving team 10 and everything
Stop Logan  isn't a bad person
I honestly have no idea why people r making this such a big deal. Youtubers record themselves finding dead bodies and don't get so much hate from it :/
Subscribers not followers
Plzz don't destroy logan paul
He laughed because he did not expect to see a dead body .
There are various reaction of people 
Some people have a strong hart while some have a soft hart
We are not destroying him, we'll just hate him
DR tv He did it himself...
He did it to himself it's what he deserves you will find other vloggers who are carbon copies of him. He deserves the punishment.
DR tv he basically did it himself by laughing at a corpse...
No one gives a fu**
Video: https://youtu.be/NxpvV992x-g
https://youtu.be/lGk0Hy3LlN4
come on! It was his first time seeing a dead body what do you expect his reaction to be?!?!
here's his unedited video: https://youtu.be/JVy_NQ1q7DU  ...your welcome.
What a fucking DISGRACE. 
You have 12 year old fans and you showed that. 
What fucking DUMBASS. 
He said its not for views, but that was clearly for VIEWS AND SUBS. 
Rip Man 
Rest in pepperoni
Yeah them *Subscribers* are going... *falling airplane sound* 
The news didnt even put the whole fucking apology of logan
Fuck jake & logan. Fucking losers
The Paul's should be banned from the internet.
Monster12255 no they shouldnt be It was one mistake
Monster...ban this, ban that, censor this, censor that....where do you live? China???
Ajit Pai got u
Shut up never
Mitchell Ellis Nigga you should go to jail for being alive
Clearly he is not sorry, and what's worse is he gets paid to act like a complete ass and he gets to make America look retarded when visiting another country....please rethink your life Logan....please.
Fifteen million *followers*
She didnt read the whole statement that Logan said this is dumb
Found a *dead body* in suicide forest...
Cut your hair you scrub
I DONT EVEN LIKE LOGAN I LIKE JAKE PAUL
Its almost as though youre favouring this guy. Youre using Logan Pauls quote marks a moment in YouTube history as though he has learnt his lesson. You also put aside a lot of the issues, for instance filming the body up close and giggling/laughing.
Address the story fully instead of making it into a short 2 minute video covering the broad version of the story.
AT LEAST HE TOOK DOWN THAT VIDEO JEEZ MAN
Why does he get all the hate for it when I go to Logans video theres other videos like his that show up
I actually hope he quits YouTube, then the internet won't have so much drama (could be real or fake drama)
He should do what he wants. Fuck the business.
Ok he said sorry plz stop he dont mess to have to delete his channel like daddyofive for no reason he is a big youtuber he said sorry leave him alone
well, a simple "sorry" won't bring you far. if he would be "sorry" he wouldn't even go there and make a vlog and after that laugh about it! you need to open your eyes!
not trynna ruin your dreams kid but sometimes apologizing wont get it through espicelly through these victims family
Courtney Hunter so if someone just killed a family and apologized, you think its all right??
This is so sad what people will do for views and money is insane. He even showed a dead corpse in the video to young possibly pre-pubescent children. He thought this was okay. He filmed this, He edited this and, He uploaded this knowing that young audiences are exposed to his vlogs. He already fucked up the start of the yearI hope you all learn something from this: Suicide is not a joke. It shouldnt be laughed at. He had no right to do this, there is no excuse hes 22 years old.
Vivian Tessier I completely agree. Suicide and depression are horrible things and i don't think they should be shielded from children but nor do i think a person should laugh about a persons hanging corpse.
honestly he is not the first youtuber I've seen to go to the suicide forest and end up filming a body... but that no excuse for how he treated the situation.
yeah you're right. But the other vids I've seen just act more respectful about it..
LalaGirl the thing that is getting Logan in so much controversy is that he was literally making fun of the situation... and even if he hadn't made fun of it he still shouldn't have kept the man's body in the video, out of respect for the family. He knew he had a way for this not to blow up on him but he decided to keep that stuff in the video... but yes I don't know how everyone would react in that situation but he knows why that forest is famous so he should have expected the possibility of finding a body.
Brendan _1 nervousness maybe? Be more open-minded  about situations and how people react as well, it was his first time seeing a dead body in person, Dont expect him to react a normal way BC that doesn't exist
Great when you have nothing to think about for the news you go to youtube for fuck sake
You're not gonna demonetize this for the title, YouTube? You wanna be consistent with your guidelines?
Yes he did post it but he said that he didnt know what to do so its not his fault. I mean it is his fault for posting it but still he didnt know what to do so he posted it, but yes I know that doesnt make it ok but he said sorry about 1,000 times and he didnt know what else to say he feels bad for what he did, but he didnt do it for views and all the people thats saying that he deserves a punishment you make me sick because your saying that he meant to do it UMMM YA NO he didnt so just give it a rest and let the professionals deal with it. JEEZ!!!!!!
He said sorry twice. Talked all about him in the apology did not even reference the poor man. Laughed at a corpse filmed it and made a clickbait filled title. He made MONEY off this video and all the money went to him the family, a suicide charity saw no money at all he did not do this for awareness or by mistake he uploaded that video to make money by choice,
Breana Stearns 
-He could've stopped filming BUT he didn't
-He could've stopped when he was editing the video BUT he didn't 
-He could've stopped when he was making that repulsive thumbnail BUT he didn't 
-He could've stopped when he was about to make the video public on YouTube BUT he didn't 
He had MANY chances to stop what he was doing and PLENTY of time throughout the creation of the video to think things through BUT he made these choices regardless. And why? It's most certainly NOT for suicide prevention or awareness. 
Also, I find it very hard to believe he would go into the "Suicide Forest" willingly and not expect to come across a dead person like that. Makes you wonder what his intentions were in the first place, especially considering he knew what that place was YET still went in there, camera in hand. Don't bullshit me, it's obvious this was for views. Why else would you go into a place like that in the first place? It's not known for some happy tourist site where you can fool around.
Breana Stearns Really? What world do you live in? Because hate to burst your bubble but that's NOT how the adult world works. You do or say something, there's always a price that comes with it. Actions has consequences. If everything can be resolved by saying "sorry", then everyone would get off scott free just by apologizing. 
Logan can say sorry all he wants, but it still doesn't change the fact that what he consciously did was fucked up for any decent human being. This was NOT a "Oh I slipped up" kind of mistake. This was a series of CHOICES made leading up to him making that video public on YouTube.
Yeah let's just say sorry and everything is all jolly cause that's definitely how the world works. 
Logan Paul has severely fucked up and has been extremely disrespectful and has hurt and offended many many people who are going through shit like this which is not a laughing matter and he does deserve to be criticized for his actions and people do have the right to criticize him for this.
Back woods he didnt do it for views if he did we cant change that, and yes he is old enough to no right from wrong but still he said sorry and we should just leave it at that and let the professionals deal with it
Logan is a dumb cxnt
He should have died with vine
i hate people -_-
Cloutgang 4 life
Im talking about his popularity, not ACTUALLY DIE XD

Glaucia norah Dumb ass child, stay in school.
Nemu how bout dat Stay in school, kid.
2018 Started off great!
Im a kid and Im watching it
Try to stop me bitch
POISONWAVE Im 12 so stfu
Doggyboi 9 year olds like you dont deserve technology
POISONWAVE fuck you
Doggyboi fuck Logan
It seems like Logan threatened the Lady of Winterfell and currently Head of House Stark.
I'm so sorry for the parents of the person who was dead in the tree because can you imagine e seeing your dead child in a tree getting jokes about and played with it's just sick
Who cares !!
I walked into homeroom and he was on the TV.
and then he gets even popular and all the attention he wants he gets. win win for news channels and him
I watched that video along with a lot of other people and just like everyone else I felt disturbed
Why hasn't he lost endorsements
F you
Yea raise awareness for suicide *BY* making fun of a dead person
Uh huh, he totally was trying to raise "suicide awareness" he makes me sick, honestly.
Hey I didnt know that its a big deal to make fun of a dead guy
"A growing up experience" Really? That's all you have to say?
I can't believe this happened wow
Why do they even have a suicide forest or what ever it's called but it's on the news so this is bad
I remember when he faked being colorblind for views and attention. That's the type of person he is.
Stop use the mistake of Logan to get views!! Its horrible! If you think that logan did a mistake, don t speak about it only to get views and subscribers. You need more inspiration of vido! I m not for logan but i know than if you do the same error, the impact will be lower and you Will not want people who decrease you!
Never heard of him!
Leave him alone
You shut it
You're probably like 9 so let me explain in terms you'll understand  He's 22. He's an adult and knows what's right and wrong. He laughed at a dead man. In the forest, there's places you're allowed to walk. He chose to walk into areas he isn't allowed to. He messed up BIG time and all on purpose. He knows his fans are all like 10 and shows kids dead bodies. Not okay at all.
Pre-dead meme loool real shit
You can defend someone you like but not for this he did something sick and disgusting he let millions of people watch one of the most sensitive moments of a man who was so lonely and felt so empty taking his own life was his only choice. To that man's family that's how they found out he died on some youtube vlog. He can be as sorry as he wants even though he doesn't seem genuine, it's unforgivable he even said so himself he has to be banned  his actions have to be punished.
Daphne Lopez hes getting off lightly. Dou know how many people would like to beat him, torture him and most people, put a bullet into his face.
mistakes happen automatically, don't hate on Logan!! 
Cathy Pham how the fuck was it an accident? He literally filmed the body, laughed about it, took time to edit that video and posted it onto YouTube. He even made it the thumbnail. Do you know how disrespectful that is? He couldve just stopped recording but no. He kept recording and even went way too close to the body and even ZOOMED IN ON THE BODY. Thats disgusting how he just does all of that and he posts it onto YouTube like it was nothing. Thats is not an accident. He did it on purpose, and he clearly wanted views.
Cathy Pham  are you retarded? You see a corpse and laugh? WTF is wrong with you? "Oops he ded lets laugh and take some close  ups, meybe even not feel bad about him or his family, im sure they are alright"
Oh he accidentally went into a there and accidentally filmed the body and accidentally laughed at it and accidentally kept that part of the video in...yup sounds like one big accident
I takes time to edit a video. He literally watched himself do it while he edited it, and you call it an accident!?
I think she meant mistakes not accidents
Hes lying Hes not say sorry he was forced to say sorry Dont believe him
You know you fucked up when you got ABC talking about you...
Jarrett not always
i m so mad why will he sow a dead body we all dot like that 
ugandan knuckles!!!!!!!
yeah why the fuck else would he be on the news showing a fucking body he is so stupid why why would he show a dead body so sad im taking my subbes away from him
Acually he drives a $400,000 vehicle...just saying
the news station brought up the wrong facts in this video so it does have something to do with it
Zbox3000 what does a car have to do with this?
The Lovely Rhodonite I know, just saying, ABC dont have all the facts
Zbox3000 that doesn't make him a nice/ good person
All he cares about is money and views
This is news?
Guys don't be harsh on him he is cool. Ya he messed up but still it was not on perpess. He did not show the face of the man who killed him self.and it is not the first time this has happened
Yeah go tell your parents what that sociopath did and then say to your parents faces you still love Logan. I promise you they'll drag you off to a psychiatrist in a flash
Shouldn't you hit puberty before posting about such a matter
Ffs you can't spell so you're clearly like 11. Stfu because its fucking disgusting what he did. You don't know anything on this sort of awful shit so be quiet
Being cool is definitely NOT doing things like this! That's DISGUSTING, NOT COOL! You poor brainwashed child , i feel sorry for you. Worse things happened? Yeah , and that's why there are prisons , for horrid people like that who feel no remorse about someone dying.
Andrew Daugherity Im just wondering; what does Logan have to do for you to NOT forgive him? Kill someone? Live stream himself raping his dog? You all seem to have set the line too far, whatever he does he can be forgiven as long as he says sorry. Believe it or not, but you can be a fan of someone and STILL disagree with their actions and call them out for it.
Erase the video can t you see logan is apolighy
Esteban Nunez-Jacobo  are you retarded? You see a corpse and laugh? WTF is wrong with you? "Oops he ded lets laugh and take some close  ups, meybe even not feel bad about him or his family, im sure they are alright"
Esteban Nunez-Jacobo if you cant even spell, get out of here go play mine craft.
0:35-0:36 Did she say 15 million followers and not subscribers like ok if u come at Logan you have to know what the things he doing kinda hard to explain for me but SHE SAID FOLLOWERS
fools see his new sory vedio
Who's side are on Logans Or People that are hating...
I agree with people who are hatin
You may not know your kids are watching this guy
leave him alone yes it was wrong but just stop. this is what starts suicide
jorge the dog fuck u idiot
He is strong he will get over it when he is kicked off youtube which he deserves to be. He filmed a corpse and laughed at it knowing his audience is mainly CHILDREN. He should be banned from Youtube end of story.
I know right. It was wrong, but it was one mistake. And exactly, hate is something that starts suicide
are we really thinking he gives a fuck about anybody who suffers from depression and you need to shut the fuck up you think this shits what causes suicide you need to get a reality check people commit suicide for millions of reasons but online backlash from showing a man who just lost his life sounds insane
Darth Reaper 
u just shut him down lol
15 million followers. 15 million not so smart people.
Logan Paul is an idiot.
Sad thing is nothing will happen to him, he is a rich dumb ass white privileged American kid. He could care less.
On behalf of all the kids who were born after the year of 1999, I would like to apologise for the kids who made Logan and Jake profoundly popular, as they are their target demographic. I surely hope that my generation will grow wiser and learn about someone before blindly following trends and new slime tutorials. Once again, I sincerely apologise.
I literally hope that Logans ass channel gets deleted from YouTube
No high schooler watches Logan Paul its mainly like ages 7-13
Stfu be a maverick
Ericsson Mora-Guzman, you shut up.
It will be better for mental health to just think that this was a joke comment.
Doesnt matter, Donald Trump is still president
lol lol I hope you are trolling and not being serious
whaT THE FUCK ???
It's just a stunt to make money people
Seeing all the comments defending him are making me insane
I hope he gets sued or something for what he did to the poor person! What a jackass!
a great way to start 2018... there goes his money and also his love and support from "fans". he screwed up big time, his apology won't be enough.
He proves that you can make it even if you are ugly or/talentless
this is unbelievable
I honestly wish Logan Paul would die in a car accident.
Yall needa know this is their business not ours he posted it he accepted its was a mistake we all make mistakes u prob dont even know ur making a mistake until later so dont talk cz im hella pissed
Wow, what a mess  clearly you're like 10, so learn to spell, check your grammar, know when to use commas and quotation marks when writing a paragraph because few of my brain cells died after reading your obnoxious comments....just stay in school. And it's one thing not being perfect and another being inhumane. It wasn't a mistake, he knew what he was doing he gets PAID for his views, he doesn't give a shit about anyone. And apparently we are immature for judging him? He's somehow sooo much more mature by posting a suicide victim, and you must be EXTRA mature for agreeing with his post. Get your head out of your ass, child. You won't be hearing from me at all.
Bcfs Vlogs/gamers mmm English?
Bcfs Vlogs/gamers Im sorry but this is just absurd. You fans wont back down so Ill show my way out, you have a good day!
But u judging ppl certainly makes u mature wow
Oh Im certainly not perfect and Im trying to judge anyone, Im merely stating facts. The fans are minimizing how serious this incident was and it shouldnt be. This is extremely serious and you guys are belittling it. You swearing and calling everyone dumbass doesnt make you any mature than what people expect from you 
Hes a total dumbass and a moron. Total disrespectful to the people of Japan and to those who took their own lives.  Very American, good job!
F u bro.
Dont shut down Logans channel please I need to watch him because he makes me laugh and not think to kill my self I was going through depression
No Im not
Jojo K how does someone who laughed at someone who committed suicide make you.. omg I can't ur probably just a kid who doesn't know how disgusting an horrible he is
How is he 22 years old and this fucking stupid, YouTube should just remove his account already
*Insert me Wanting too slap him in the face*
2017: Logan's career takes off
2018: End of Logan's career
Suck my duck bitchhhhhh I'm lil pump Jr bitchhhh eskitttttttt
You guys r just haters, I luv h8ers bc they only make me strongr :))) #iqdeficiency
Couldn't he just stop posting videos
" I don't need views. I get views. "
Narcissistic. I used to like him, Not Jake, But now I hate both. :/ I've hated him for about 5 months now ;p
But am in the logang
Darth Reaper C'mon he's just a kid, unlike Logan he doesn't know any better. Do you even realise what you're saying?
Jaime Pedroza Give your parents this number: 108335765 its for an abortion clinic that takes care of children up to 22 years of age. If you say Darth Reaper sent them they get an 80% discount
Fuck news
His attitude has always been shitty, he's always been arrogant, it's sad that it took something this bad for people to finally have any negative feelings about this idiot
Stop posting about that video! He is mad at himself for posting that!
He did it for views.
His way of saying he didnt do it for views, cause he gets views, I hope Im not the only one hearing how petty it sounds and how he is missing the damn point
R.I.P Logan Paul
What a douchebag.
YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH LOGAN'S SO SORRY VIDEO WITH THE CAPTIONS ON ITS NOT GOOD!!!!!
YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH LOGAN'S SO SORRY VIDEO WITH THE CAPTIONS ON ITS NOT GOOD!!!!!
Posting this was completely wrong and he deserves to be called a idiot or stupid for posting. But unless you or someone close was effected by depression you dont deserve to say things like he deserves to burn in Hell which a woman who has never been effected by depression went on tmz and said about Logan. True you can call Logan Scum for posting this he deserves it but I think wishing death onto others and saying things like Burn In Hell makes you worst than scum.
What video is it ?
I just hope that he keeps posting but something has to happen to him
For the better
Take down his channel and jail
He did not mean too just shut up
Look if you rewatch logans video he said he blured the face to hide the identety he didnt want to give any info away about the person and he said suicide is not a joke a the only time he laughed was when brendon was like i don't feel good and logan said"you haven't stood next to a dead body before" that has nothing to do with suicide or depression so u all should chill i get that he filmed a dead body but so what it is like filming someone alive they nost likey dont care and it was to show that people really do kill them selves so reply to this comment if u have anything to say be a maverick
Wtf is everyone freaking out about? Is everyone mad about him simply filming a dead body or is it because he was mocking the dead body on camera? I didn't get to watch the video he took down so if anyone could reply I'd appreciate it.
Now I know people make mistakes and Logan needs to pay , which he most likely will but can we talk about the pure blind misplaced vehement faith his fans have in him? It's not only unrealistic  it's extremely  unhealthy it's almost as if there whole lives revolve  around  Logan and or Jake Paul... not to say this phenomenon  hasn't  happened  before with stars and actors but a good majority of the time they either admitted  their mistakes, ended up dead or said action was never forgotten but this right here? This is just fanaticism.  Plain and simple
I checked out a couple of videos on this and I haven't seen a dead body in any of them
The only positive from this is that maybe it will remove some of the romanticism of suicide that young people have. But yeah, stupid move on his part.
Please make a ripple? Raise awareness? By being a fool and laughing yeah thats helpful.
Yeah no, there's already awareness. Why do you think the forest is named that if the authorities weren't aware? There's no way for logan to recover from this no matter the apology, he made suicide a joke. He had an opportunity to talk about to an audience of 12yr olds in a serious manner and he just goes making fun of it.
Ok so when all you people make a mistake you all are going to die because if he can't make a mistake then you have no right to ether
*I intended to raise awareness for suicide* 
PFFFFFFFFFFFFT
They hate Logan don't they.
"I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet." "I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention." 
Yep, because the best way to do these things is obviously to make fun of a dead body.
Well that's a great way to start the year 
one thing the reporter said was right he is 22 and this is a growing up learning exsperiance
He needs to be banned from YouTube.
Y  do u guys still hav it on top trending on twwiter first of all
How can this turd get so popular acts like a fool
I hate how tv says it so its seams worst...
Fake news
His new video is 20 million more money for him DISGUSTING
I saw this in the morning with my mom and I asked why he was in trouble and she said that he laughed looking at a dead body...
Now logan's the one to blame for what youtube has done to other youtubers
A growing up experience? This should be a reevaluate humanity as a whole experience. There should be no more endorsements for him, and he should definitely be expelled from making YouTube videos.
Sarah Nicole Hi! I saw your comment.
I just want to let you know that I made a video about Logan Paul and this serious problem 
I hope you can join me, it is critical to know: be respectful to a person's death
LalaGirl Logan Paul fan girl alert.
No! This is not how the world works! If a man rapes a girl, he still gets a job somehow but raising awareness for suicide, you should suddenly not have a job? STFU!
And lets take a meer second to think Oh wait none of u haters can hes young I would have done the same thing you would also ur not gonna admit it you call him bad words you thrash him and u haters NEVER EVER EVER EVERRR think what if I was in his position. Huhhhhhhhh -show time
That's why I love Roman Atwood  #bestyoutuber
Yeah, right. Suicide awareness. He had no respect for that person. He also seemed that he could care less in the video. Was all a big joke to him. Sick.
*so Disney, can uhh i have the job*
Kylee Hattett Jake was fired from Disney
Super Stealth
*plis*
Wrong brother!!!
Super Stealth  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Katie Wells they both had the job....
Stop hating on him he's just a kid trying to entertain people that support him
I logan pule
I been unsubsribe his immature ass. Fuck Logan Paul.  He need to go live under a bridge and eat road kill
I'm glad he showed the dead body bc it shows what the world has done to people which makes people commit suicide. Don't be hating logan paul, hate the world and the news for making shit up
Im tired of seeing this shit on trending
Hate that guy!
Not even the Disney channel flow can save him now.
Hes human thats all can say to the haters
Oh my god.
This makes me sad because I love to wach Logan Paul and I recently lost my grandmother and I'm 12 years old. I'm not allowed to curse but just this time. Logan Paul was a big fucking bitch
Glichraptor lol there are many kids under age of thirteen who have a youtube account.
Its bitch not bith by the way
Luke Tansiongco 12 year usually can think for themselves
> I'm 12 years old
um aren't you supposed to be AT LEAST 13 in order to use this site
catch this report fren
#logang4life
Kidding, I'm not a brainless fucktard
0:33-0:37 smh subscribers not followers
When ur followers r mostly 9 year old girls and u post a fucking suicide video what do u think will happen dumbass
Not follow it's subscribers
Alright. I'm 100% not a fan of him. His content bores me. I am going to state that everyone took this too far. I saw the video. Stop being so God damn sensitive to every little thing. Grow a set people. I saw nothing wrong with the video. He genuinely looked scared. He had no clue what to do. Him posting it was and is okay. If you get offended easily don't watch it. If you get offended easily and watch it....dont complain because you watched it.
I saw the video before he took it down. I knew that this would happen and all the hate and backlash he would get.
Who the fuck is Logan Paul?
He is so sorry I already know it I've been watching him since I was young
The apology video he made was under 2 minutes. Jenna Marbles made it to our video apologizing for being uninformed about fish care. Saying "i'm so sorry" then ending the video is not ok.
lizbeth nunez  are you retarded? You see a corpse and laugh? WTF is wrong with you? "Oops he ded lets laugh and take some close  ups, meybe even not feel bad about him or his family, im sure they are alright"
You're like 8 years old. Have you been watching from the womb?
Publicity stunt
Please don't do this he didn't know he's just 22 years old
lizbeth nunez honey 22 is an adult, you should definitely know right from wrong
Im 20 
Im not an idiot.
lizbeth nunez JUST A 22 YEAR OLD I'M 13 AND I KNOW THAT THAT WAS NOT OK
charlie25081 EVERYONE knows to not walk off the paths. He CHOSE to walk into other parts which you're NOT allowed to be in. It's called the suicide forest FOR A REASON.
lizbeth nunez The fucker is older than me
GUYS JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE
He didn't know
lizbeth nunez but he still went home to edit the video and posted it
lizbeth nunez  are you retarded? You see a corpse and laugh? WTF is wrong with you? "Oops he ded lets laugh and take some close  ups, meybe even not feel bad about him or his family, im sure they are alright"
I almost died laughing. HE DIDN'T KNOW???? You're telling me, when he saw the body, walked up to it, recorded it, laughed at it, edited the video, made the thumbnail, made the title and uploaded it that he didn't know?
lizbeth nunez yep totally didnt know. Even fucking 6 year olds know not to do this.
Glad mainstream media is showing how messed up this is, lets hope it changes things here on youtube.
Melissa ...."that need to be banned"??? Listen to yourself. Its called freedom of speech.
Joe Tyler why are you glad all of them will have a bad image? A lot of them are good. Just a few bad nuts that need to be banned.
Bris, a crazed madman?? Grow a pair prissy.
What is it that you want? More censorship?  Removal of questionable material? If YOU, don't like something, YOU don't watch it. Don't infect us with your sanctimony.
This is just my opinion and i know this is a news show but
Logan is a nice guy i swear and we cant judge his mistakes this video he made is his mistake he already removed it in his youtube so its gone we cant just judge him anymore and before you look at other peoples mistakes and judge on it think about yourself first... Thank you for reading that and i hope you understand it
unicorn believer How tf is this a mistake?  He intentionly went into a forest which is known for people commiting suicide every year and laughed at a dead body. He edited it and even put in the title "Found a dead body" This wasn't a mistake, it was a bad choice and Logan deserves every hate he's getting.
He's not doing it for views, how was anyone suppose to know that there was a dead body? Besides he deleted that video!  He didn't post that video for views, he did make a mistake but he did delete that video!
Honey there are no followers on youtube - theyre called subscribers
Welp, time for Jake I guess
Logan paul fucked up
Jake wouldn't laugh at the body and if we don't like him we all know that. Logan is just to cocky and YouTube is helping him with that
FUCK YOU YOUTUBE GET RID OF HIM AND HIS BROTHER.
Meanwhile in america
What did he do wrong?
Leave Logan alone he posted this and people watched it and yet in the beginning he says it himself its DISTURBING so if you watched and it was disturbing thats your fault
You know by showing this on the news you are making him even more famous, right?
i doubt its a good thing everyone hates him now
Zumran Nain hes already "more" famous
Zumran Nain duh
ONE MISTAKE JUST ONE MISTAKE AND THE WHOOOLLEE FRIKIN WORLD GOES IDK START DRAMA AND STUFF
Wolfy Doza  are you retarded? You see a corpse and laugh? WTF is wrong with you? "Oops he ded lets laugh and take some close  ups, meybe even not feel bad about him or his family, im sure they are alright"
same my aunt committed suicide when I was 5 years old.
Wolfy Doza 
"That wasnt a mistake. It is a reflection of who he is a human being" -DavidSoComedy
Wolfy Doza im just wondering; what does Logan have to do for you to NOT forgive him? Kill someone? Live stream himself raping his dog? You all seem to have set the line too far, whatever he does he can be forgiven as long as he says sorry. Believe it or not, but you can be a fan of someone and STILL disagree with their actions and call them out for it.
Wolfy Doza I completely agree. Well said.
Do we have that many snow flakes
His audience arent teens... theyre young children that dont understand what he did and what all they say is Logang logang logang maverick 4 life
Robert Marius grammarly is a app dumbass
GANG GANG GANG GANG GANG GANG GANGG NGA NGAN GA G AN GAN GNA G ANA G ANGANA G NA G
Matthew Taylor lol
Matthew Taylor I am a teen and I watch Logan and kids are not stupid okay
Him and his brother are idiot stupid insensitive mongrels
He didn't ignore the sucide though. He didn't sweep it under the rug. He showed it's real and happening right now. His post you are all calling disgraceful was probably the first time in months many have even thought of other people who have committed sucude. people do not react well to finding a body and respond with different coping mechanisms.
Dang Logan.. Youre all over the damn news! Now you know his career is over now
Holy shit Logan is in a news
We all make mistakes! He made a HUGE mistake but you need to forgive him. And also, ABC is saying a daily "show." No....research it a bit more ABC neews. It's your job, not that hard
DINGO DOG he doesn't need to be forgiven for the amounts of disrespect he gave to Japan and all of the children who saw it
I'm not going to be rude, since I understand this can be a pretty touchy topic, but this "mistake" is a very serious one to make. Logan was conscious of what he was doing and he should've known that showing a deceased body on the internet where *millions* of people were watching, *including* children is a very serious offense. He should definitely be aware if this, not only because its a big mistake, but because he's a grown man thats been on Youtube for a decade. Considering that, he should know uploading guidelines. That, along with what the family of the man would say. (God bless his soul... I pray for his family and that he's in a happier place...)
Are you serious fucking DEFENDING him?
It wasnt a mistake, he knew what he was doing. Its disgusting.
His apology clearly shows that he doesn't understand the magnitude of exploiting a real life corpse (let alone on that was fresh from suicide) in a Youtube video.
This nigga fucked up
He does vlogs unexpected shit happens
LOL HES ON THE NEWS DAMN 
I don't give a flyin FUCK what y'all think about Logan Paul. Logan's a good guy. He didn't mean to upset or hurt anyone. He apologized, shut the FUCK up about it, just act like it was never even posted. AND he didn't laugh AT the dead body, he even said he didn't. So just move on!
I love how his unborn fetus fans are so brainwashed they are calling this a mistake and acting as if he didn't know he would find a body in a place known as the suicide forest. He literally edited it and posted it just to get views and his apology video is fake considering he only posted after all this hate. For humanity's sake he and his brother need to take two liters of cyanide pills.
DAB ON THOSE THOTS! AND HATERS!
i see nothing wrong with what he did, this whole nation is just a bunch off wimpy crybabies.. get over it. if this was 10 years ago nobody what bat an eye!! so what does that mean? 10 years ago people where dumb and insensitive?? no it ment that they didnt get so consumed in their emotions
Internet meets the news
I just hate when some of Logans younger fans (like 10,11) try to defend him by insulting people. They just dont understand what kind of hole Logan personally dug and jumped into and it just really annoys me.
Im eleven am he should burn in hell and I understand suicide because I have considered it. It makes me so upset to see someone SO IGNORANT
Spencer Beardy just bc this is the internet doesnt mean its normal to say to someone to kill their self. like lighten up do you know how dumb you sound
Doc Bike if you love him as a YouTuber thats fine your opinion but as a person you cant like him
Hunter Abbott hey how about you do your homework lol bum ass kid
*Piper Wolfbook* your a 12 year old joke lol fuck you
It's the freakin 1st day of 2018 and there's this,  good job Logan,  good job,  (sarcasm) 
I feel bad for  all the children that watched that video. He is a role model for lots of kids,  and he shows this? This is unacceptable,  there should be a punishment for this. And no,  this isn't a situation that can be fixed by an apology,  there has to be much more of an apology than his video made recently, 'I'm Sorry'
people are overreacting
Finally someone might do something about this terrible guy...
Fu#% You Logan. Mother Fuc#%$
Im not protecting Logans acts but why do some people say that millions of little kids saw if the video was aged restricted
Daniel Godinez you can use make accounts with fake age 
Or use someone else phone who's older
#cloutgang
I can't trust this news outlet because they said followers in Stead of subscribers
You can hate on me because I dont care
OK to start off Logan is messed-up for doing this and he does deserve the criticism he's getting but we need to have sympathy to this guy YouTube is his only way of living a substantial life at the moment and if they take that away he has nothing and put yourself in his shoes I know he did it for the views if u guys found a dead body and made a promise to upload every-day what else will u record he trys so hard to make his vlogs interesting I believe even YouTube is having sympathy on him this is on #1 trending and YouTube hand picks those videos for him to be on trending is trying to spread the message that he his very sorry for his actions and it confuses me how all the people that hate him right now they can't tell me they haven't seen or heard of someone getting hurt  and laugh not saying what he did was right but still I people would be more caring these days #savehiscareer
Logan and his gay brother are just spastics who have no respect for other peoples kids or in this case someone who killed him self
He did do it for views he could of done suicide awareness in different ways than this he was just trying to cover himself up after what he did he is messed up
he should not have filmed the suicide and should not have posted it. His reaction was expected from him because hes a guy who probably doesnt know how to react to situations like that. He reacts to critical situations by trying to make the best out of them. They might laugh a bit and crack a joke. Sometimes it might seem inappropriate (which in this case it was) but thats how some people deal with it. Thats how my Mom dealed with her uncles death. However, it wasnt right for him to include that in his video and what him and his friends saw shouldve stayed private or at the least cut it out.
Who els say the video I saw it im NOT making fun but R.I.P
Fuck all you gays
Why they keep calling him paul
Parents please please!!! Pay attention to what your kids are watching!
And I thought Jake Paul was done.
But *_nope._*
Of course not.
Guys they said followers you mean subcribers
Don't fire Logan Paul plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Apologies dont work for a such stupid thing that you recorded and posted on YouTube even tho I loved Logan paul I really dont forgive at all because lets say that guy was related to you and you see him in YouTube and that is just disrespectful for any of us
hope he ban in YouTube,  he is not a good influence for the young generation..
EXPOSED 2018
This is all of You-Tube's doing. I hope You-Tube will get massive shit from everywhere! You Tube shits on creativity, it is time for You Tube to get what it deserves. Maybe this way they will learn to not do favoritism for money anymore. And Logan Paul should be fucking exiled from public life.
*This is EXACTLY what he wanted to happen...*
Logan : *OH lemme just zoom in on this body*
Me: I was a loganster but ima a Jake pauler now. Sorry dude, but you disgusted me
Take away his endorsements!!!!!!!!!!!!! No more rich jerk
Abc news always give children away
Youtube wont do anything about this.  Hes the epitome of privileged.
agreed
+Pj Ferdinand That doesn't disprove what I said though. There are people who do both work hard and smart but still suffer the consequences for actions of a lesser degree as compared to what Logan did. My friend was one such person.
Rukia Kuchiki its not always about how hard you work its about how smart you work.
+Pj Ferdinand Yes, he is privileged. I've seen people work far harder than him in other professions, but got fired for doing things of a far lower severity.
not really privilege when he worked for what he has lol
https://youtu.be/eGtaotE_q_A 
The reupload
Magdalena l inform the you tube authorities of your "reupload"as a racial discrimination . Fuck you!
That moment abc needs to milk logan paul
YouTube is dumb. They didn't take down the video but took down the reuploads. And considering Logan put a dead body AND a young community it should have been taken down by Youtube.  It really shows us that YouTube only cares about big YouTubers like Logan Paul.
F*cking idiot... imagine a little kid going to watch his channel and seeing a dead body...
Suicide, Its nothings new, please
About time parents knew what shit their children watch.
His sponsors better fuckin retract too
Just leave him alone he put the video down so stop talking about it I know its upsetting but there are so many other people that did it when there so why him leave him alone I was upset to. Now everyone leave Logan alone just try to forget about it thank you 
oh really? like who? give me names. i mean pffft...there's just so many so you should be able to. and why him? because he's huge. has a huge influence. example YOU. can tell just by your username.
He said sorry. All of u guys make videos of him cause u want views. BITCH
He uploaded that video because he wanted views and making that apology video just made him still have those views you don't know anything.
I usually don't say things likes this, but I wish that man ill.
And I hope that his death is SLOW AND PAINFUL.
Sarah Barker omg yes 
He deserves it
The Paul brothers are sociopathic pieces of trash !!!!!
I dont get whats so bad because life is rated R not G.
I remember the good old days when 10 year olds on YouTube watched creators like DanTDM or someone like that. Now they watch the Paul's. Smh.
I remember the good ol days when there wasn't YouTube or Instagram. Oh has life changed.
Miss Aquamarine i fucking know right! Like how about the old cartoons like dexters lab, jonny bravo, powerpuf girls, an grim adventures. Nothing is the same anymore everything feels so fake nowadays.
Miss Aquamarine I HATEEE JAKE PAUL
Riley LifeIsNotOnFire I'm 11 I still watch him
The pauls are the most cancerous people on youtube. Their content is filled with stupidity and they get famous for it. It amazes me. Sad that alot of kids look up to them.
Lo-- Sike wow.
better than ghetto ass catch me out in the dirt bitch. look what she's doing to children but nobody cares fml.
I am personally a logangster, but Logan is kinda an idiot, he said there was kids running around the forest and yet he has kids watching that video..
Hate Logan Paul now and forever
Desecrating dead bodies is one of the rudest behaviors in Japan which is coming from Buddhist thoughts. Americans merely pay attention to other cultures.This is why I don't want Americans to come to my country.
He's always bothered me for some reason. And this fiasco justifies it now. I think he should be sent to a type of rehab facility where they can disconnect him from technology before he potentially harms himself. Although, he deserves intense criticism for this situation, he's another human being to think about. Him and his whole crew laughed and made themselves look like fools and disrespectful human beings on camera, the whole world can't unsee that now. He should just go somewhere and fix himself first before any more apology statements surface, they won't solve anything. Also, YouTube should've stopped the video from being posted in the first place and censor it.
why didn't they do that to gumrice when he made fun of that girl
I would've watched his video but I'd have to bleach my eyes after getting check for ear cancer i almost got ear cancer from hearing him in this I'm on my way to get checked for cancer right now
When it gets posted on the news, you know this shits real
He was just on Top Chef.  And now to find out what kind of person he is. Horrible
Maverick for life 
Well my parents watched the news today and watched this too.. No more YouTube for me... God damn it
ppl make mistakes it's not like anyone has ever made a mistake in their lives maybe ppl are saying this bc they HATE logan
at least he said sorry don't make this as if it is a big deal
No one said he/she has never made a mistake.Logan made that video to get views and money and he did that on purpose.
The whole everyone makes mistakes its a shit excuse and its like thats all you have to say
Valeria Iglesias So filming, laughing, and actually uploading and editing it to YouTube is a mistake? That is fucking disrespectful to the family of the dead body and he had all the time he needed to stop himself from doing it. That is more than a mistake.
He fucking laughed at the body... go to hell Logan Trash.
Primestista Coleus I am so moved that there is a gentle person just like you in America.
wheres thw video i wanna see. not once have i heard from this clown. put the video!! y im i even watching this shit
If yall hate him u should go to FaZe Rug he posts interesting vlogs and better
I hate how all news reports call subscribes followers
I Saw On TV! Then I Checked YouTube!
"A growing up expierince"! Give me a break .. he is a grown up man!!!
Munim Agha vlogs his apologies don't mean anything. he still exploited one of Japan's most gruesmome problems for views. and don't tell me it wasn't, because it was obvious he thought of the suicide awareness thing probably while writing the "apology". he needs punishment, not to have this just blow away like nothing
Just because hes grown up physically does not mean that he has grown up mentally
Munim Agha vlogs Logan clearly has brainwashed you like the rest of his fuckwit subscribers
Law2811 yeah maybe:/
Logan paul is a Twat.
DAMN, THIS SHIT WENT TO ABC........
Logan Paul is defiantly going to reach his downfall.
*He's obnoxious.*
Jake Paul is all over the news.
And ppl say Jake is retarded.
Well at one part we all liked Logan Paul..and don't we all make mistakes?! Like ppl at one part were gonna have to make this dumb shit history 
XxMCRainbowXx MsP Only people with rocks for brains like these two gaylord cunts
This was NOT a mistake! So what, when he edited the video and made the thumbnail and title to go along with it, was that a mistake too?
no. we all make mistakes.....we don't all 1. film a dead body. 2. think of money while filming a dead body by mentioning 'demonetization.' money is usually the last thing on our minds when finding a dead body. 3. make mention of CHILDREN COULD"VE SEEN THAT after filming a dead body that is potentially going on the internet for you know...everyone to see including CHILDREN. 4. edit the video of the dead body and put in little funny noises. 5. upload the video for allllllllll to see.
i want to see the video!!!!
He is a dummy because read the title is he stupid these Paul brothers are bad influense
How could anyone like this idiot?
My mom knows I watch him and she watches him with me she has np
Why do people look up to him, why defend him?
Notice Robin didn't say "bye, Felicia" over something really outrageous.
Be glad none of you skanks work in a hospital. I think you liberals would all have seizures after you heard the jokes from doctors, aids and nurses and about the deceased we have come through our place whether its by suicide, murder or natural death.
By the way, Ive never heard of this weirdo and hope he hangs himself in suicide forest along with all the other youtubers
Isn't anyone going to kill this person yet?
Audrey Popo l am thinking of informing Yakuza(Japanese mafia)of what he done.
See the part I dont understand is the fact that he said he did the video for suicide awareness however showing the body of someone who committed suicide is in no way helping people who are suicidal. When you are trying to raise awareness and to help people who are suicidal you dont show the dead body of someone you killed themselves that doesnt make sense. In fact if someone who is suicidal was to watch the video and see the dead body it is highly possible it could trigger them. And even if they dont see the dead body if they saw Logan and his friends reactions where they were laughing and making jokes (even if it was a coping mechanism) it could make them feel worthless and as if what they are experiencing is not serious. Although Logan did say that suicide isnt a joke in the video, his and his friends reactions however did not reflect that statement.
I know he put up warnings about the body and all Im just referring to the fact that his statement about doing the video for suicide awareness doesnt make sense because the people he is suppose to be targeting (people with mental issue and suicidal tendencies) would only be negatively impacted by the video thats all
Yeah no one likes sophie turner
Sorry
why is he on ABC MF NEWS???
he is an idiot, get him off of youtube
But, who (as a teen)  watches him?
Why da f*ck do u guys have to say it and now he is going to get a lot of hate I hate u guys
Um fired nope
0:50 BE GONE THOT
popular on the disney channel not on youtube? xDDDD
Yall were talking bad about Jake Paul and saying bad things about him now look at logan Paul Jake Paul hasnt done nothing this bad!!!!
Hes a Little Loser With a PC and a camera So he went there AND EVERYONE HATES HIM 
Like if Agree Also Subscribe to me I have 2 Subs
Good morning America sucks
OK I deleted my last comment I didn't know he went up close to it!!! I found video but black out!! That very disrespectful
Shane Dawson, where you at??
That b**ch
He should not be forgiven
komrad skeltal our forgiveness is not us condoning his actions or allowing him to be stupid forgiving him is personal and shouldn't affect his mistake
I think he doesn't deserve to be forgiven. He has caused drama only for views, refuses to act mature, and laughs about somebody being dead instead of keeping it private and not showing the body. Even worse is that YouTube didn't take down this video and Logan took it down himself. YouTube didn't bother to check the contents of the video, they just let him bring all the cash in and put it on trending. You really think a person should be forgiven for that? The fact that he even uploaded it in the first place proves he doesn't care about anything but money. He wasn't even honest in his apology. "I don't do it for views. I get views."
He's just YouTube's Golden Boy. All he cares about is cash, and so does YouTube.
Everyone gets a second chance OKAY
Lisa Wordlow This guy isn't a terrorist, just a plain, uneducated, and ignorant white boy.
He is sh*t f*ck Logan paul
His career is over he st*t
He is such a lil' STIT
lol this will pass
Lisa Wordlow the Logan will keep Logans channel up and it will keep growing.
It's none of your f****** business it's Logan Paul and YouTube's business because he's a part of YouTube and it's on YouTube and mind your own business
He's a lier and However his Apology Is Fake Honestly I HATE Logan Paul Because He's Offended Everyone With Issues Of Death.
Its not followers its subscribers
yall better not take his vidios offi love him
mick95 mick95 That joke only made you look more stupid.
ambs nicole same
ambs nicole Fuck you!! Racist bitch!
YouTube cant sensor tv news or their opinion about a-hole Logan Paul
Did anyone notice they said "15 mill followers on YouTube?
Can you please just get off his back
i hope he gets sued
ITS SUBSCRIBERS NOT FOLLOWER
"I didn't do it for views I did it because I thought i could make a positive ripple on the internet" nah he did it for the views he thought the video was going to be funny and rac up some views but he was wrong that's the real truth.
Logan totally made a mistake and as humans, everybody makes mistakes. However, he apologized to everyone watched the video which makes it fair enough. Also, by his mistake, he makes billions of people be aware of a series issue (Suicide) which nobody in the online has done it before that viral. In my opinion, Logan should be forgiven and be supported. There are a significant number of people (tweeting, uploading videos and so on) about Logan Paul should not be forgiven and then they talk about helping the people who are having depression but they do not know that might have a negative effect on Logan right now and it can lead him to the depression. (MOST of those people use Logan Paul mistake for clickbait to their videos). At the end, Im not defeating Logan Paul action but Im saying the FACT.
Honestly if news covered shit like this more and parents were informed about what their kids were watching, assholes like Jake and Logan would go down
Ok so just because people hat he said sorry
All youtubers with a large followings just do it for views. No questions asked
Well, most of them
What a smug asshole, "I didn't do it for views, I get views".
How do people like him and his friends make it out of there without some demons??
Give him a break it was a mistake
He shouldn't be posting that crap, just delete it and tell the police!!!
mick95 mick95 sorry
steve velasquez  Fuck you racist! I don't  want Americans to come to Japan. Most of them are so rude to Japanese people.
Pewdiepie makes more money an has the broken record of most subscribers than this POS
DISGUSTING! I hope I'll never have to see his face again and YouTube deletes his channel forever and for always.
You are a compassionate woman.  you must not be a American.
https://youtu.be/o0DRdDbnPW8
https://youtu.be/cVW9N3WLskc wow!!!!! wtf
Wtf if he is gonna be removed mostly the logangs are gonna get mad the logang are fighting for him he is already sorry about it mostly everyone in the world loves him then there just gonna remove he's channel
Fu Logan Paul you suck balls
STOP BRINGING THIS BACK UP 
Is this fuck a Jewish?
apparent no. it happened. theres proof. fucking hell.
Shut the fuck uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
damn even on abc
Also the video wasn't even up for 24 hours he deleted it after about 10 hours or so
Actually he showed the body but not the face he blurred the face out
Guinevere Scott doesn't make it any better. This is just proving how naive you fans are, and how you can't comprehend how bad it is.
hey!! #LoganPaul, YOU ARE SCREWED!
Logan Paul exposed good riddancenow we need SML exposed
hbo endorsed him? God
Yall stop getting so freaking offended by this. I bet yall are offended by the movie the forest which is about the suicide forest
Hated him since day 1
In the video Brenden says get the camera and lets go some people think that he meant lets go and film the body but I think he meant lets get out of here Just what Im thinking
Wanna know what was REALLY sick about his video? Him and his friends were SMILING when they found the video. "Awareness" my ass. They looked like they found the frickin' jackpot to get more views. It's disgusting.
Park ChimMin Indeed. I feel like parents need to keep a closer eye on their children, and they also gotta realize that this prick is whats turning their children into filthy brats!
Gamekid1254 I know. Its sad. I wonder what their parents think of them? The guy that they look up to is a bad influence.
You know, it genuinely pisses me off how EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HIS FANS who are young children/tweens dont understand anything about respecting the dead and good old fashioned common sense. This is really what 7-13 year olds call entertainment? This is why our current generation of children is  fucking trash. >:/
Gamekid1254 It's obviously not, if it was a mistake, he would've stopped recording and immediately call the authorities. He would've STAYED AWAY FROM THE BODY INSTEAD OF SHOVING A HIS DAMN CAMERA IN FRONT OF IT. Did he? No he did not.
And people in the comment section are calling this a mistake or an accident. Smfh...
I HATE LOGAN PAUL HATERS!!!!!! LOGANG4LIFE
LOGANG4LIFE IM NOT BRIAN WASHED
Patricia Dwyer are you that brainwashed?
JY DUDE
Patricia Dwyer dumbass
ABC news leave Logan alone this was not meant to be shared he obviously made a mistake and apologized for it by taking down the video and making a video saying sorry. This should not have been on the news. Like if you agree. I'm not saying I think Logan should have keep the video or anything like that but just leave him alone.
Sry but I dont have a big deal about this death is death it happened its done
You to day new stop judging people on the firs part of video and wach the the hole video and than say something just dont do stupid stuff like judging peopl for the first part of a video you are person I would not show this stupid video to
blah blah blah logan is still cool go grab the hates and stick it up your ass
Can't you guys find it in your hearts to forgive him u guys are just as bad as he is if u guys are going to make a joke out of him
Dick head.
When did he post the video?
Omg hes not getting fricken fired I forgive him 100%
Brooke And Emily  are you retarded? You see a corpse and laugh? WTF is wrong with you? "Oops he ded lets laugh and take some close  ups, meybe even not feel bad about him or his family, im sure they are alright"
Brooke And Emily just because you forgive him doesnt mean the dead guys family forgives him,and everyone else on YouTube.
I dont have Twitter because whats the point everything that happens on Twitter gets said on YouTube
Fuck all the people who is being made to him he is a good person he just fucking up everyone do the same thing
He is dickhead, no one in their right mind would get up close to a body like that, film it, make jokes and laugh, edit and post the video with a thumbnail of a dead body for views.
Laloxxf21 Look who's talking, a fat fuck who is wearing dog ears and fake hair as a profile
OMG LEAVE THE GUY ALONE HE MADE ONE MISTAKE AND HE GETS IT. HE KNOWS IT WAS WRONG HE IS YOUNG. HE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THAT SITUATION SO HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO I FEEL SO BAD FOR HIM......
EDIT - I've been looking at all the replies I've been getting...... U guys are right he is a bad person..... He should go to jail...... I don't feel bad for him anymore
He was laughing at that poor man's corpse and making jokes. What a silly mistake, I'm sure we will all be laughing about this one in a few months.
Jade Wolf not being hostile or anything, but I dont think it can be called a mistake
Jade Wolf he had all the time in the world about thinking to post that video. Common sense to not post a dead guys corpse on YouTube even if there are children watching.
Let a black person do this u wouldnt hear the end of it
0:30 TO 0:40 DID SHE SAY HE HAS   15MILILON followers on YouTube
zdg123 Gill followers. subs. its all the same tbh
PLEASE don't call me stupid , dumb or anything but what does under fire mean?
All of these news channels aim for key points that others use
*His got 15 million followers on YouTube*
ITS 15 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS
The guy is 22 years old and made a mistake. Everybody makes a mistake. You dont have to forgive now or never but weve all made HUUUUGE mistakes at that time and he made his. I aint defending anyone but putting that out there
Lel..even the news is on it
Jesus Logan Paul!!!!!! All my friends ask me why I dont like him and I told him why because of this!!!
OMG LET IT GO PEOPLE THIS IS STUPID 
ITS SUBSCRIBERS NOT FOLLOWERS    
you really are big big debil
What idea made him think that it was a good idea to film a dead ass man who committed suicide, like that shit isnt okay. I wouldnt be surprised if he loses a hella lot of Subscribers
Stop saying allegedly. He did find a dead body
Omg Logan Paul said sorry and now this should be over. So pls stop being such an idiot people.
Good shit this dude is annoying, waste of sperm
Omg:'(...people if you truly love logan and support him.dont stop believing in him.he needs us logangers,to show him..we love him.that we care..don't let this get to you.its an outrage..full love for logan paul...
Logan Paul posts controversial video 
YouTube: *I sleep*
People criticize him
YouTube: *REAL SHIT!?*
News talks about him
YouTube: *ASCENDED*
I love Logan Paul
True that ^
*Sighs* I remember back when kids on YouTube used to watch DanTDM and CaptainSparklez and shit like that, not the fucking Paul brothers.
jessalyn barrera orellana I hope you get A LOT of help for this
EVERY BODY MAKES A MISTAKE STOP making a big deal even logan said him self in the vlog that suicide isent a joke and talk to his fans about getting help or anything so he is also helping people and giving them a reson to not cumint suicide and I think that Logan should be forgiven. He feels so bad about what happen he even feels bad him self logan is now sad and dosent deserve to be sad in the new year. PLZ FORGIVE LOGAN WHAT ELSE DO THE NEWS WANTS FROM HIM???(*this is my opinion*)
Just like we have seen it before, Logan Paul's internet career has hit the giant ice berg and he will unfortunately not be able to recover from this. His days of the entertainment business are over.
Trash!!!!!
He is still my favorite youtuber
Once a maverick always a maverick and i believe him
_"I didn't do it for views. I get views."_ Jesus Christ, the _pure, unadulterated ego_ he has. Why do kids like him again?
Stop the hate on him Everyone makes mistakes
YouTube is not going to allow that. They pretty much get all of their money from the  paul's asses. They aren't going to stop either because they want to stay rich.
Let him stop making videos, then maybe the hate will stop.
Good normal people don't purposefully seek out place known for suicides and laugh about a dead body. That is a disgusting choice made by a disgusting ladder climbing monster. I feel very sorry that kids nowadays make it their mission to defend monsters instead of focusing on becoming a better kinder person
Disrespecting the dead and editing/uploading a video of it is a mistake? Lolololol, okay then.
I also drive a 250,000 vehicle called the Jester in Grand Theft Auto 5
Outraged over a suicide n suicide mountain.  Lol fucking snowflake outrage
Ok now i know logan did something bad but how aaron paul said go rot in hell like your almost telling him to go die like thats bad thing to say especially when who create suicide kill them-self because   Of that
1:41 BULLSHIT
I do agree with he shouldn't never put video up
"He has 15 million 'followers' on YouTube."
I wish he would delete his channel
He was a victim of suicide, not an apparent victim, this is why people call you fake news ABC.
Well, 2018 Is Off to A Fantastic Start
This guy and his fans that are defending him are idiots.
Stop hating on Logan, plus people say why you get off the trail Logan of corse you would find something going off trail like a dead body and I say f*ck u yes he made a mistake but give him a break
"Victime"
Everyone is posting and talking about this in their channel for views. THIS IS GETTING ON MY NERVES. STTTOOOOPPPP PLZ
0:33 what
The Paul brothers are the most worthless human beings I've ever seen
I used to watch Logan Paul. I looked up to him cause I thought " Wow! He's so cool! Wow! He's so funny!" I thought he was such a great inspiration. But he did what he did, and we should never forgive him for that. Not only did he laugh at the fact that a man was so overcome with depression, or mental illness, or whatever that man experienced,that he committed suicide, he continued vlogging and got loud, freaking out that he never thought he would stumble across a dead man. That is a complete lie. He did research on the place to know exactly where he was going to go, he knew that hundreds and thousands of people commit suicide in that forest, EVRY SINGE YEAR. He knew he was going to find  SOMETHING, OR SOMEBODY dead in there, and he used what he found as "clickbait". His title being " found a dead body in the suicide forest" or whatever. He used that DEAD MAN as clickbait. Sure, he took down the video, sure, he made a video apologizing, but the video was just over one minute and a half. Is that REALLY an apology? An apology would have been him apologizing to the dead man and his family, donating money for suicide prevention, and that's not even hard, considering the money he has. He didn't even put in mind that there are little kids out there that are allowed to just pull out a device and go on social media. Did he even think that there were kids that would see him laughing at the fact that the man committed suicide, and changed the way the kids thought, because the parents don't know what is on social media these days, they don't know what kids are seeing, and they aren't there to say, "No. That's not okay." So just imagine the day when those kids grow up, and what their minds are thinking. Then, we can look back and thank Logan Paul. Thank him for being such a " great "role model. Thank him for being " such a great entertainer"...
Logan Paul fans dont even know what real entertainment is. Theyre also calling his actions a mistake or an accident. Lmfao.
I just came on to watch some quality YouTube and guess I haven't been on in a little. So look what pops up on trending. I need to keep up on the my Logan Paul drama.
Thanks main stream media for getting parents to realize there kids are watching this
I watch him
You all suck
You all suck
Alright fuck these SOABs too
People are you high who wants to kill them selfs wtf
He did nothing wrong why is everyone freaking out? If someone kills themselves who gives two handfuls of shit?!? This world is filling up with pathetic snowflake cucks toughen up snowflakes before you kill yourselves
Vincenzo Coccotti is this a joke? First  of all, he did do something wrong. If you don't think he did, then you are either too naive or too stupid to comprehend it. And if someone kills themselves I'm pretty sure the persons family and friends would care. And this shows how like Logan, you are dense and heartless and only care about your self. Is it hard to be that pathetic? Just wondering
FOX NEWS be like
YouTube star kills innocent man in suicide forest japan
Please stop he deleted the video and apologized.STOP NOW
If y'all really get mad over this shit. What do you think will find in an YouTube video that'll show a suicide forest. Ofc there's people that has dead body all over.
0:34 its not followers its subscribers!
Minnie Mouse same thing
Im honestly NOT mad at him
No- it was not something I was happy about seeing; but its my opinion:
Honestly people are overreacting I think
He apologised and not only is the video extremely exaggerated; he DID intend to raise awareness of suicide! He laughed because he was nervous, People are saying he said things he didnt say- I am a little disappointed at..
the fact this has caused so much drama over my favourite youtuber.
my inspiration.
Umbreon IKR? btw love your channel 
UmbreonTube I didn't call you obnoxious, I called him obnoxious. You're just naive
Im a teenager and not a child. I dont need to be called obnoxious for my opinion. Not even a child should.
UmbreonTube oh my gosh. You seriously cannot be this pathetic of a person, but you are a Paul fan, so it's not surprising. People didn't overreact, they reacted the right amount. And if he was trying to raise awareness for suicide, that's not the way to do it. He's a selfish, obnoxious, prick only in it for the views. You kids are so naive and really, really need to stop defending him.
A growing experience?! Okay... stupid morning shows...
Jake Paul makes wants to have cancer
He obviously did it for the views, don't tell me these adults are as stupid as the fans
Hes an idiot
Great. Another YouTuber giving all the good YouTubers a bad name.
Well he also says f## a lot so that's were your kids learn that
Leave Logan alone
What triggers me most is that he sorta laughed at the dead body. If he wanted to raise awareness he could've donated but he ends up going to a place where depressed people go to take their lives. His apology was very, very fake. SUICIDE IS NOT A JOKE.
C`mon at least it wasn't clickbait like am i right guys
So... I have never heard of this guy until today. Is that good?
Solgeon Solray yes very good
I ignored the video because I thought it was clickbait (sad) then later my friend says it's all over twitter I was like shit
ok i know some people are going to lash out at me for saying this and tbh idc, but people are SUUUPPPPEERRR overeacting in my opinion, i mean sure its not the coolest thing to post a video showing a freakin' dead body but come on dudes it was a mistake, he apologized! just let it gooooo dude
I never liked his chanel or his brother
I am glad pewdiepie dont get juged
He is 22 he still dose not know what he is doing he is still growing as an adult but he said sorry so u guys need to chill pleas
Why do they not seem at all sad or effected by this? They're just as sick as Logan honestly.
I think he was laughing nervously. It was an accident, cmon everyone makes mistakes
Chris Stilling i like Logan but I think after an argument I agree with u
Chris Stilling anyway ik what Logan did was wrong. Have a good day
Chris Stilling and he wasn't making a joke about it. He was making jokes but not about the person
Chris Stilling but it was an accident. Ik what he did was disrespectful but when I watched the videos he only showed the body for 2 seconds then put the camera facing his face
Chris Stilling Well at least he covered the face right? And sorry for our lost
Great. Now my little brother is dismissing his disgusting behaviour and saying it wasn't his fault. Someone get the soap and educational videos!
at least the Paul bros are in this together
All he wants in veiws
stop being mean you son of a bitch. every I dont does not know what hs means to us please please stoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppppppp
Yeah Logan it's never happend on YouTube, but that's because most people have common human decency.
Your trash
I hate you news your just a depressing video Logang for life
HE DIDN'T KNOW HE LATER DEEPLY APOLOGIZED THAT HES. A NICE GUY AND HES ALSO A SOMETIMES GOOD INFLUENCE 
Your the one not letting him try to live because he siad sorry
I'm honestly am not siding with anyone cause I never watched jake or logan but shouldn't parents teach their kids what to watch and what not to watch
What has he done wrong?
Finally his career is deteriorating!
Lol he should have a death sentence with a last meal on video
You can tell these guys dont know shit considering he is saying 15 million followers instead of subscribers shit I like Logan and his videos but what he did what flat out retarded
For god sake get over it!
Logan Paul is a terrible person hes famous but why he doesnt deserve to be famous at all the way he acted when the guy commited suicide though  like he says it's to rase awareness but he is just making it for the money he is a dicusting and horrible person that doesn't deserve anything
BUT NO ONE KNOWS IF IT'S FAKEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
SO MANY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS
0:34 oh the cringe. Followers on YouTube?
Sinc. Sinx
Literally just saw a kid comment "it's just a dead body, who cares?" These kids are just as bad as Logan.
Anum Bloodrose Same.
meatball99 omg ikr 
Look how's he's corrupted them 
It's absolutely disgusting
I've lost faith in humanity because of people like him n people who follow even after this
People like the news are making home feel bad
A fresh start for 2018 i guess........
Hahaha this is funny he got his ass in trouble with fans
Every one makes mistakes!! Y'all in the comments stfu you made a mistake you probably regret. U (hopefully) learned from the mistake u made and so will he.
im just wondering; what does Logan have to do for you to NOT forgive him? Kill someone? Live stream himself raping his dog? You all seem to have set the line too far, whatever he does he can be forgiven as long as he says sorry. Believe it or not, but you can be a fan of someone and STILL disagree with their actions and call them out for it.
80% off abortions for children up to    22 years of age! Call now and say Darth Reaper sent you!
It's not a mistake, it was a choice that he made to upload that video. It was a choice he made to use that picture as a thumbnail. No, no mistake!
An apology doesn't fix or undo what he's done. He doesn't understand and he's clearly not learning that his actions have consequences. Regardless of who he is and how much money he makes. Us real people in the real world, if we even tried to attempt to do this, youtube would take the video down immediately. But cos he's such a big youtuber and big thing, his channel isn't taken down, and he's still being paid. We need youtubers like Daz Games to be bigger. Not such a disgrace like Logan Paul.
lol the apology was him humble bragging
MOVIMIENTO NARANJA!
Its nice to know that the news is covering this instead of ANYTHING else.
Hope they Kill his Channel and he loses a boat load of money and has to work for a living.
i agree with Mr Zman
can everyone pleas stop arguing
btw im the person who usually makes conversations worse, so please stop saying stuff like Logan should die
Tim Palmer shut up you loser i hope you join the people in the suicide forest
Oak I hope you die
Tim Palmer 
Mmm thts why i like Jake Paul better cuz is a tiny bit mature cuz bruh why u laugh at a dead body especially when someone sucide themselves like really logan really!
theyre both the same idiots
Jake Paul makes thumbnails INAPPROPRIATE for young viewers. Please explain how he is more mature...
You mean subscriber's
I still dont see how he was raising awarness for suicide
Apparent
I saw this on TV this morning. 
It is NOT called the "Suicide Forest". It is Aokigahara Forest. Stop painting the same picture Logan Paul did.
"I didn't do it for the views."~Lied the youtuber
Omg get over it he put disclaimers and said sorry and deleted the video
He broke the guidelines. He was making a terrible apology.
If someone repsonds, they get a guideline strike!
Please remove Logan Shit-stain Paul from the internet along with his fuckwit brother.
Fuck off kid. jealous? Im fucking glad its not as bad in Australia. Is that what Logan has taught you? When he shows a fucking dead corpse in his "happy" vlog, and people say its wrong, you say "haters are jealous" and "dab on them haters". You make me sick
Elkin Shiner please
XxLoisxX MSP Are you kidding? Nobody is jealous about recording a dead body, idiot.
There is more videos like this on youtube, I don't get the backlash. The forest should be closed anyway.
Elkin Shiner and if they take Asian jake paul with them I wouldnt mind
THE FUCKEN US PRESIDENT DOES WORSE SHIT AND PEOPLE STILL SUPPORT HIM ....... WE ARE ALL HUMANS AND MAKE MISTAKES... NO ONE IS PERFECT, MOVE ON PEOPLE...
What?
2018 already becoming a terrible year and it just started smh 
GIGGITY! I hate Logan Paul but its what he did that was terrible
Mnlight bae_24 manchester= inside job
Mnlight bae_24 WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THIS IS A GOOD THING! NOW MORE PEOPLE HATE LOGAN PAUL! LOL!
Dear Japanese People: 
You have every right to be mad. I completely understand you talking shit. However, Logan Paul is the definition of a trashy, loud, and disrespectful american. WE ARE NOT ALL LIKE THIS I PROMISE. I swear that most of us are good people. Don't take this guy as a representation of America please.
They said 15 million "followers" on YouTube
I was trying to raise awareness for suicide 
*Uses body as thumbnail*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-INI3CIuh0
I don' think what the heck is the problem i'm actually a lo gang i'm like 12 yrs old and i don't see whats the problem, he shoots a video of a dead person then people says take it off so he shown respect so he took it off and then he shoots another video saying sorry, but next day comes by and people are re uploading it and sharing it to the people....he can obliviously go to jail if you are an lo gang then you might not be able to see him and i hate the news so much that every time when logan does something wrong apologizes the news people starts to tell what happen and i know it is serious but if you are a logang then you should stop re-uploading things...
Ok I know what he did was bad but as a     Human being ever one makes mistakes in there life and it's not about what you did to make that mistake happened it is how you handle it and what you do to make the situation better and what he did was apologize he know what he did was wrong and that is so inspiring to me
HOLD THIS L LOGAN
IT ISNT FOLLOWERS ITS SUBSCRIBERS
This is why I unsubscribed to him.
First of all its not his falt becaouse why would who would have the idead of inventing a suacide forest if it bad and people are saying sont do it then why would they creat that type of forest
I hate him simply for wearing that stupid hat while going to a forest where depressed people have KILLED themselves. He obviously didnt take this depressing place very seriously, hes disgusting.
So Disrespectful it's sickening
Everyone's pissed because they think that death doesn't happen in the real world (well it does !)
como cerrar la boca ya
Logan Paul is such a twat
i still like logan paul and im only 9
Ooh they are so ooh let him be Logan  is so cool
Even if you like him and try to defend him he did do something that was disturbing, but I'm not saying anyone's wrong. So no hate.
Addpocolypse 3.0 is here
Thankssssssss
The only way he can apologize is by deleting his channel and stop being a bad influence to millions of people (notably children)
"Targeted at teens and children"
teens and children
teens
Wtf nigga only kids under 12 watch that son of a bitch
Stop supporting this man. Hes a sicko.
Think about it, people have made much much much worse mistakes than this. There have been people who have done the same or worse, and not been talked about so harshly. So why does Logan deserve to be criticized more than anyone else who has done the same or worse. Logan does not deserve to have all the criticism put on his shoulders. No one deserves this no matter what they do. So before you talk shit about him and his video think about if this was you in the same situation that would make you feel very good would it. No it wouldnt it would make anyone feel good. And I know Logan is very strong about the haters know what that mentally does some damage. And Logan was trying to warn people about what actually happens in the real world. Logan was not trying to offend anyone, so you all need to get your freaking act straight and grow up.
If you just close this forest we will save so many people or place ninja police  (swat)  so that they will stop this disaster
....who writes an apology with an emoji
Waiting for a Content Cop!
They Forgot to say: Leeeets get riiiiide in to the news :D
How is that awareness if he was laughing...?

*@LoganPaul* New Year new you?
Logang 4 life
aannnnddd keemstar's idea has been fulfilled
Logan Paul's video post reaction:
Well, first off I don't believe he that he didn't do it for the views. Yes I know he gets views and obviously so does the world but he probably only did it for more viewers and subscribers than he already has. There may be a chance that he did it to have an positive affect but with the world being as it is it wouldn't be a positive one. People now a days are more "depressed" and "sensitive" than they would be if it wouldn't be for people like Logan. 
Even I know that pele know are different and I'm just a kid and Logan's been to more places and seen more people than I ever will, so that would mean Logan is a self centred uncaring brat or he just don't pay attention. 
Either way it still isn't the thing to do. When someone takes there life .... Well,it probably wasn't something Logan saw everyday. And they way he reacted to it wasn't the mature one. If someone has so many problems and is that broken in life to commit suicide then when they do do that it shouldn't be something everyone sees. People should respect the dead, in this case not only is the person dead but their death was on their on account. The message he was putting out there and the message he said he was portraying are very different. 
This was a disgusting act. An act that millions of viewers saw. Viewers that are not even over  the age of 10 saw and even people over that age was affected. And not in a good way, like Logan said he did. If the viewers (or people that know what happened) aren't offended or disgusted. Then they are just as childish and awful as Logan.
As soon as you type *logan paul* you will see ,all over the web spreading with the suicide in japan ..this is crazy
"My kids like to hate watch him". That's exactly what I do he an idiot I don't know why kids like him so much
Content cop: Logan Paul. Coming soon on Youtube 2018.
His apology is so fake. He even said in the video that them going there was "supposed to be a joke"
They said followers Instead of subscribers...WHAT THE FU -
How can anyone defend this person who lacks the most basic common sense?
Do not bring him on your show. That will just encourage him
Grow up people
Oh my. his career is over.
I got goosebumps. Idk now
Omfg, I remember I had a vision in my dream about this video like 7 months ago and once I saw the video, the vision came back to me
alyssa osuna precognitive dreams I think? I had those kinds of dreams way too much lol xD
1:34 Finally another paul attacking a paul.. i feel appalled
This is the first meme of 2018
He's stupid his career is dead and gone
This Logan Paul bloke is an utter twat.
Wow 15 million followers on YouTube and there I was thinking they were subscribers. Silly me
Logan Paul is sick he should really go to mental health because he did this all I got to say is karma
I fucking love this kid but damn he messed up

Just stop
Finally Mainstream media is exposing this fuck now parents can forbid their kids from watching the Paul brothers

This guy is a fucking goof
NEW YEAR STARTS!

Logan Paul: HOLD MY BEER
Pickle Rick ha! good one
Don't sugarcoat the fucken truth
What a lusty piece of shit.
Omg why give him this publicity
STOP PLEASE YOU ARE RUINING HIS LIFE WITH ALL OF THE DRAMA
 It's every day low with that suicide flow. Filmed a hanging Japanese man, never done before. He just ruined his whole career, and his lil bro is next 
Wow this whole thing is spreading
Logan plays: the victim card
Cant believe he did this,  Im not following him on YouTube anymore.
he truly dented the universe this time.
I wish you all a happy new year 2018
Disrespectful fucker
The kid is a Spritually bankrupt money lover Satanist who will do anything for mammon. Why is anyone surprised? If nobody complained he wouldn't have said squat in apology. The remorse is influenced by his fear of losing revenue. PERIOD!
acting like s**** to Logan Paul because you don't have to be like that why don't you be more respectful to him he's trying to apologize to you and if you don't like him then don't be a logang because and if you don't like him don't be one okay cuz I am trying to apologize cuz I accept it and you guys are just acting like s**** like you don't care and like that's what I hate about other people being s**** cuz that's going to happen to you when you grow up dicks
You're all so dumb. He did something really disrespectful. That was not a mistake stop defending him
Valeria Iglesias I know but people make mistake you don't know that because if you make a mistake what would you do bicth
Daniela Molina it's not like anyone has ever made a mistake in their lives before 
geez he apologized
What about the graveyard? Its that ok ...
I HATE when everyone says  Well he has 15M little kids watching his videos because its the kids parents fault. They should be supervising what their kids are watching.
I didnt even see you body tbh
Lawsuit is coming
You shouldn't ban him from YouTube he has so many fans and they might get mad
Alisa Violet And?
Welp I don't care I'm a HUGE FAN  so stfu
Who is the real culprit who caused that? He or she is still free and can happen again!
I kinda fell bad for Logan but he knows what he did
Logan and Jake Paul suck as a YouTuber and they will never be as good as my favorite YouTuber jacksepticeye
Wtf is this?Everyone makes mistakes
Not defending him - really do not have any amount of care for this situation. It's foolish from an objective standpoint, but generalizations have been shown to lead us towards the downfall of humanity. Just want to bring awareness to Pseudobulbar Affect (emotional incontinence). Not saying he has it, but it is a possibility. Don't give into the fundamental attribution errors that most people fall into based off to the comfortable feeling that they possess when they believe they know why someone did something. No one knows. This kid probably doesn't even know. But if anyone has PBA , they would know that the world would rather judge you than ask questions or wonder. Sad.
He doesn't need this hate so if I was you stop
I know he did not know how to respond
and whatcha gonna do if we don't stop hmm?
MR ZG2004 he filmed a dead body! He doesnt deserve the hate stfu kid. He deserves every bit of hate he gets from this.
His career is still in suicide forest
I hate this Logan still hasn't uploaded yet and he might of stopped YouTube so I would just want everybody to stop posting videos about this 
It's making things Way worse
Jessica, CoconutCrazyGames yeah
Logan upload the video to win more viewers
"ALLEGEDLY" FUCKING ABC. THERE WAS EVIDENCE. DUMBASS JOURNALIST.
Boooooo this
HES UNDER FIRE BECAUSE HES GOT THE HOTTEST MERCH IN THE GAME!
He was acting like his brother
RIP logan paul
Why couldn't it have been jake Paul
Daddies Play toy **** you it should have been no one
Daddies Play toy because he seems a bit smarter then his brother.
Amazing Phil96 oof end ur self
Daddies Play toy Im a logang Pauler so stfu
He is not a star. He is a blot.
I smell bullshit.
Fuck the pauls
Wait this is real? I thought it was a parody
People are acting like this is such a big deal do you no how many other dead body videos there are and they dont even blur the face at least logan did that and as i see it he did a good thing by calling the cops and now the family can have a funeral for him
what are u all doing in life
Holy shit Its trending The suicide forest is trending holy shit
my mom does know i am watching him and she even subscribed to him
Oh no a dead body everybody go nuts
$350,000 vehicle***

Yall need to stop talking about Logan he is fine

Please sign this petition!
You can't trust YouTube just as much as you can't trust TV...seriously.  Parents.  Monitor.  So many young, young kids all around the world saw a real, fresh, hanging, dead body for the first time on his videos.  It makes my stomach churn.  My heart breaks for the victim, the family, and the friends, having their hurting loved one disrespected and shown like that in front of the entire internet after their passing, after they were in so much agony that they took their own life.
Why is there even a suicide forest  has to be super eerie
his channel should be deleted.
Im 10!! I love him!!! Ill watch him NO MATTER WHAT!!
Why is everyone so mad like he was just trying to help people who are dealing with depression
what kind of actual brain numbing shit are you on?
Just choked on the stupidity of your comment
EmranTube7 laughing about the problem is the best, right? And you really think that he really apologized? He didnt, he said it so you retards follow him still.
Darth Reaper Hope you can recover
tsuyu asui Thanks
He did it because he didnt want another person to take their life!!!
Logan Paul is the best, i love him so much
He's loving the attention from this
Oh boy another YouTuber making mainstream outrage. Time for adpocalypse 3.0
Dafaq? He's 22??? I was going to give him the benefit of the doubt thinking he was like 17 or something but 22??? What is happening to the world .-.
Mad Respect to Logan Paul! He had the balls to do this! only cowardly pansies kill themselves or complain about trivial things.
Coming from someone who's an Overwatch Cringetard, I'll take that as a compliment.
Eduardo Rivas you should have been aborted so the human race could have had a better chance at evolving
Logan is stupid
I'm never being logang again......I'm watching Jake Paul now
Logang for life
Chris Stilling I understand that was a very disrespectful thing to do that was a big mistake on his part but everyone makes mistakes
He should be shut down off making Videos Period. I do not buy his trying to make awareness.  We are "AWARE" of the Very Sad  truth that people from young to old are killing themselves. That was a Life.  It SHOULD NOT have been so very disrespected to use for views. Hoping action is seriously taken about this.
I'm so glad i've never actually watched any of the Paul brothers' content
Watch my reaction to the Logan Paul video on my channel
or watch my parody interview with Donald Trump that I just uploaded here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fSzmNmWW6Q
If he belived what he was doing was right.. why did he take the video down? So people would forgive him and he could get back to money and veiws
a douchebag, how such a stupid person can get so famous, it's bad for society
Youtube "star"? That would imply that he is relevant.
yet liveleak does this on a daily basis.....
u mean subs
Honestly i think there making this a little bit of a big deal becuase it is not that bad honestly he thought he was doing a good thing hes human he can make a mistake for crying out loud
Wtf why is that cen doll lookin ass even popular ?
ITS FUCKING ANNOYING HOW THEY TURN THIS SHIT INTO SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE NEVER KNEW ABOUT 
SO IF UR KID GETS CAUGHT SEEING PORN U BLAME THE PORN STARS NO U BLAME UR KID IF U DONT WANT UR KID SEEING SOMETHING THEN TAKE THEIR PHONE AWAY OR SUPERVISE THEM BETTER
F you logan im not watching your videos any more also im unsubcribing from your channel get lost and go to HELL YOU STUPID DEMON
Abc news stop talking because you don't know anything about him.stop getting involved in shit u don't belong
What a great thing in the first week of the new year
Nice to hear that he apologized, that he realized that it was horrible what he did
PFFFT 
Honestly his apology was crap, any idiot could see that there are other ways to prevent suicide and raise awareness
Um it's not his fault there is youtube for kids
ABC correct your self, he didnt allegedly do it, he *DID* do it.
I think the news should fuck off I don't support paul but no one needs a another adpocalypse
Lol she said followers its subscribers this will make you feel old
They said followers it is subscribers
I am in the logang and I know what she did was wrong but the logang support to know what no matter what he does so if anyone is mad at him I'm going to your face and you hear me ok he made a mistake we all do even really big ones if anyone tries like threatening him light threats are there going to be in big trouble
"I intended it to raise interest in suicide preven-" 
No, you intended to make money
Allegedly
Don't know why this idiot is more popular than Exploring with Josh. Exploring with Josh, he has a passion and great respect the culture he is visiting as well as the place.
Schnaider nineseveneight very much so. Exploring with Josh is more of a documentary show. He has such passion and respect for every place he goes to.
Yeah exploring with Josh is also awesome. Dark haunted places 4EVER
Never heard of this Logan Paul child nor watched his video. But if you weren't doing it for views Logan you'd never have filmed the death and posted it in the first place. The only reason he is apologizing is because he covering his backside to keep endorsements and viewers. Pathetic youtuber!
We only been in 2018 for 3 days and its like 2017 all over again
Give a likel who feel bad for logan?
Social suicide. Good going Logan Paul zitface 
Raise awareness but you were laughing and making fun of the situation.
THE TEA IS SO HOT
SPILL IT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSTmB6pa1Go&t=3s
Way toooooo start the new year...tbh not surprised....
Well he had 15 million
How is he sorry??, he mocked a dead man, and on this APOLOGY video and he didnt turn off the one thing that gives him money for views, the very least he can do is donate to a suicide prevention program but he thinks were going to let him of the hook for him just saying sorry, ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDSSSS, you claim you cope with things by laughing which some people do but you still insisted to post the damn video, look Im barley 15 about to turn 16 in March but I even have common sense if I see a deceased man I wouldnt even want to let other people to see what I saw, especially little kids and just cause you blur somewhat of the mans body you still can he him there hanging, are you not traumatize by what you have seen??, and how dare you let your camera man even get a close up of the mans face and you allow the it to remain on the video,and claimed you didnt do it for views but you put the poor soul on the you thumbnail for everyone in the world to see it and click on it, honestly Im surprised that your channel hasnt been removed because if it was any other YouTube channel with little subs there channel would be gone, but you and your brother are YouTubes money crops, but I mean it is what it is, this entire world is f**ked with that I wish you no pity from other people in response to this incident
Bunch of sensitive bitches
Im disgusted. He knows kids watch his channel. It makes kids scared and upset and it makes parents angry and concerned. Im in disbelief. Hes a fool. Disgusting.
Death is natural
The idiots that still think he does no wrong are the spawn of the same idiots that think Trump does no wrong!
How tf are you going to get in trouble ???
Logan sucks 
Wait, Aaron Paul?
Everyone is making Logan Paul sound absolutely horrible people have to realize that he is human and everyone makes mistakes and he did apologize.
Wow i can just tell this year is going to be shit
His video was NOT monetized.
Youtube should shut him down for good, Did he ever give one thought to this persons family? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO and it was all about money I hope his family files a law suit and I hope they win.. Why did he ever think he had a right to do this?? YOU HAVE TO BE SICK TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT....
He even dresses like a prick
HAHAHAH HOHOHOHO HEHEHEH HIHIHIHI
He is not "HOT WATER" he's now "COLD, DEATH COLD WATER". Ok that is just dump.
"I did it for a positive ripple"
Bitch you didn't even know you were going to find a dead body - you didn't do it for a positive ripple
You knew ahead of time you'd filmed a dead body - as suggested by a supposed tweet along the lines of "Tomorrow's vlog is going to be the craziest and most real" - and in no way "In the heat of the moment" over-sightedly posted a dead body - which you had in the thumbnail, title, etc.
There is no "positive" here.
Your opening was completely ruined by keeping the disrespectful footage in the vlog and thumbnail.
AND THEN.
You Met some of your Japanese Fans.
Who were young, and they're your "fans" they're likely to see your vlog. - They don't need to "don't go in that forest" or whatever you said.
They're going to see you go in and disrespect someone.
uggh.
YouTube needs to chill out. He put a disclaimer at the beginning of the video, listed the suicide numbers, but YouTube doesn't even fucking age restrict it! It's their fault for reviewing it and saying it is okay for children to watch. But he did laugh and I do agree it is very disrespectful. How could he make a joke about this? Ugh.
Bringing this to parents really is going to kill his career smh
Fuck LGan Paul he doesn't care about no one
1st of all, the title is as fucked up as it sounds that makes the Paulers the assholes. 2nd of all, you all know big YouTubers like that fucker do videos for clickbait to attract viewers which still makes them assholes. You guys believe everything you hear and see. 
And lastly, if most of you hated Jake Paul and Logan Paul, you idiots wouldn't be making memes of him that make you look like supporters. If they were that hated, they would not be gaining subscribers. If anything, I have a feeling that some people pretend to hate just to make shit trend.
But, yeah. Logan Paul and Jake Paul are still both assholes regardless.
just delete the video but when people talk about it they will be able to fin the repost of that video so talking about it makes it worse and i dont like that.
This is what kids are watching, an asshole who exploits suicide for views. His brother exploited Hurricane Irma for views. The Paul Brothers are both horrible people.
stooooooooooop making stupid people famous -_-
Wait, wait, wait.
His intentions were to raise awareness for suicide? Did he ever, EVER in the video say something like "guys, if you're feeling suicidal please call a hotline" or anything of that nature? You know? The thing literally ever (sane) YouTuber has ever done when they make a video on a touchy topic? Intentions my ass.
Diamond Dog he did say that in the video. But the hotline actually made a statement that what Logan Paul did was not helpful to prevent suicides.
Wow, this is why you should always know what your kids are watching....
Look at the amount of people who have gone to the them forests they didnt get any hate so just forgive him
They are not posting videos with an ACTUAL BODY IN IT. While going in the forest was wrong in the first place they at least had some respect not to show a body UNLIKE THIS FUCKER.
Virtuitous Vampire preach
callum mcivor amount of people??? They arent all putting dead bodies on YouTube and using it as their thumbnail. And so your excuse is because someone else did a horrible thing that makes it ok?!? Get some morals and self respect. You cant think for yourself so you follow a shallow idiot to make excuses for his behavior! Get a life!!
Allegedly???? Bitch said ALLEGEDLY???? What do you mean he DID show it
2 days into 2018 and this happens
Who watched the vid before it was taken down?
Did she just call "subscribers" "followers"? Gosh... 0:33 - 0:36
I don't blame her do...
Its heartbreaking. Him and his friends continuously laughed at that person. Imagine being tortured and laughed at in life, and that following you in death
Logan
Erik Nagasaki ikr but sometimes
Is a dumbass
Omg no
He said sorry
Caylee Simmoms yeah and then reuploaded the video to make more money! Now he is making 3x more off a dead body!
lul nearly 2mil views. Most viewed video on channel. gimme gimme
"Growing Up experience"
He' not sorry about what he posted. He's just sorry for the reaction he got.
Hes a kid what do you expect from him every one makes mistakes
Fake News shit up please
Its not a big problem
Come on guys its logan paul the king o clickbait and thanks to all this fucking kids around the world made this cancer famous and he make money by you guys he do it for the views
Check my latest video I expose Logan Paul for faking part of the controversial japan vlog

Petition to get Logan Paul off YouTube !!! Sign It!!!
To all who are calling him an idiot isn't helping. What would help is that Japan monitor that area to the highest degree to keep people from going there to take their lives. Ive heard of that place and if anything it's time people know of it and it be monitored by the Japanese authorities better and help the people who seek to take their lives there. Help them!
Sophia Yates you cant monitor an open forest and their is also bridges in Japan that people also jump off to commit suicide that are monitored too!! You cant prevent someone dead set on taking their own life. It starts much sooner then that!
Because his birthday was 401 so, 
deadbody332=401+529+612+806+824+1102+302+...etc they make page to truth
Allegedly lmao the receipts dont lie!!!! Logan Paul is proven GARBAGE, nothing alleged about it
Sarah Samuels wow me 2 we are like the same  except u r a rat
Sarah Samuels  at I don't care about this but LolololollOoLlLoL
They have to use the word "allegedly" for legal reasons. Even if it's obvious. Lol
logang4life *sue and *birth ugh i love educating todays youth!
Link10883 i feel sorry for you and your ignorance.
He fucked up WE GET IT. The video didn't hurt anyone did it? Just move on and if you don't like him, DON'T WATCH HIM.
Everyone hating on him thinks they are right, but do they not understand that calling someone stupid or an idiot does not make the situation better
so thats how my parents found out about this....
I liked that video
Honestly I never liked Logan Paul or Jake paul
How would you know what's best for children anyways? You people drag every Youtuber to the ground and take all the money for yourselves by making parents and Youtube think only you can be trusted when you've been exploiting families for generations with your bullshit
My kids say they like to hate watch him. Same George, same.
YES FINALLY LOGAN PAUL IS DYING.ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME
There are worse things on YouTube than this. Come on now
Apparent suicide victim are you fucking joking? Does that look apparent?? There WAS a dead body in that video not APPARENTLY
And so it begins......
Wow, its making mainstream news too huh.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro1Uz0Yr5ZY
Brinnge back Logan paule
The positive side people can't see it. He's intention was to give a message to his followers about depression. Well, well, well.
U know its a problem u see jake paul was getting roasted on for months and Logan stepped up for him a few times now that logan did soemthing it apears on the news and jake paul didnt say anything about it like if it was my brother i would of atleast stucked up for him
What an idiot.
I can't believe YouTube didn't take the video down
unicorn love and he reuploaded it now too!
2018 is off to a great start!
Logan Paul said he was sorry and he took the video down I forgive him I hope everybody else can too
austin braham so why did he just reuploaded it??? Dumbass!
Here in America we don't talk about real news noo we talk about a YouTuber that made a mistake
He wouldn't freaking post the video if it was a 'mistake'.
Olius AS hey bro we don't need all that, calm down a bit.
Not a mistake, he knew what he was doing  he created the thumb nail,cut and edit video(so he knew exactly what was in there) and then uploaded it. He thought it get views. Oh wait nevermind I forgot "he gets views"
mistake my ass stop trying to stick up for this man child
ihack U its not a mistake if he did it on purpose because he could willingly that was never a mistake
ABC Is fake news.
Such a punchable face.
Well done YouTube you done it agent can we get a round of Palors for youtube
You know come to think of it this video was potentially uploaded to get all this backlash and to get notoriety on every major news channel there is. Lol
This man has no respect for the ones who have a lost their lives! And he has no shame
+Sooshi Cream don't turn on him now whites been doing this. you anit God who the fuck are you to play it. i don't see you addressing the lyhning of blacks in your country that happen last month
Sooshi Cream this guy still has not apologized for every other fucked up things he has done
zioro1235 jackasses will always be jackasses. they give not a fuck about ur feelings
Sooshi Cream or brother and sister. or friend, or anyone you care about too.
zioro1235 you are very young and you obviously don't understand the severity of this whole situation and how tragic and horrific Logan's actions really were. No amount of crying and apologizing will fix what he has done. He has exploited a human body online for millions to see immediately after the suicide victim has lived through the darkest moment in his/her life. That is absolutely unforgivable and anyone who does forgive this sociopath should be ashamed. I wonder if your reaction would be different if it were your mother or father hanging from that tree and being bullied by Logan after death?
That forest tho a movie
LOLOLOLOLOLOL MY CHILDREN LIKE YO HATE WATCH HIM AHAHAHAAHAHAAHA I SCREAMED
WTH, he did not do it to raise awareness for suicide, he was joking about a guy killing himself!!
I don't get why he would laugh at a dead body. And said he would raise awareness about suicide. Reply to me what you guys think.
Karma~
Content Cop - Logan Paul
Finally parents are actually aware of this cancer
Content Cop : Logan Paul ...Make it happen you lazy fucks!!!
There are thousands of videos online of dead people. What's so different about this one?  Kids who have/had access to that video have access to the thousands of other videos which showed dead people
He barley said anything im not a logan fan but wow u guys just iver react to anything and everything
He did not do it to spread awareness...he straight up laughed and giggled when they found the body and while they were recording...
Jaris J i forget anyone involved in the vlog was just as responsible. logan paul the cause of their misbehavior
Even if that's the case he still shouldn't have laughed at all. Especially if it was becuse his freinds were being awkward while seeing a dead body
Jaris J  he didn't laugh at the body he laughed at the awkwardness of his friends
Jaris J ikr absolutely disgusting
Im just a boy who watch it...
Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not Sub to my channel cuz why not

Yayyyyyy you don't get abc news in england and mauritius
Any publicity is a good publicity
Logan is in trouble.
He's an idiot with no real talent.
Rainbow Butterfly  no his not
#SAVEYTFROMTHISDUDE
#STOPLOGANPAUL
congrats to logan paul singlehandedly ruin 2018 hands down
Im goin to KFC, anyone want anything?
Why r people hating 
If he didnt do it for views then WHY DID HE POST THE VIDEO?? There are other ways you can help prevent suicide but filming a dead body and posting it on the internet for everyone even kids to see wont help prevent it, It might make it worse because a lot of people, especially kids look up to Logan Paul
Im reporting every Paul video and disliking , join the movement
Think about how dumb it is to walk into a suicide forest, seeing a dead body and think its a prank so much that you keep recording because if its not a prank, fuck it still gonna upload.
did u watch it or even his other vlogs prior
Zaza Jarrell I know that the but someone said said he thought it was a prank even though he knew he was going into a suicide forest.
YVG Im here, joining in
He regrets being a disrespectful ass now
STOP HATING ON LOGAN PAUL OK!
Virtuitous Vampire why don't u leave Logan alone if u hate him don't watch his vids block him
Maria Maldonado fuck off and get some self respect! You would follow the devil into hell!
Who ever hates on Logan has to hate on me Logan just did it for his vlogs ok so stop hating this is proof in a logangster for Life
"I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention." Yeah like bringing a football and joking about the ghosts in the forest is so helpful. What intention did Jake Paul make the video for is not suicide. Just the attention and views. And when backlash happens, he's on his knees looking for forgiveness because he didn't get the praise he thought he "deserved". So sick that there is people like this who rub this on the new generation. Just stop Logan. There will be no more continuing in your career, because we are pretty sure it's dead.
Logang for life
Please be kidding
Imagine that dead body was a part of your family. if you still said logang for life youre retarted
b8ted lmao
Jeremy Murillo good shit guys keep telling kids to take their lives, love the positivity
You're like 12
What a piece of shit. I can't stand this loser. Why is he even famous? Vine? His vines were absolute trash...  should be banned off of YouTube
Now all faking youtubers make video on him for view getting more view it,s mistake
Douchebags like this deserve a place in hell because they're ruining and polluting the minds of the young people on this planet and we wonder why it's going to crap.
Hes a fucking idiot . Ban Logan Paul from YouTube !!!
Bro other people react to everything different even said he would hen he doesn't know what to do he laughes
He put I get views he showed go to jail or court.
That is why I am glad that my kids don't watch this fool. Can you imagine how many children he exposed to the close-ups? Plus, the jokes and laughter next to the poor man. He makes me scared for the future of our youth.
zadma Im not old. Im 21 which means i am younger than your precious gaylord and by your logic he is older than me so he is a fool.
Just Life. He is not a fool old people like u are fools
DragonTech Reviews considering he said hey bro you alive. Yeah he was cracking jokes about him. An intelligent person would have known he was dead considering  the location and what it is known for.
And have u even seen the real video? He never fucking joked about the dead man. Smh
Who said your children have to watch him he swears and shit
*WHY ARE YOU GUYS GIVING HIM MORE ATTENTION*
Hella Slapz so maybe the parents will stop their kids from watching this fool!
Look people logan Paul did not mean to do that. Really, stop criticizing him for what he did. We all do mistakes because we are all humans. So stop doing that. Thanks. And logang for life.
The issue is not that there is bad stuff on YouTube, the issue is that Logan Paul, the guy with no talent and 10 million subs went into a Suicide forest hoping to find a body, laughed at it, recorded it and uploaded it for 10 year old girls to be scarred for life.
People who are saying abt his deleted vlog hasn't even seen others videos on YouTube.. And yeaaa #logang4life
He had the time to edit the footage he uploaded, and he still has the nerve to upload that part of the clip. Hell, his editors even debated about it and the fucker uploaded it anyways
Go criticize tfil he posted a video on the suicide forest
If you guys criticize him for the forest then he is mot the only one who went to the forest
*he is only 22* bitch wtf
You mean subscribers not followers
Damn he was on the top now he's so hated
ABC is reporting this shit? Fucking giving him more views?
If Logan didnt know that his Video was wrong, then he must be REALLY dumb. 
Logan is just plain pathetic.
"I did it to bring awareness to suicide" my ass. What a fucking Liar.
And everyone on the Longang; you can like him If you want but it doesnt change that what he did was wrong. 
He is a bad idol for kids. 
And you kids and teenagers whatsoever who defend him for this Video, Im disappointed with you all. You know that his Video is wrong. You know that he will never be truly thankful to his "Logang" because you defended, or gave  Money to him through Views and Abos. 
He says "Thanks" but everyone can lie. 
Well, I hope you kids realize someday that you are wrong in protecting him.
Stoooopppp itttt!!!!
Leave him aloneeeee 
Just passed Logan's grave
This guy isn't welcome in our community, he's trash.
Go back to Disney
Good God how stupid can you be to do such a thing like this. No common sense at all
Youtube should ban this guy for life.....
Sponsors should withdraw themselves....
What a fucking scumbag....
the media is talking about it, finally parents can be aware of this dude's danger.
*Oh nO PeWDiEPie saId thE n-woRd*
Logan Paul showed a dead body. Hmm
What is a supervine? Like 8 seconds long instead of 6/7.
paul?!?
I got the video but Im scared to post it
So it takes Logan paul fuck up for everyone to now give a shit about suicide awareness lol ridiculous
He's fucked up
This is why I dont pick a Pauler side.
Markiplier has more sub's than him...
yeah sure, awareness of suicide laughing at a dead man, whatever Logan...
This is what America has become. ... No respect for anyone. His channel on YouTube need to be taken down.  .  why make a mockery of someone that committed suicide?? This is suppose to be funny????  I am apalled! Who are the stupid assholes that endorsed this ignorant guy??  His apology was so self serving. No feelings at all!
I really hope his young fan base stops admiring this moron, he is such a negative role model
^^^ Stfu, lolol
And you are positive? Because?
That dude is fucking annoying  fucking idiot cant stand this goofy fuck
Wow the heat gets worse every night. What a great may to start 2018
30000$
3000$
Both Jake & Logan are pricks
Omg he done this to raise awareness my brother at 16 took his own life and seeing that video made me realized how much the happens I thought it was like winning a lottery but Logan is a rly cool dude and cares for his fans he doesn't deserve of this hate he he demonized his own video! People saying he made fun of a dead body he did not the way he copes with stuff like that is by laughing u can't judge someone by watching a 10 min video like the saying don't judge a book by its cover also he's the decent Paul brother he didn't sing everyday bro
until  this  day, I never  knew  who  this  IDIOT  was and I wished  I didn't.
Your biggest mistake just destroyed your career. You have no heart you joke smiled drank Saluki and stupid statements well lesson learned at 22 you need to grow up show compassion (no your laughter was just cruel ) bye wish you well but Im glad that your ignorance will be gone
What a fuckin loser
HE STILL HAS THOSE BRAINWASHED 10 YEAR OLD SAYING * OMG LOGAN PAUL DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG DAB ON THEM HATERS* PURE BULLSHIT MATE
Suga_. xo.! His fans not him apparently u can't read mate (^-^)
Destiney _888 Right these kids can't be fixed
+zioro1235 Over 6 million people saw a close up of the body and most were kids and they probably won't be able to unsee that and you think sorry will simply fix that? That's not how it works in the real world.
EernyX  he said sorry mate mate he was crying when they saw the body and crying in a video when he said so sorry so stop picking on him.
Schnaider nineseveneight
 stfu
Stop it stop talking about him!! My parents know that I watch him I'm gonna dislike you guys also make mistakes right SO WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE TALKES ABOUT YOU NO HE ALREADY APOLOGIZED SO STOP DOING IT
Wow this is geting HUGE its now on tv Oml logan your in biiiiiiig trouble srry lol
Now he's going down the same drain the "Disney Channel Flow" went
+Gracie Dlugosh The "Same" idiot
Jake Paul made that song this is logan
Titan Playz I think Logan Paul is innocent, I made a video explaining why on my channel, check it out and actually hear me out I made some fair points
Samy LK Boi........ -_-
Trust me hes not going down he even gained more subscribers 
*I am one of the 6 million people who saw the disturbing footage of the dead man on Logan Pauls vlog. I just want to write this message so people have an understanding of what actually occurred. 
Logan Paul was laughing because people react to uncomfortable situations differently. It was an uncomfortable situation and he did not know how to react so he laughed in disturbance. 
Some people cry in times of disturbance, some people laugh in disturbance, and some people react differently to disturbance. 
Yes, what he did was wrong, but he is human too and he shouldnt deserve to be harshly criticized for a mistake because, as we all know, humans make mistakes. 
The main concept which we should all take out of this is people react to uncomfortable and disturbances differently and that humans do make mistakes. 
Please spread the word of this message, I just want to raise awareness to those who are lacking the understanding of what went on in his video. *
Jacob Powell this was so far from a mistake. He went into the forest on purpose, knowing it was forbidden, he went off the trails on purpose, he FILMED THE CORPSE on purpose, even fucking zoomed in on it. He approved the video on purpose and uploaded it, knowing its content. He didnt know this man, he showed blatant disrespect to him and his family and even his fucking apology was self-centred and douche-esque.
Jacob Powell  good job that helps
Jacob Powell most people understand that humor was likely a coping mechanism. Thats not why theyre angry. Theyre angry because of him going to a place called Suicide Forest in the first place, seeing a what he assumed to be a dead body and walking over to it for filming it, and for keeping that part of the video in the first place.
I would've done the exact same thing as him actually 
I would've laughed it off because I don't have the emotional experience of how to handle that
But yes it should've been edited out
hello I think he had good intentions, and it definitely was nervous laughter, but the fact that he didn't cut out the body was very inconsiderate, disrespectful, and done with poor judgement on his part. He didn't do it for money though, I'm sure. He has money and missing money from 1 vlog wouldn't have killed him. I think the possible repercussions of this just sailed over his head and he posted it without fully taking it in.
What is wrong with him why would you post it I do not like him no more
"I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention". Yes, because giggling at a dead body is a positive thing to do. If you wanted to raise awareness, then you shouldve just made a video, not in the suicide forest, about how people feeling suicidal can get help. Instead, 6 million people found out that person died, before that persons family even found out.
I will fuck up anybody who talks about shit about logan I will cut there throats and throw them in a pit of spikes no one dare speak anything about him  logannnnng for life

#LOGANG4LIFE #LOGANG #BE A MAVERICK #LOGAN PAUL VLOGS I LOVE TO WATCH LOGAN PAUL VLOGS HE IS THE BEST YOUTUBER ON YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw this news story in times square
Logang need to see this
Nice way to start the New Years
frikin IDIOTTTRT
Never been interested in watching any of his videos. Just click bait. Maybe he should try a real job like the rest of us.
"I don't need views, I get views" such a self-absorbed thing to say especially after a situation like this.  You Logan Paul, are the douchelord
Armagan Sengl lol
Ryshan Ryy Exactly!
Armagan Sengl honest of what? He said he get views by clickbaiting, doing immature stupid things, bad songs, drama and all these fake donating or helping people.
He was honest at least!
P-Gotti he's flexing
That dude needs some serious mental health help
First Jake Paul now Logan Paul wtf is going on in this world
OHHHHHHHHH HE DEAD HE HELLA DEAD
NEVER GOIN TO JAPAN
Im tromatizeddddddd..... i been on this forest..
stop giving credits to this stupid douchebag
You need to stop doing this
Omg logan I think u done goofed but tbh shit happens and I would have reacted the same  way give the guy a break
Omg logan I think u done goofed but tbh shit happens and I would have reacted the same  way give the guy a break
Logan Paul is cancelled
no he never said "pretty sure this has never happend" he really said "hopefully this has never happenend before"like come on u cant just miss out one word.
So what the big deal...
Well you just fed him fame
He can say whatever he wants,there's no other point in a persons posting of a video if it isn't for views. It damn sure wasn't to raise awareness of suicide prevention bc he made it into a joke.
The news??!?
Suicide is like the worst thing you could do to your body and yourself and that is so sad that there's a forest where many people do suicide
Eden Wright people in japan also jump off bridges and buildings. Unfortunately, it has some cultural acceptance even though japan is trying to stop it and raise awareness and put prevention measures in place.
i hate him
Is that a dude or a lady in the purple top
So BBC shows dead body's everyday and no one cares
Nathan Le but they dont laugh at bodies and exploit mental illness. Most times they dont even show the footage they have. Their are tons of video for 9/11 that will never see the light of day because they want to respect the victims.
My channel has it
Logang for life
That apology's so bullshit. He probably didn't even come up with it himself.
This thing is going around everywhere
Schnaider nineseveneight ikr
... and now for our next story. There was a bombing in syria (proceeds to show hundreds of dead bodies).
Why dont people get mad at the news? 
Its just a dead body, get over it.
Pluto : but the news doesnt laugh at bodies. They take it seriously! Plus they are not exploiting those bodies to gain viewership. They also make sure they dont show anything explicit or peoples faces.
This is on adc to omg
Disliked all his videos with 6 accounts and told everyone I know to do the same. 
Pewds says a racial slur, and gets cut from EVERY endorsement he has. I hope the same is done for Logan for his offensive acts. Yeah yeah we make mistakes, but this wasnt a live stream. This required set up,  filming, editing, posting and clickbaiting. And it is not an honest mistake.
I am so happy that this got news coverage on a real news station because this deserves more attention. Logan Paul should not have posted that video; But he did and now he has to pay for his actions
Anthony Ramirez the news channels show dead bodies all the time.
He is a sum
Fucking idiot
Yeah just trying to be positive, thats why you and your dumbass friends were chuckling and cracking jokes....
*If it wasnt for Logan Pauls Video*. I would still have been skeptical about the history in Suicide Forrest. His video just confirmed the stories are true... 
anybody could have reacted the same way to a stranger dead body the walk upon. 
-IT WAS NEVER HIS INTENTION, HIM FAKING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE THAN CAPTURING THE REAL THING
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
U FREAKING LIARS HE DIDNT SHOW THE BODY HE BLURED IT GOSH
Alghala Alamri but he was being disrespectful to that person and their family. He even reuploaded after apologizing. Hes an insincere narcisist that has no self respect and only wants to make money by shocking people! Thats perverted and sick to even do that to little kids!
If I had a hit list or if it was legal to kill, Logan and Jake Paul would just be the first two.
HAHAHAH Fuck you Logan Paul
Aaron Paul said at the end "Suicide is not a joke" then he says "Go rot in hell." Which implies that Logan should die.
You might call it karma
end is near
He couldve at least had some humility to admit that he was wrong after he apologised n after he explained himself, I feel like that apology message wasnt good enough
Elizabeth Chan especially when he reuploaded the video.
Big deal get over it
Logan paul stupid
Everyone needs to get over it and grow the fuck up...what did you think was going to happen when he went in there!!! LOGANG 4 LIFE
LOGANG EVERYBODYYYYYY????
Fuck logang
He may be getting a lot of hate, but hes now making twice as much 
Ashley D. 3x... first video of dead body, apology and now reuploaded! I guess hes a marketing genius! SMH
Not suprised
Not suprised
NO LONGAN NOOOO
I mean think about if someone you cared about(mom, dad, siblings, best friend, etc) killed themselves and then someone filmed their body and put it on the internet... How would you feel? It may not seem like a big deal but think about if it was you, or your loved one...
Publicity stunt at its best. Dude, we see dead bodies here all of the time on the streets in Los Angeles, California. Man who cares ? You guys are making a big deal about nothing. Ten years from now no one will not even care about this Logan charecter. Please. Next !!!!!
Virtuitous Vampire No one is saying that his childish immature behavior is ok. But no one really cares. We see dead bodies here on the streets here in Los Angeles, CA all of the timd. His behavior is inexscusable. But in reality us normal working folks with kids have more important things to focus on.
Sharjjahn Aziz so that makes it right?! Bad things happen so if other bad things happen thats ok too? Thats the most stupid excuse!
I dont like logan paul but he did nothing wrong.
Screaming Zebra If someone in your family died and then someone laughed at their body while taking a video and then posted it on YouTube that makes it Right?!?! Your disgusting to think he did nothing wrong!
Hes fucking disgusting. Why GOD WHY is he famous. Hes so fucked
Just shut the fuck up your just making things worse leave him alone the whole world doesn't need to know this it's not like someone not important dies and I just say oh I don't know this person lets make a video about this and tell the whole that he's dying yes I like his content it's good but just leave him alone please 
*Give him a second chance however is reading this* *If you have watched him for many years you would know that she is crying inside!* *Dont be mean this was never ment to happen* *Accept him for who he is.*

Who really gives a shit ?
"He's only 22" he's an adult not a child don't make excuses for him 
Japanese people are posting how much they want him to leave and they don't want foreigners like him in their country.
@Atiq R YOU fuck off, Japanese hater.
since when did this turn into a depression thing? logan paul trying to save his ass from the hate. fucked u, im not getting fooled
Andrew Daugherity you are an idiot. He basically danced on his grave.
Atiq R Aw. Angry ugly Korean who hates Japanese. What a classy comment.
Wtf are you talking about? He did not mean it, hes trying to tell us what not to do? FUCKING HELL WHATS WRONG WITH YOU LOGANGS LIKE WTF ARE YALL CORRUPTED IN THE MIND LIKE FUCKING HELL HE ONLY TOLD YALL SUICIDE IS NOT THE ANSWER BUT YET HE MADE A JOKE AND POSTED A VIDEO WITH THE DEAD BODY IN IT HOW IS THAT LEARNING WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?
It's not his fault he wants people to stop taking their life's way from loved ones it is sad that people have to go through that...
#Logang4Life
What the heck happend to that guy!!!
AMMA BITCH NIGGA! LOOK AT ME~! 
#LOGAN4LIFE
#LOGAN4LIFE
People go there to die.   What's the problem?
"You may not know your kids watch this guy"
OK so that's who to blame, the parents. HOW THE FUCK DONT YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR KIDS ARE DOING?
HAHAHAHHAHA BLAMING PAUL FOR POSTING REAL SHIT.
good start 2018!
Hahaha
Janny De Boer that's what I was thinking
Janny De Boer ikr
Janny De Boer I agree
Haha same thing I thought
Many people said that his target audience are kids, but is posting a video of a dead body suitable for kids?! I DON'T THINK SO! It's clearly obvious that HE IS A TOTAL IDIOT AND A MORON! HE AND HIS FRIENDS LAUGHED WHEN THEY SAW THE BODY AND THEY RECORDED IT AND POST THE VIDEO AND HE WASN'T EVEN JOKING ABOUT THE TITLE! Kids, please stop watching that man's videos! I don't even understand why people liked him! In his new video, he apologised, but i don't recall he apologising to the victim's family but he seemed to only apologised to the people who watched the video. Stop defending him with excuses. If he didn't do it to get views, why did he even post the video at the first place? And when he got the bad reviews and hate, he deleted the video. He clearly wants attention from the public but with this kind of thing? He has just became the most disrespectful bastard i have ever known, and it's the same with those idiots that laughed and smiled with him when they saw the dead body. What he should've done when he saw the it, he should've stopped recording, call the police, and informed them about what he knows. But instead he posted the video, and now look what happened to him. He's got attention and the social media absolutely loves him! He deserves this and i don't regret saying this because i can't just sit by and do nothing so i'll just give my opinion about this and this is my opinion.
Everyone in the world goes OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU (YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD)
ShinyPikachu nani?
And some 10 year old kids are forgiving him im just.......wow......mind piuuuuu
Never could stand these two
Wow they didn't mention pewdiepies comment

So stupid. Can we arrest him??? Get him and his friends off the website
Where are the parents?? 
His subscriber count is actually going up since this incident. Smh.
because not everyone is stupid
bbc shows dead bodies every single day!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is it ok with you ?
he didn't laugh at him! it was a hysterical reaction of a man who first saw the dead. he didn't know how to react. As well as his friends with whom he was there. He did not showed the face, did not say who it was. He called people faced with similar problems to seek help. I know he meant good. But people only see his smile which for them means only one thing. I'd like to see them if they saw the same thing at the moment when they are fun and easy on the soul.
Eve Luntern but they dont laugh over their bodies and show their faces. Nor do they exploit bodies to gain viewership. They show news, not entertainment!
I told my dad about this (he knows I like Logan Paul) , he said " all people are doing, are giving him more attention " 
*logan paul* its 2018 dont leave them dreams hanging  
Stop all the hate on Logan he didn't mean to have a dead body in his video he just wanted to camp in the forest. He is one of the top paid YouTuber. He is super nice and funny.
Virtuitous Vampire shut up
Cool Twins hes an idiot, a douche, a moron, disrespectful and egomaniac! Stop following the devil!
That selfish man chose to end his life in a public place for anyone to see. Why aren't we frustrated with him instead?? Fucking backwards ass people... smh..
A couple months back I said to my friend " hey at the start of 2018 Logan Paul will start the second adpocalypse" AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
How are people defending him saying  he didnt do it for the views he obviously
 did he put the poor mans body in the thumbnail (for views) and put  we found a dead body in the suicide forest ( for views) and zoomed in on parts of his body, it doesnt matter that he blurred the mans face out he shouldnt have recorded any part of that mans body he should have stopped recording like a decent human-being and called the police,and his apology is complete bullshit, how was this video supposed to talk about an important issue ( that being suicide) his psychotic ass laughed and mad jokes along with his friends at the fact that a man hanged himself  due to something that probably caused the man to feel so numb in life he had to go and take his life away to escape how he was feeling,I hate the fact that Im part of this generation where people support someone based on their popularity and how much money they have, not focusing at the sickening shit he does just for views and fame, he didnt make a mistake he knew that the thing he was going to run into most likely would be a dead corpse its called the suicide forest people obviously go there to unfortunately kill themselves, he continued to show the poor mans body and continued to laugh and joke about the body, that isnt a mistake thats just being nonhuman
I can't believe that after he did something so insensitive like that. He still gained 40,000 subscribers a day after this happened. SMH.
Keemstar did it better
This wouldn't have got as much hate or attention if it was a different person who filmed and uploaded it... fucking Stupid!
Lmfao
Logan get the fuck out japan!
Oh   No
You said  YouTube followers you a dumb BicTh stfu
Tbh Markiplier gets more views in 24 hours than Logan Paul
Oh logan u will better one day don't feel lonely humans make mistakes
I think me and my friends are the only teenagers here who doesn't watch or like Jake or Logan paul
Nah im in the same boat against these fuckboys
Finally! Someone who doesn't find their antics enjoyable
Thanks
Glad the humanity can be safe because people like u
Im in the logang
Virtuitous Vampire i am the devil
Pavel Golani keep following the devil!
You guys forgot to say that he made jokes about the dead body
#BANLOGANPAUL
I like how the reporter said he "allegedly" showed a dead body, when there is actually video footage (aka evidence) of him showing the body...
Whelp, there goes my hope for humanity.
Hes just 22 years old ??!?!!?!?!!?
The very least he couldve done was blurred the entire body but he shouldnt of posted that anyways. Why couldnt he of been a mature adult and realized this isnt suitable for most viewers especially with the age range of hes audience and how disrespectful it was.
He knew what he was doing.
The sad part was that he played everyone with the I wanted to raise awareness card. When even in the apology he states. "We didn't know how to react" then follows to horseplay and giggling and smiling while at the time filming the body in the background. I call BS and basic damage control. I'm sure while filming this... he had the opportunity to not upload and monetize. He did it for the views and for the headline on trending. As to being sincere about his faults ... I don't buy it at all....
This guy doesn't this over and over. 
Plus stop calling him a YouTuber call him a VineTuber. Because that is where came from originally. One more thing if you were raising awareness then you knew before hand what you were look at and what you might find in that forest. As the signs state to report findings and or incidents of suicide and states prevention at the entrance. You'd have to be soulless and ignorant to not do your checks and research before entering. Clearly again a false statement by this guy.
That is all....
Go to hell logan Paul
Not to be mean but whoever died got famous
Yo did you even wat h the video after seeing the body he goes on to talk about how suecied is not a joke and how hes there for them the logangang is here for them and there are people out there they can talk to.
Be a maverick
yoyo yax and be an idiot!
Should hang his platinum bitch blonde ass
This is upsetting
This guy shouldn't be important enough to be everywhere! Shame on the world. Especially the little kids.
Just shows how gross and distasteful people can be ,literally will just do anything for views and likes
Damn I would never think this would be on my news channel
He did nothing wrong
oook the dead body thing was over the top,but i got the positive side of it,he should of not recorded the body but the talk after it was en-lighting and good message.
He's SO ignorant.  This was not just a childish prank or silly commentary:  this was a terrible offence, a soulless, disgusting behaviour.  And then to make a pathetic, dishonest excuse for his moronic behaviour... something is very wrong with that guy.
The thing is. This will probably blow over in like a week (per usual) and everyone will forget about it....
This is bad I feel bad for Logan, he should of never done that. He messed up worse than his brother
Carly Whitehead the only reason u feel bad for him is bcuz he's rich and famous. Same reason you like him I bet.
Well his career was always fake. XD sooo
Theres many FCKING PEOPLE WHO POST DEAD PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE TOO WTF
Dariel Moran and so that makes it right?!? See evil, do evil!
F*** you logang for life
Im out of the Logang Im a jake pauler now bye bye Logan
Guys he is a human. People makes MISTAKES. JEEZ GUYS. Please dont be hating him. GUYS PEOPLE MAKES MISTAKES. #LOGANG4LIFE.
Lize 16 then why did he reuploaded it???!!!
The dude is an imbecil, ban his sorry ass from youtube.
He saved a kid lofe he gave poor people pizza he flew his fans to meet him idiots he is good
Virtuitous Vampire  but when his fans meet them some say he is bad like what you said and some say he is good he gives free merch to people and what I only want to say is that I agree with all people he did something wrong and he should be punished but not the way that people do people send him threat letters and make fun of him and many people went too far with this we all do mistakes and it was his first time seeing a dead body and he didnt know how to react but he did know his mistake and he appologized about it soo people should give him another chance what will you do if u made a big problem and all people started to hate u u will wish that people would give u a second chance ik he did wrong but he didnt mean it
american girl he does ANYTHING for views!!! But yet he terrorizes his Neighbours, his ex girlfriends all say he cheats on them with fans, exploits the twins and sends them packing, and treats the fans outside his place like shit!  Yeah he only shows you what you want to believe. Wolf in Sheeps clothing!
His ego is astounding. I hope he never has to suffer mentally as the poor man he found.
HAPPY 2018...
Forget about it
Guys he deleted the vid just stop this shit
manju rai then why did he reupload it!!!
Congratulations, you played yourself.
HumorlessComedy  LOL
HumorlessComedy 
Raise awareness of suicide prevention 
>> uses dead body as clickbait 
>> disrespectfully shows body to 15 million little kids 
*no ones gonna believe that excuse omg*
What he should have said was "ya wanna see a dead body?"
omg just fuck off.....ur using logang how used a dead body in his vid for views...but now ur also using it for views u dumb ass
He is saying ohno kids ate here what happends if the kids see the body   WELL logan what about the kids watching your channel HMMMMM
Oh damn logan paul is probaly gonna have little subs now after this DRAAMA
Logan Pauls career gone in 2018
*"....Positive ripple on the internet....."* ~his parent must be proud of him
Do we have anything else to do Jeeze hes not gona go down hes huge he makes millions and putting it on the news is not gona stop him
White privileged
So what if it was a mistake or not? Of the shame of it all! Oh, as the masses cry and wail.
Who picks and chooses what "we are supposed to get upset about", What we are supposed to be "offended" by? I have seen, and heard, far worse that no one says anything about. 
There are a bunch of instantaneous hypocrites out there. I used to be one of them, now, not so much. This is life now we social media everywhere, it's a different world than I grew up in, it's not going to change no matter how much people beat their chests, crawl up on the crosses and preach what they personally believe is right and moral. Why should he apologize, other than to retain subscribers?
leave this guy alone.
Who did he kill?
Thank you for your response.
Again, I am saying, how many things, far far worse than this kid, are done every day that no gives any care or concern about yet this video is causing an uproar? He showed a dead body? Poked fun at it? So he should have been caring, concerned, highlighting the plight of suicide in the Forrest and showing the body and that would be okay?
I have heard comedians say far worse things about death than Logan showing a video of suicide forest, a body hanging. I have seen far worse on television, Youtube, all that would give a person nightmares and it's okay.
There seems to a be a far reaching double standard as to what is "acceptable" "news worthy" "comedic" and what is "disgusting" "wrong" "Lacking morals"
I wonder how many people persecuting Logan have said, done, and watched things, events that are just as horrible or more yet he gets attacked. 
Why? Is Logan Paul supposed to be a role model? Who decides who is a role model and who isn't? Just because a person is famous, an actor, singer, dancer, politician, sports player, Youtuber, suddenly they are role models? Did they ask to be role models? Does the title role model just come with the being famous patch?
I am no condoning what he did. Is it sad? Yes. Is suicide a serious subject that desperately needs attention, particularly in this day and age? Absolutely. Personally I am not going to cast stones at Logan. This, hopefully, is a learning experience for him, and the world at large. Maybe he can do a video showing what subjects and people get attacked when just as many do not get attacked.
I can assure everyone that just as many people "enjoyed" Logan's video as are "disgusted" by it.
Pick you battles people.
This story, and others like it, are the major news event stories. There is a war going on.
Again, thank you
J Law so if someone kills on the internet everyone should kill because killing shouldnt be subjected to morals, respect or dignity! You live that life then dont be surprised when you die by the sword too!
Why does Logan say he didnt want to find the body but then says Im his apology that he wanted to raise awareness for suicide I mean I am assuming if he didnt mean to find it it would have been just a fun video or whatever so why would a fun video be to raise awareness?
What an idiot...
logan such a tool
I didnt watch that video 
Why do people even subscribe to him??? Can someone PLEASE answer my question!!
NBZ shock value
How can you have followers in YouTube you dumb ass news thinking you so trending.
Why on earth did he first go to forest
Craft me up to find a dead body!
messed up in the head is what they are fk them all he has to get banned from youtube
Its called suicide forest, what would he expect to witness, a unicorn?
AnMaMoMuSh RaNa I would actually be fine with it if it was someone huge like that lol. But everyone reacts to things different
Ana de la Pea Given there there is an average of 105 suicides in the forest a year the chances them self are extremely slim. Also taking into consideration that the forest is an extremely large forest and they could have wondered in any location brings down the chances a ton too. Im not defending him, hes obviously an idiot for doing that, but everybody makes mistakes.
and i am not defending him because he still made a huge mistake that shouldn't be forgiven.
but its not likely to see a dead person in an extremely large forest.
Ana de la Pea ik and he says suicide is not a joke but he keeps making jokes and laughing
But when you start laughing at the body, its a whole different story
Snake
What a great 2018 start. This is gonna be a shit year. Wont it.
Can tell who all the non suicide people are
When Logan Paul said that seeing a dead body at suicide forest never happened to anybody before. It has. Tfil    went to the suicide forest and found a body as well. But unlike Logan. They were mature about the situation and didnt disrespect anyone and hurt Anyones feelings.
This boy is a motherfucking dummy - Haha Davis
That reporter is hot 
Damn people be jealous
He actually gotten more subscribers because of this, that's how sick the world is.
I know right
Brian Crockett People are mostly retarded. For the win?
KaPowProduction Ugh, so many awful people..
Mr. Obvious The Fifth I was born after 2000 and I dont even watch these idiots
This guy is a douchebag! Dont understand why my nephew likes him. My kids are banned from watching him and still are!!
He just did all of this, all of this disgusting, disrespectful and shameless way to bring a topic as serious as this one just to get all this attention, now hes on everyones channels, on tv, Twitter. Thats basically what he was searching for
Logan your an idiot.
I'm not a fan of any youtubers, but I dont see the big deal, I maybe wouldn't have filmed the body but I would have filmed the rest of the video
Ggvfgbvf Pbgjbfh but he laughed at the persons dead body!! He was disrespectful to the culture of Japan and the family of the deceased person.
The shit white men get away with 
OMG people just LEAVE it. 2018 has just started and we are arguing about a VIDEO. He didnt know and yeah he shouldnt have done this but he is 23 and confused. He got rid of the video and people are just being DICK HEADS so stop
Leah Kielty he reuploaded the video! And now hes making money from his apology video and the new one. So hes making 3x more money off someones death. Not even giving money to the family or to a support charity to prevent suicides. Get some self respect and stop following the devil. Your sick!
WHAT WE DO HERE IS GO BACK.
I know tons of people dont give two fucks. But people act like they do.
The apologies are only to cover his ass.
How is it possible to have a dramatic intro to this video, with a thumbnail showing it, using the words "click bait" in the intro and STILL have a channel that You Tube allows???  He prefaces the video saying that no one has ever done this on you tube, ever!  It was degrading human life and sensationalizing death to children on this channel.  Where is the consequence to this?   How can the logan paul channel still exist?  Does not You Tube have any standards?
Whait not to be anhatet because i love tfil but they went to the suicide forrest en found a dead body sooo where is the story on that???
Nigga made the news 
It could have been your sister or brother. LOGAN BRAIN OF A TURD!!!!!!!
GET LOST FROM YOUTUBE LOGAN!
Jaclynglenn brought me here.
Logan Paul is actually as evil as Amon Gth who appears in Schindler's List
godblesslogan2018
I cant take him seriously with that hat  #Hi2018
Thats Logan retarded herpes motherfucker Paul hes an idiot and he should kill himself
First I've heard of this idiot.
Hes a disrespectful idiot and this deserves no sympathy.  Respect the dead and leave them be.  Hes 22 and he still acts this way?  Who he really needs to go apologize to is the Japanese people who he may have disrespected.
finally, mainstream media actually shining some light on how fucked up youtube is rn. hopefully logan will actually reap some real consequences rather than getting a shit ton of hate on twitter.
A "growing up" experience. He's 22, not 5
Stay classy Logan you dumbfuck
WHY IS YOU TUBE NOT SUSPENDING THIS ACCOUNT.  SO MANY CLICKS BY CHILDREN ON HIS CHANNEL.  A CHANNEL BY A MAN WHO LAUGHS BESIDE A DEAD BODY HANGING FROM A TREE, AND PREFACES THE VIDEO WITH A PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T SEE A VIDEO LIKE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE?!  C''MON YOU TUBE!!  WHERE ARE YOUR STANDARDS?!  MONEY OVER MODICUM OF DECENCY AND YOUR OWN STANDARDS?
No please no dont delete his channel everyone makes mistakes
Umm wow so many super long comments I will never read
Virtuitous Vampire Ik I do
shadow. com you have got the mind of a peanut!
It's insane he doesn't know what the problem is in that video  He will do more worse for his YouTube channel
I haven`t watched his video showing of a dead body, but his immature and insensible act is based upon his Schadenfreude. Some Youtube viewers also enjoyed his video with the same reason. Other people`s misfortune tastes like honey.  It`s true that Japan`s suicide rate is very high compared with other industrial nations, and Aokigahara forest at the foot of Mt. Fuji is quite notorious as "a suicide spot". Such place must seem bizarre to Westerners.
Wow.  The news knows best
Fuck the logang
Why would you quote him making a mark in YouTube history....!? What about how he reacted when he saw the body..
He making jokes about a dead body that's not normal that's just disrespectful and just did it for views and is disrespectful to the Japanese culture. He's also made a lot of racist remarks about Asians in the past I'm sorry but he is a horrible person and anyone supporting him is a blind moron but what can you expect from a pack of 12 year olds
ass mick adults watch him too. His channel is not focused on kids
he was "nervous" acting etc, but then he was making jokes and showing the body to little kids. what the fuck?
candice dix, he is a mistake
Eternal Gamer 2 why would he be suprised, confused, and scared he went off road he knew he wanted to see a dead body and show it on camera to get more views.
Oh drama! I luv it me bredda!
I agree people are being Cunt to Loganfor showing us real life
Daaaaaammnnnn
Haha 15 million followers! Is no such thing on YouTube only subscribers
that will be in youtube rewind 2018
Not even an week in 2018 and Logan Paul has already ruined it.
This shows that new years resolution is nothing but bullshit
this thing blew up crazy like fidget spinners
Who is one of The 6000000 People That Watched Him in the suicide forest like if you watched it me i watched it
Logan Paul is starting 2018 off right.
Orvei lol dat response tho
Emmy Norton hes joking dumbass
The heck? I bet even he would disagree with that.
Fck him
Youtube rewind 2018 - first clip: Logan Paul with a dead body
*Hey Logan Paul, Hillary lost the election, you can quit acting like her. Contributions keeps the socialist agenda alive...*
aka LOGAN RODHAM PAUL CLINTON.
Fuck you news
All the women could talk about is his money and his car. It doesn't help that they're black.
Yet youtube put that video on trending, there was no age restriction or demonetization. If i were to make a video about how Islamic terrorism is bad it would get taken down right away.
If Youre An Upcoming Artist Nice..Check Out My Page For Free Beats!
I find it disappointing that the young kids who watch him, mostly try to defend him by insulting really well developed reasons for why Logan Paul shouldn't be forgiven
They simply don't have arguments and points to at least make a decent comeback, so they just insult
Eternal Gamer 2 
As said previously, his apology is not sincere in the least. And even if it was sincere there is no reason to just 'get over it'. It's like saying a criminal should be forgotten about as soon as they say 'sorry'. Your logic is flawed, don't you realize you are backing up the original argument that Logan Paul's petty fans are defensive regardless.  
And what's with your insults? "You're just jealous cuz nobody likes you". That sounds like it's coming straight out of a little 8 year old that doesn't know any better. How could I ever be jealous of such a filthy excuse of a human being? I would rather have no one like me one bit than be a filthy rich famous bastard with fans like you. 
"I wasn't insulting" my ass, how do you not realize that the only thing the words coming out of your keyboard are doing is strengthening the OP's argument?
Get out of here before I lose more brain cells.
[Little Red Slicing Hood] i am a kid and what he did was  pretty fucked up i will admit but saying that all of logang are brain washed fucks that don't know what to do and trust me i wish i have learned things that i learned (i know way to much at this age 11) i am apart of that 1% of not brain washed little fucks
btpbtpbtp Parents should be more cautious on what their children are watching
That was just plain stupid!!
.*Know what else died there. Logan Paul's career*
He is psycho, always laughing and making joke almost to everything, 
his mental is unstable
The Paul brothers have zero grasp on the concept of personal privacy
All the disrespect towards suicide victims aside... Why the fuck would you think it's okay to dox a fucking dead body? What if this was the way their family members found out about the death of their loved one? From some dude bro idiot! Like ughhkskrnrbf
WOW even the news jumped on this. (Not that team 10 doesn't deserve it.I'm just amazed it caught on so quickly)
I'm glad they are bringing this to the attention of parents , this is what their children are watching
Kimberly lewis "it's just a dead body, who cares" do you know how wrong that is, are you a sociopath? Would you like it if your dead parents were filmed and laughed at for millions of people to see?
ADPOCALYPSE 3.0
Logan paul has gotten away with a lot of stuff- Too much stuff. It needs to stop. We are used to his stupid antics and disrespectful behavior, but he's taken it way too far this time.[ https://www.change.org/p/youtube-delete-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel ] That is a link to a petition going straight to YouTube asking them to take some action for once. Let's get it done boys.
not kaitlyn Yea I'm glad too so that the parents can start supporting Logan cuz he did apologize and he knows what he did yet people don't appreciate...      #Logang4Life
not kaitlyn change your picture jeez oml
The ONE who subscribe Me I'll subscribe him too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7ITs_mDTPk&t=59s WATCH AND TELL ME WHAT U THINK!!!
welp...atleast it wasnt a clickbait :D
I do not care about this guy but seriously, his fans and everyone knows he and his brother are immature. I highly doubt he will lose many fans because of this.
Finally parents are getting informed about this shit, hope something is going to happen.
OOOK... this comment section got real heated so i am going to adress some points.
Sir Klopp: Children shouldn't be banned from the computers but they should be regularely if not always supervised while using it until a certain age where they can distinguish bad from good.
Mr.Obvious The Fifth: War never changes, but peace will eventually come.
CodyS777: Even if they didn't go into detail about the whole situation, at least parents are gonna get a general idea about what their kids are watching, and that is necessary.
unicorn believer: Trust me, i made mistakes, i have regret, like every other human. But what jake paul did is not a mistake, he went into a suicide forest fully expecting to encounter atleast one suicide victim, he then proceeds to film it multiple times, he doesn't edit the footage out, the video goes through multiple people before it gets uploaded. This is in no way a mistake, he made a concious decision to upload that video because he wants attention, he wants the uproar, he loves it. And finally about those two apologies: the twitter apology was complete bullshit, it wasn't a good apology, the video apology was good, in fact better than most youtube apologies, but when you look at both, he just seems like a complete hypocrite.
Pleace criticize whatever you want.
He is a savage he will kill u
hey watch your language
cool edgy teen 
Well your a shit cuz you said it to someone, you keep judging people by their mistakes you dont look at yourself first so stfu and get out of the comments
Some people are saying that he was joking about it but people can take this in 2 different ways. 1. They can use it as a suicide prevention because in the vlog he did say Suicide is not a joke or 2. You can say he was joking about it but what people dont realize is some people handle situations differently. If I was in his position I probably would have reacted the exact way to and theres many people would react that way to. Now some of the comments he made I do not agree with when he said What youve never stood next to dead body is not something he should have said and showing the dead body is not something that should have been shown. But if some people would have watched the WHOLE vlog then they would realize that when they found the body someone got the security guy from the beginning of the video and they was talking about how the security guy called the police. And everyone is hating on him for posting the video but other people are reposting the same exact video without reacting or responding to it and they are posting the dead body but that okay for them to do it?
Logan's cancer

SIKE a joke he's not he funny RESPECT
https://youtu.be/Ctp-Bg-7quc
That so called apology he wrote wasnt a proper apology. He tried to explain his actions by defending himself instead of apologising to the outraged audience. He is clearly in the wrong and did everything but spreading awareness; I lost all respect for him. My thoughts go out to everyone. Bless up.
+Mohtele haha yeah idk either, some of his videos back then werent that bad
Zan Guides why the fuck did you have respect for him in the first place
Okay but people are killing each other,losing their country,racism.And we worry about an irrelevant white guy.This is our world 
Low life

Allie Lowe keep loosing your self respect and keep following the devil!
M8 logang is kind
To negativity
Even ABC trying to get views and subscribers from suicide
He looks like a douche
I am not a follower of either Jake or logan, But I agree That Logan should of never put that video up on YouTube. It was disturbing, but seriously, at the end of the day we are all humans, we all make mistakes. So just give the guy a break.
Hopefully this will be the end of this talent-less hack.
Raising awareness by laughing and making jokes at a dead body.  IQ level 9999999999
Your going to make him kill him self
Kids shouldnt be watching Logan Pauline he is 2 weird
Allegedly ... Ugh no. There was a DEAD BODY!
He says he wanted to raise awareness about it and didnt want to cause an outrage.
I find that hard to believe after he laughs and jokes about seeing the dead body.
This guy is such a *****************
Heidi Scouten I fully understand people react differently to those types of situations, but he hasn't even mentioned how traumatizing that was for him instead he thought about how he was going to get demonetized, he showed no respect whatsoever like any decent human being would and his apology was just filled with self praising, besides his initial intent for the video was to "go camping in that forest" never to spread awareness about suicide as he said in his pathetic attempt of an apology.
Heidi Scouten he went into a place called the suicide forest, what other intentions could he possibly have? And I laugh when I am uncomfortable or even irritated, but I sure as hell dont crack fucking jokes about never stand next to a dead guy. He showed no respect for that man and made him a prop for his video.
Ravenblaze of SnowClan he laughed because he was in a uncomfortable situation and it isnt uncommon to see people in a distressing situation laugh. Everyone acts a little different, some people cry some people laugh others are silent. His way of coping with the uncomfortable situation was to try and lighten the mood. It was never his intent to have something like this happen
My 9yo son watches this guy
"I didn't do it for views"
 *Uses the dead body as a thumbnail*
Jonesy this is late but chill
@HRA. ALDAY maybe youve forgotten that people are actually going through things? Thats why people commit suicide. But, if there WAS a dead body(which there WAS), then maybe he should have left, not filmed it, and not upload the video! People like you make me feel sick. Get some help man. Jesus Christ
@The KK's no #fucklogang #gotohelllogang

This is growing up experience. 
Gee I dont know about that lady.
one stupid mistake Logan Paul can change everything
R.I.P who person who dies on suicide forest
Dumb and dumber right there xD
What was the name of Logan's friend who was laughing?
LEAVE HIM ALONE!
When everybody become so sensitive, I didn't even see the video. I don't like seeing gay shit on TV, so I choose not to watch Empire, or any show that promotes it. But to talk all that shit about a person because you are emotionally unstable kills me.  Liberals are funny people, y'all will cut somebody livelihood because ya didn't like his video. I think Logan a weirdo, never heard of him till today, but leave that guy alone.
HE DIDNT KNOW!!!!!!
Tomato Potato yes he did! He went looking for dead bodies! He planned a whole trip about it!
u liberals and MSM are freaking retarded.. omg
i just saw the news just now
Welp, i take everything back is said to Jake Paul, unsub Logan and subscribe to Jake
disturbing. he's a child
Stop calling adults children. ..u monster! !!! If his ass went to jail he is considered an adult!
He's a adult he's 22
nah you still act like an idiot 23,24  bit more mature
Christine Damn your pretty

Great way to start off the year
WAY TO GO LOGAN
Awh man I wanted to see the body! But since I dont wanna ever WanT tO eVer Ever look at his face
Literally the first day of 2018 and there is already extremely serious drama.
lucy :3 yep
lucy :3 you guys got to understand that years dont matter at all theyre just numbers ._.
1 aggred
lucy :3 I can't imagine how 2018 will be
CAN EVRYONE LEAVE ALONE LOGAN PAUL SRSLY WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES SO PLS STOP
Logan paul just saying that he gets views and he doesn't do it for views is such a lie anyone has heard of. If he was that sincere, he would've taken it down or never even posted it in the first place.
OtakuGirl Gamer so why did he reupload it??? And now hes making money off it again!
Whos worse doe jake Paul or Logan Paul? XD
What a great way to start the year! Show a dead body and not censor it
THIS WHAT HE DESERVES I REALLY LOOKED UP TO HIM BUT NOW ASHAMED FOR THAT!
The saddest thing is that this has only made Logan Paul more famous. I didn't know who he was before this stunt, now he's being talked about everywhere. People will forget the tasteless act, but remember the name... Fame is fame.
He did all he can to make up for his actions. I dont think he did anything that bad I mean he blurted the face out so idk why people are so heated
He went up right close to the face and laughed about, then edited the video and even sent it out for views. Face it your messiah is a complete turd.
Plus his viewers are young asfuck and the video took time to edit record and Everytime and none of his "yes men " thought it was a bad idea to get million s of views on this man's unfortunate circumstance. Which in getting said views makes him thousands of dollars.  That's why this is disgusting
AGB Gaming exactly
Saying he didn't do anything that bad is sticking up for him
AGB Gaming Oh you foolish little child. Do you not realize that he was laughing at a dead body?
anything for viewsssssss.
this was not a tough enough report - the dude showed a FRESHLY DEAD PERSON IN HIS VIDEO,   I'd go as far as saying that's worthy of jail time.
Damn he's even on the news
I personally watched the original video 2 minutes after it came out. I saw the body and I'm 12. I'm not traumatized. I just went on with my day.
The morons like Paul do stupid shit all of the time. It is ridiculous that this is what it takes to finally do one in.
The system works like this anyways So lets say Every time u click On the video or dislike it They still get paid Nd if u Talk trash about em Thell still get paid y Cause the system thats how it works So if he is all over the internet now He fo show gon get paid big buck buck buckY cause of a video he filmed WHAT A DISGRACE Nd he might say he didnt do it for views but sir he is an actor Logan only wants the views nd even if u didnt mean to click on the video He still gets 10 cents for that click on the video isnt YouTube for artist or for people That know what their doing Not for ppl trying to be an entertainment Or filmimg a video of someone being suicidal like that just wrong Youtube is only for artist ns for people that know exactly what they are doing nd Logan is 22 years old he should've known better not to film that Cause if he thinks oh man 7Y old are gonna watch thise video maybe I shouldn't post it but not he didn't think he just posted it Cause he knew he was going to be everywhere Nd he knew he was gonna get more attention But if u want to be higher than other YouTube's like piewdiepie Or others U have to do it the right way Nd Not by filming a dead body T hats just so so so wrong nd I do hope he learned his lesson.
very disrespectful as so many other you tubers looking for likes or subscribers there are some who are more respectful not like these young guys who are loud and noisy going out there like it's a party touching everything they find..it disgusts me...grow up
*And y'all thought Pewdie was bad.. smh* 
Never heard of him.
Not defending him, what he did was wrong but quotes taken from his video always cut short and only negatives are said, he does later in the video talk about suicide and who to talk to for help, doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does however spread the message to anyone that watched the video.
WHAT A FUCKING GREAT WAY TO START 2018 GOD WHY
FUCK DIS GUY
I think everyone is completely overreacting about this. Yes, I agree his video was kind of distasteful and disrespectful to the dead person. Yes, I think the guy is kind of a douchebag too. Yes,  the way he and his friends behave in this situation is probably a case for some sort of professional.
But I don't think that what the guy did here was somehow evil or wrong. I mean, he took a video, for gods sake. He catched a bunch of photons and uploaded them to the internet. He didn't hang the guy himself. He's not the next Hitler. Nobody got hurt or harmed by his actions. Nobody was forced to watch his video either. In fact, having voted for Clinton is probably still worse than making that video. 
So, I recommend you stop making such a big deal out of this and look for someone to project your hatred on who actually deserves it.
First of all, I already said I dont't like it either.
Second, if you really think killing a person one one hand, and making a video/ photo of a dead person, or even making fun of a dead person on the other hand is in the same category morally, you are deranged.
You cannot possibly compare people who commited genocide to a guy who acted inappropriately in a youtube-video and expect me to take it seriously.
So the Nazis killed people in the street and laughed at them. They left the bodies to desensitize the population that once living people are just trash and can be objectified. German citizens then laughed at the dead bodies too. When will you get it!?!? Stop being a follower and have some dignity and self respect for yourself and other people! Makes me sick!
Well, compared to what? Compared to freedom? No. Compared to his actual competition? I would say so.
yeah, "and having voted for Clinton is probably still worse than making that video". As if trump was a good choice.
It's idiotic for blaming someone that's not afraid to post the truth about the problem going on in other countries if it really is such a big deal then why don't the officials the people in charge take action too minimize the problem this is the world no sugar coating instead of criticizing respect him for showing you ignorant people that never seen a dead body how much of a problem it is and nobody will do anything till some one with a word shows it so in conclusion its the authority and country's fault for negligence ! Logical people you agree I don't care about him but when they blame some one not in fault it irritating go to Japan too see what I mean
Omg 2018 starts like this!! 
ABC forget E. F is for Fake cause ABC news is Fake
This guy is a complete idiot, why do people watch his garbage?
First trending on 2018 wow!
I guess none of you are analyzing his behavior. Yes, he laughs, but do you not see his face before? He is shocked.
EVERYONE reacts differently to situations. This boy was in shock and used humor to lighten the situation. 
He was an idiot for continuously filming and posting, but I truly do not believe he had bad intentions. He was doing his job, which as a YouTuber, is posting videos for money. 
He lacked common sense but the way he reacted is justified. Shock does crazy things to a person.
yeah like saying " if you are sad about this, click subscribe"
Hey, who remembers when Americans took videos of Saddam Hussein being hanged in front of a crowd and uploaded it to youtube so millions of people could see it, and it didnt get taken down? People in the comments were so fucking stoked about it. Remember? Remember watching a leader of another country get killed by Americans, and them making an example of him by showing how they killed him to the world? It wasn't that long ago. The news covered that, but they sure as fuck weren't outraged. And that was murder.
Don't cha just love 2018
Okay who cares if the makes milions or more dollars he is an idiont who filmed A GUY WHO TOOK HIS LIFE that giving morning because of something horible in his life, i am sure that the guy wouldnt want someone to film him if he is depressed. Logan what gives you the right to do that! i have no words
"I didn't do it for the views"
-puts the dead body almost right next to him in his thumbnail
-says we found a dead body in suicide forest in his title
-"like if your sad rw"
Jules It's called welcome to the first week of 2018
Dino His # was logan4life and this  I think.
Yea I think he also tweeted out about his apology video with the caption "#likeforlogang" or "like if you're in the logang". He clearly knows how to handle this situation vEeEeEeEeEery well (not really)
well shit... his dumbass made it on GMA. if this situation doesnt tell him "get your fucking shit together dude." then i dont know what will. fucking disgusting.
Logan took the biggest L of 2018!
Wow. Logan got into the news by showing a person who commited suicide.
He's 22 dat f I thought he was like 28 or 30.???
Nah I see him as 8 years old.
Sanic the Hotdog if you replied it's because you care. Don't say you don't care.
Francisco Santos iiii
Francisco Santos i
https://youtu.be/9fDnBLBgWUY
LUL this got my attention for 3 whole minutes. He won, I guess. LUL
omg hes a kid settle down do u know that forest is a tourist destination? but hes famous so its not ok.....
So Logan Paul is spreading awareness about suicide by laughing at someone who took their life? That's really disrespectful
Let's all agree that Logan is an idiot
I would never
Mr. Man Guy you must be fucking stupid what if your mom did suicide and he makes a joke about her and shows her dead body to millions if people
Just Life. U do have a point
He is a danger to society the way the kids worship him. It's like brainwashing.
That's rude
He just ended his career
he don't know shit, why is this stupid idiot even relevant to begin with. his career should be ended, this is just inexcusable andunforgivable
"growing up experience"??? Wtf? He showed a dead body publicly and even started laughing while showing it.
This is just idiotic.
Heidi Scouten I think the problem is he didn't thought about it when he cut his footage. I mean he had to watch this video while working on it or at least his team if he isn't doing it at his own and it seems they didn't thought that it would be a bad idea to really show the victim on camera and also use him for a thumbnail to get more attention.
And why should everyone forgive so easily about something like that? Logan is over 20 years old. He isn't a kid anymore...
But yeah, about him laughing so akwardly I guess you're right
c_dromedar Okay people are blowing this way out of proportion. He made a mistake and he understood what he did. People spreading the negativity is only making the situation worse, and the reason he was perceived to be laughing at the body is because he was in an uncomfortable situation that he had never been in before. People have different ways of coping with things and his way to cope with uncomfortable and tragic situation is by trying to lighten the mood. It was never his intent to disrespect the victim and did the video in the first place to bring awareness to suicide, they never intended to fine someone. And Im sure as hell positive they didnt mean for anything like this situation to happen
This is crazy this is all over the Internet
This is the future for our children, future for humanity. How low have we sunk that some asshat is filming VLOGS and gets 15 million followers. How pathetic are people that don't have their own life and instead watch the life of some moron.
I except he apologize!! I love him so much
This is awareness. Why hide it. Sometimes hiking you find unexpected things. The face was blurred out and respect and acknowledgement was showed. Its wrong to hide the truth.
Why do the white guys always get cut slack for their stupid behaviour  oh ya big corps pay him big money to mess up your kids minds!  
The future is empty , good luck with North Korea
I know he apologized but a apology doesnt fix this situation.    Thank you for the likes!
Samuel's Sister  ...
+Samuel's Sister it doesn't sound completely sincere, either. It may sound like he cares, but keep in mind, his younger brother is Jake and he is an actor. I'll let you think about that too
*Thank you for the likes.*
He said he didn't expect to be forgiven so he knew what he did was wrong.
Im guessing he deleted it cause now I dont see the vid anymore if anyone can give me the link on the Vid then ty but this is just rude its not okay to record someones death and think its okay to post it on YouTube. Its Logans fault to get hate from his fans. None of his friends did anything about but just stand there and see the death with Logan. Its unbelievable that he would done this. So now his career is over.
He trash
"this is a growing up expirience"... ABC news, your almost as disgusting as logan paul!
miniaturecat oh shit
Klarald Blok this isn't cbs
Heres the copy
https://youtu.be/U9fCiWX6fU4
Yea this was very bad
If he gets banned of YouTube he will lose all of his money and live with his mom or be homeless. If he does it might result to him talking his own life and y'all are criticizing him because of a mistake. I get that he should get hate but if he gets banned from YouTube he will probably lose everything! Can't y'all see what y'all are contributing to??? Y'all are mad because of a video about suicide when if y'all go through with what y'all planning y'all might drive him to kill himself!! Just listen to what I'm saying chill tf down on Logan sure you can hate but don't try and get him banned 
-Lucy- -He- you are promoting suicide
All I saw in your comment was the insane number of yall you used
Oh man if he killed himself.....
Are you even old enough to be on YouTube? First of all,he's already made millions from YouTube and endorsement deals. Money which wont go anywhere even if he's banned from YouTube ( which wont happen because Youtube see money in him). He's a mega rich 22 year old with the bling life and a huge mansion, he has a lot of money to fall back on.
poor logan
Ah shit... here we go
You have got to be joking.
Omg wow, 2018, and we are already under fire...
He is so untalented and doesn't deserve anything he has. His Channel needs to be taken down. He freaking laughed and that bitch in the video with him couldn't stop laughing. His apology wasn't real, he just is trying to save his ass
Not even 2 days into 2018 and the paul brothers had to fuck it up 
Is it a bird!
Is it a plane!
No it's the news cashing in on some easy money!
God please send the flood already.
so sad to see these ppl still trying to defend him
his apology is bullshit he was not raising awareness at all he put a message in the vid for a couple seconds and then proceeded to laugh and make jokes with his friends and he said thats him coping he had time to think hey you know what maybe posting this on youtube would be fucked up while being in the situation,editing the video,and also when he first posted it he could have taken it down as soon as possible but he waited and if he felt any sympathy he would have never posted it i just cant believe he would think what he did was ok and all my love goes to the familys who have ever had to experience loosing a loved one to suicide i am so sorry
Jimmy cowboy butthurt much?
Listen what samantha is sating is right but you got to realize aint no one in this entire planet is perfect so dont get insiquir about his apology ok. You know what would be messed up is that he wouldnt have apoligized at all. At least he had a conscience    to say he sorry. So dont backlash him for something that he didnt think before doing. AM I CLEAR !
Galaxy Gamin He didn't have to upload a video with a dead body for views.
samantha123416 he took it down so quit bad talking him,little bitch
Vincenzo Coccotti You're an idiot.
I never knew this WENT ON THE NEWS
I can already tell 2018 is gonna be great
THIS GUY OMYGOD! and why do the news always get mixed up with followers and subscribers
How is the media any different than this guy?  The media is using the suicide of this man to tell a story and sell advertising.  At least this Youtuber didn't trying to monetise the story.
Oooh, that a Microsoft Surface Pro at the end
No no no no logan
He stupid I dont know why one of my friends is watching him hes crap and stupid he not funny at all
This dude is a fucking let down, so many kids watch this loser and he is bad influence
his brother is just as bad
when fake news isn't fake
maybe you didn't see the LOGAN vlog.  Your right , I never saw the "Lougan vlog" lol but, I did see the Logan Paul vlog . So your comment is fake news then lol
That Real News Life though
maybe you didn't see lougan vlog. your opinion is fake.
SuperMechguy thats true
SuperMechguy  Of course not. It not CNN.
STFU LOGAN IS LIFE 
Humanity is doomed
*you can watch Logan's whole deleted video in my channel*
Horribly disgusting. He need to go to jail.
Fuck you people and your high horse.
Both Paul brothers are such dopes cant believe they are still famous smh
Bro don't give him attention if you don't want him to be watched by kids and teens
1:02 he always gets around 5M views in 24 hours....so 6M isn't a surprise
he just wants to live his life
Think he just ended his career, never watched him anyway
Whats wrong? Yeah He showed a dead body, but if you dont like that then DONT click the video. It was on the thumbnail!?
Ya LOGANG STAND UP FOR YOUR SELF
Man this is just the start of 2018 WHAT HELL IS WAITING FOR US THIS YEAR.
as much you want for yourself
Purple nightmare sounds reasonable xp
Seer Of Balance I predict trump would do some stupid shit, YouTube will go to even more shit, some more famous celebrities will die, we will lose net neutrality, we will have      lots of natural disaters and some shitty meme worse than figet spinners will plague the Internet. 
2016- 
The dark ages only just begun.
Disrespectful Americans going to other countries and causing problems. Shameful!
IT WAS NO MISTAKE ABC HE FUCKING KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING#!!! IT WAS ALL IN PURPOSE!!!!!
The full video of this was extremely SHIT coverage. 
VERY SHIT ABC, very much so.. it's just it's almost disrespectful how terrible this coverage was. 
You basically were treating this piece like some celebrity sex allegations, trying to tell both sides when in this case you are being WILLFULLY IGNORANT of publically obtainable information, because you could have taken 1-2 hours and did a little more research on why people also are calling out Youtube as being hypocritical and partially guilty (Why it's even more controversial, and why people are not buying the apology). The concern is a lot greater than clueless moms of preteen kids. 
You totally bent backwards to power and it is pathetic that you couldn't do better even on a piece like this!
Wait so did he actually show the dead guy or not
His face was censored but yes
it was censored ...
He did
And laughed at his dead body!
im sorry but HE IS STILL GETTING SUBSCRIBERS
YOU FORGOT THE PART WITH HIM TELLING SUCURITY TO CALL THE POLICE and im not mad a Logan Im just dissapointed in him. We are human and we make mistakes. for people who are smart enough to know we are NOT aliens. HUMANS THAT UNDERSTAND  would not be mad because he is HUMAN and NOT a f***in ALIEN! HE HAS APOLOGIZED. Just give him a chance hes a living human.
SORRY
Kaitlyn Gloeckler Smart enough to "no"? 
Americans who are disrespectful of other cultures shouldn't be allowed to visit other countries.
hersheystaste4life  I agree.
And he is 22.
YusefBro he's 22? I thought he looking like 25 - 28 years old.
Very bad
BROOOOOO THIS IS THE BEST HES FINALLY GETTING WHAT HE DESERVES!! GO TO HELL LOGAN PAUL!!
I still love him
Even if he took the video down, it will forever be on the internet, just look at the trending
I wish everyone at ABC would go hang themselves.
15M followers, what is wrong with people ? these clowns
Ahhhh i wish he killed himself in that forest.
Luca Toni I would not say that he tried showing awareness we all make mistakes yeah it was messed up but still he is still a kid he makes stupid decisions so do adults and you should stop saying that cos if you said that to another person would if they did you would have to live ur life knowing you encouraged it even if it was him who did it cos u said that
C nicely sed
Luca Toni you should never say that to people eve if you know then what if someone sed that to you
No. What he did was awful and there is no excuse for it, however you should never wish suicide on anybody. If anything, that's worse than joking around about it.
Luca Toni ;
May you start with yourself, please?
So is where the scum MSM comes out and tells us how to feel and think?... fuck off.
Ugh lame.
Over Priveleged Self Absorbed Queen
Happy New year! maybe next year he will go back and kill himself. saving the youtube trending page from his garbage!
God I hate that guy fuck off login .
Im over Logan
And he posted a shitty half ass 1 minute apology video ?!?! What an idiot, I mean 1 minute come on you are a fucking adult. If youre gonna make an apology video at least put some fucking effort into it.
Yall will just make up anything to get views, he apologized, he was uncomfortable so he was just trying to make hes viewers laugh
Logan who?
he tries to do a right thing but he does it the wrong way
Welp if this is how 2018 is gonna start, then were fucked
another narcisstic sob loser
I wonder how fast and secretly he left Japan haha
1:47 In what way could that video be "positive"
What in the hell has so deeply effected these people that, at some point in their lives, they've become this desensitized to the sight of a suicide victim hanging from a tree? Most people would have left to get help, or break down emotionally, not stand by to laugh and play around. To these punks, this man was never a living person. He was a prop to mock and take photos of.
But, would you post it knowing that kids were going to see it? For money?
Internet has made people into primitive heartless beings, hasn't anyone figured this out yet?
Gorilla Monsoon EXCELLENT COMMENT, VIEWERS MAKE HIM AND VIEWERS GONNA BREAK HIM. GOOD RIDDANCE TO A PERSON WHO HAS NO COMPASSION FOR OTHERS.
Gorilla Monsoon thats very true he should have not recorded it and cut it out of the video because that guy is human too, he must have had many bad things going on in his life and they decide to film that and have his parents, family and friends possibly see that? Thats just stupid, he just did it for the views.
Gorilla Monsoon yeah I agree! I would've been traumatized even at his age
Stop hating
What teen actually watches his videos though
This Paul guy is cancer to our young generation. Just ban him already.
More free promotion for the pauls
ABC NEWS, you just made him look cringe like lol, what am i even doing
Say Adios to ur career
Im sorry but vine/youtube/instagram celebrities need to be controlled at times because they seriously go way too far with clickbait titles etc etc
these news anchors are the real problem here
news anchors have to be unbiased as possible
At least he apologized
DogeKing Kk Guys guys, calms down. The OPs username is DogeKing KK. I mean cmon, he is evidently a troll
Like that fixed anything.
so if someone murdrred a guy and sais oh im sorry i was just upset a lil today lol i apologize thats alright? his apology was terrible
Tyler O Stupid? Huh. Did you forget how to end a sentence?
Yeah he did twice and reuploaded the video. Now hes making 3x more money off a dead person on YouTube! Wow, hes so amazing and such a business achiever! SMH
*finds body in the most notorious place in the world to commit suicide after going off track*
oOf wASnT exPecTInG tHAt
His stupidity level is IMPRESSIVE :(
A talentless Fuckboy with 15 million subs  silly Merrica and then goes and disrespects Japanese land wow
Ur kids might be watching him wtf who watches stupid vlogs about some fucktard
Logan Paul dersevers to go to hell for mocking a dead body
LOL this is our future generation.
YouTube should stop the account
Give em a strike

I can't believe I'm actually agreeing with ABC on something. Hell has frozen over.
They dont deserve views
The whole Paul family is messed up
End them
Kids is stupid that is why they subscribe him
"Allegedly" showed a dead body hahahahaha
Shittt abc is on this omfg bye Logan his career is gone now hes not coming back from this smhhh
Fuck Logan why did you upload that video and it's worse he used the guys body in the thumnail
The guy who committed suicide might have had kids and they proubly didn't know that man committed suicide until they saw Logan's video 
I'm not giving Logan hate I'm just saying 
Like my coment or you will die in 7 days not really but still like my comment
Mac Faggo In 7 days? Does this have anything to do with The Ring
"A growing experience"
I present to you, the journalistic standards of ABC. Surely even a 10 year old would know not to laugh at a hanging body.
Aisia Houghton gurl simply put he shouldn't have posted the video in the first place
+Aisia Houghton I agree with you there, but uploading the video and trying to exploit a dead man for views?
Potato Power I bet you would laugh to.. it was probably so surreal for him he didn't know what to do at the time
GROWING UP EXPERIENCE?! EXCUSE ME
Oh well there goes vlog paul
He did NOT mean it THIS way #logang4ever you can hate but THIS is My opinion
I see his vlog he is the best
Abc fuck you

Derpy Uchiha hey now they are just a kid, I doubt they are even old enough to drive a car, let them be, kids and make mistakes and grow from them, the one who is awful is logan, he is the one who should be insulted, not his prepubescent fans
andie xo doesn't being a goblin come with the territory of being fugly and a joke though?
Bailey Barge Logan Paul sucks so deal with it you no life
Every human makes a mistake like Logan Paul ,but it doesn't mean people have to tell him things I known he made a mistake but I but respect on Logan Paul OK ..................
Aracely Mejia

Aracely Mejia he is a moron!
Im a Japanese. I hope he never come to Japan.
piggies for life 
THANKS CAPTAIN OBVIOUS! 
YOU SURE SAVED THE INTERNET FROM A SUPER OBVIOUS AND OVERUSED JOKE THAT'S BEEN GOING AROUND FOR ABOUT A HALF A YEAR NOW. 
Who are you kidding? You're trying to turn this around, but it's obvious that you're just out of the loop or trying really hard to be dry and pretentious.
Jacob Wiles well excuse you, but I just said it isn't a city so yeah. So it ends here. Sorry, sir
piggies for life 
It wasn't a mistake you dumbass.I said it as a Joke mocking Logan and Jake Paul for calling England a city in their official song. I never once thought England was a city. Nobody does that's why it's funny to make fun of him for saying that.
Are you dense? Do my words make sense?
Jacob Wiles look it ain't dumb pointing out your mistake . Plus it makes you look dumb saying England is my city
piggies for life 
That's the joke. All you're doing is pointing it out. Which looks dumb.
You know it get so serious when ABC makes a news report about it.
Why allegedly he already did it
CROSSED A LINE
GUYS! A 16 YEAR OLD KID KILLED HIS FAMILY AND ONE FAMILY FRIEND MINUTES BEFORE MIDNIGHT IN NEW YEARS EVE WITH A RIFLE. 
GUYS! YOU HEAR THAT- 
Oh.. wait..
Everyone is too busy talking shit about Logan Paul.
Dammit.
God, i HATE him!!!! he is the biggest douchebag & everything he says is fake. just like his apology; fake emotion & scripted
People in the comments I mean children in the comments keep saying "he said sorry, he's paying for it" yeah ok so when someone stabs someone and says "oh hey sorry I killed you friend but here's some money and I'm sorry" no thats not how things fucking work he's literally a year older than me. I know the difference from posting something like this to not. To laughing at someone's hanging fucking body. He's a  Fucking cunt wad he deserves all this fucking hate
A_Pineapple Andrews He didn't mean to edit, upload and the use the body as a thumbnail to get as much views as possible? Grow up kid, what he did was very wrong.
He was in shock.Stabing and being in shock are 2 different things he did not mean to.
Knoppy preach.
I unsubed  from his channel.  Sick and evil human being. all u who still side with him are just as bad as him
IM DEAD SHE SAID 15M FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE DUMB ASS
Yo mainstream media why don't you ruin endorsement deals for this piece of shit. Use your bs for good for once
Just hanging out with a dead guy
Can't believe it's now on the news
Wow Logan wow I hate him
This thing is on the headline. I mean this is just rude
Hang in there
holy.
Let's see if The news will call the popo
he is on drugs he fucked up!!
Oh no 
OH NO HE GOT IN YOUTUBE NOW NEWS?!!?
This is bad he's getting arrested
Ya I saw that
i saw the vid... its so sad, like the dead guys hands had turned purple, due to horrible reasons and it looked like the sad death happened just that moring, or during the night... dont even think about attempting to find the video somewhere.
He should have stoped recording and call the police and the ambulance right away
Basically he is a attention seeking Man child just like his douchebag brother.
Amazing how his fanbase continues to make excuses for him and downplays his repulsive behaviour.
All of these idiot kids saying that people are pussies and shit because, what? We have fucking brains and know what Logan did was wrong? Because clearly the 'Logangs' Or whatever are to idiotic to even like the two brothers. But again, the fan base is full of 4-10 year olds soo..
WildAnimalLover Logan has been done alot of bad things with his brother which wouldn't really make one mistake
LOGANG4LIFE As it is you really do like a moron that thinks in a way which hurts alot of people and you are just complaining there when logan even said he dosen't deserve to get defense of this and look I don't know why I'm in an argument with a logan fan which funny enough to not know where to cross a line.
Eve Luntern well they do have to get access to show the bodies even if they do they wouldn't show the serious injuries but unlike Logan he had no permission to show a dead person and got away with until he did the right choice and took down his video.
HawaiianPunchzx Sure they might of not knew how to react like hell is anyone going to see thier whole family get murdered then get their house burned down then post this on YouTube to get many views yeah I'm pretty sure alot if people don't want to see their own family get killed.
OML he deleted
A daily show
This is the problem I have been trying to tell you all for the longest. once we start whoring ourselves for popularity, all morals and ethics go out the windows. F you crony capitalism
He should have been up that ree.
He is indeed disrespectful and he deserves the negativity. Why?
Oh because he and his friends laugh on the poor soul, he zooms in the body, shows the body and uses it on the thumbnail. What else worse can he do? Make jokes about it?
I just cant believe him. I lost respect from him and he really owes and apology to everyone in the internet.
He made 2 apologies and re-uploaded the video. Now hes making 3x as much off someones death. And gives no money to any suicide prevention charity or the family of the unfortunate soul. Hes a horrible self serving idiot!
It's not just apology, he don't deserve views if he keep making trash content like this. Hope youtube do something. But it they doesn't seems bother.
Screaming Zebra This is all to get him more fame and notoriety. Eight years from now people will not know who he is. Lets not forget; everybody wants there 15 min of fame.
Then maybe they shouldnt have such a fucking idiot and killed themselves.
Primo How is this disrespectful. Ok he saw a dead body ? So and ? We see dead bodies here in  Los Amgeles all of thr time. Please ? Who cares ?
So did he spend the night or was he to pussy?
Early. Logan just got Sued.
I don't like logan Paul but he shouldn't get criticized
Logang for life like if you agree
Im sorry about that it sucks he was trying to prevent suicide so other people dont lose family members
Joshua Williamson HE LITERALLY RECORDED THE FUCKING BODY AND MADE JOKES ABOUT IT MINUTES LATER. YOU ARE A FUCKING MORON. I lost my brother by suicide and of he filmed his dead body hanging I would fucking murder him.
He made a mistake everyone makes mistakes hes only human he was just trying to tell people how serious suicide is. You probably just dont like him
Honestly I myself had never heard of Logan prior to this incident nor have I viewed the offending video. I have read a number of articles about it though. It seems Logan and his crew need to take personal responsibility for their behaviour which was extremely inappropriate. Logan and his crew are not exempt of responsibility and brought this "monsoon of negativity" on themselves. Moreover his apology seemed sanctimonious and insincere. Making light of another person's death particularly in the context of suicide only shows a blatant disregard for the deceased, his family members and all who choose to take their own lives. Furthermore there are other ways to raise awareness about suicide besides filming and laughing about a corpse in a geographic location where suicides are known to take place. Logan and his crew's poor judgment doesn't just affect them but the entire You Tube community as a whole. Logan and his crew are setting a bad precedent for those who subscribe to his channel and all content creators. You Tube should NOT be used as a platform for this brand of tasteless tripe and ghoulish garbage. In closing, the outrage and backlash Logan and his crew are on the receiving end of is warranted and those who endorse or far worse defend Logan and his crew are just as insidious and evil. What Logan and his crew did was inexcusable and needs to be addressed. Let this be a lesson to all. This cannot and should NOT be tolerated now or ever. Logan tried to use this footage for his own personal and professional gain, not to raise awareness about suicide. I sincerely hope all who endorse or financially back Logan and his channel do an about face so that there is never a reprise of this again!
Alex Chase I dont swear but  F&$@ Off. HE RECORDED A DEAD BODY AND LAUGHED!!! Thats enough to be able to write upon the subject
T Angelone I read the first three words and said I ain't reading the rest
T Angelone so you think not knowing who the guy is and not having seen the video means you still have enough credibility to speak on the subject? LMAO! Fucking moron.
He doesn't understand anything and he's clearly way too immature to understand what he's done and what he's been doing. His apology doesn't mean shit cos he keeps doing it. And of course his channel is still up and he's still being paid.
T Angelone sorry, but, I aint reading that
HIS CAREER IS GONE!!
Nice he ssrly fucked up
0:34 that bitch makes me triggered
#LOGANG4LIFE
HE LAUGHED AT THE POOR MAN
Houstons Inzanetiger he didnt mention the word denial, but he is in denial
Doesnt matter now that his comment was removed
A_Pineapple Andrews are u laugh when u see dead body? Yes or No..
True..fuck him n his friends
i used to be a big fan of him But now - NO Not Anymore ill just watch jake paul for a sec
RayGunBros he didnt say denial....
Logan's New Year Resulution for 2019 is to not make drama for at least two days
Starting the year off on a "GREAT" start guys!
You know in two weeks something sad is going to happen to logan and everyone is going to forget
He wasnt freaking disrespecting the body!! He never meant to!! He was freaking shocked!! He didnt know what to do!!!! What would you have done if you saw someone hanging?? I would have run, but other people have different reactions!!! Why dont you understand that?!?
Generation X has doomed man
Piece of garbage. And tell me why YouTube kept that shit up and let it trend??? Honestly this whole thing is fucked
Go away tv people
At least he has the balls to do it. I got some balls to say this. Fuck u Youtube
He is amazing 1 mistake
forevermoreJoy101 one mistake that actually made others kill themselves because it trigger them seeing it in the thumbnail yeah 1 fucking mistake
The thing that was funny they said he was entertaining and funny
Logan Paul is a savage he is more fans than you
And he did not use for views
So one Im 10 and Logan Paul has no right to post that I know but people post sucide videos on YouTube all the time and no one gets in trouble its only him that gets in trouble because he has 15 million subscribers and you know just as I do that Logans fans would have been mad if he didnt post that day and he laughed because he didnt know how to react because like he said he has never seen that before he made a apology video on it, he didnt mean it
amberly bordayo "savage" showing someone's dead body posting with ads to make money laughing and making jokes about it yeah so fucking savage you little 12 year old
Logang does not know what's the difference between what's good and bad.
This news is stupid
2018 is already starting off terribly
Fucking Logan Paul and this abd and that.  No body never said shit about fake news and me wanna kill all of you. ABC News is making youtube a joke.
Logan Paul did the right thing taking a video of that person who died amen bro I love him doesn't need to apologize at all he did the right thing who cares doesnt need to make a big deal about it he made right choice taking a video of the dead body ................................ jk I care for the person what he did was wrongly. I think
plus I wrote this to see if some one would get triggered if I wrote this I was right
final commando 
He couldve brought awareness to suicide/depression without showing the dead body and making a joke out of it. But he didnt. He made a joke out of someone who committed suicide. That poor man took his own life and he cant even be in peace after death
final commando what are you, fucking gay?
Its on the news logang is now no longer logang
OH GOD
Why tho why did he do that
*followers* on youtube 
WHY WHY WHY YOU YOU YOU
NOOOOOOO
A START TO 2018
We all gonna die and you bitch about this. Everyone live but no body wanna dies.
Too bad he cant do it like Logic smfh. That was no way of raising awareness for suicide prevention. Fucking white piece of shit .
And you guys made this loser more popular by putting him on the fucking news
i used to be a fan of him, not anymore. what he did was absolutely disgusting, and insensitive.
Oh shit...
Pls end this bitch career he's pure stupid
I'm kind of ashamed to share my birthday with this guy. I don't know much about the Paul brothers (until now) at least but I can see they are pretty brash people who don't make very good choices. Hope to God this is a learning experience.....
Oh no... like i care he deserves this thats all that is important
Don't see how you can be a victim of suicide lololol
Aaaand he made the news. He made the fucking news. Rip Logan Paul
How did he think he was going to get a positive reaction from the Internet 
Just stop talking shit about Logan.
He went on news!?
I'm sorry if this offends anyone but I don't feel sorry for people who commit suicide I think they take the cowards way out think you about it you have people and little kids who have Cancer And everyday they fight to stay a live they deserve to live and then you have people who kill themselves Because of things they can workout on their own but are just to weak to do so
There going to make his life like Matt Lauer
Alright... see you on the other side, everyone
#whatruinyoutube
Oh he really fucked up 2018
You have fucked up now
Wow great job pual
I didn't expect this to make it on the news
He makes millions on endorsement deals
Like what? His own merchandise?
*OOPS*
If i was him i would stay off YouTube for the year.     Without a doubt he is banned from Japen and he's probably one of the most hated people in the world right now.
Leave him alone he did no harem it lasted 30 seconds
omari johnson This is adrianna mother and I will talk to her about what she posts online
vintage for now this is his mother! You are very rude!
omari johnson  laughing of shock not of a dead body so leave him the fuck alone
Knoppy first of all he was laughing sadly and in shock
So if you have something to say come at me I got my proof
vintage for now actually yes it did a few people who saw the video went to the hospital because the dead body pushed them over the edge. But hey let's make fun of suicide
Not teenagers just children
He and his brother are ugly as fuck
Haha 2018 the en of Jake Paul!!!
Grace Spencer end and logan
I've actually never heard of him.
turner pike damn Id stay under that rock man! Dont waste your time!
wow logan wow... your a terrible man for this
Courtneyy xo oh shit my my bad XD
Akane-sSan true
Akane-sSan True, theyre breaking the violations of YouTube but its like the YouTube owners literally dont care. Any other channel  wouldve been banned not shortly after.
Courtneyy xo it is not logan
But both of them fucked up bad time
Those sociopaths should be banned from youtube but since the new management, youtube is only after money and they are their money mills
So much for 2018... he was also almost in tears on his apology vid he made. People need to know it was sincere
Reminds me of Jonghyun 
__ Arii __ WHY IM CRYING
"I had a positive intention" BULLSHIT
Thank you Logan for doing something fucked up during the beginning of 2018 :)
It sucks to be Logan Paul
Apparent
SHIT HeS DEAD
Oh shit
15 million followers
This is horrible he shouldnt of laughed about a dead person. When his friend in the video said to put the camera down he should of. This is so stupid he now needs to raise awareness about suicide or something. He needs to do something to help fix the damage he had done. He shouldnt of posted anything and even though he apologized he needs to do more.
WELCOME TO FUCKIN 2018!!!! IM GONNA GO INSANE!!!
Logan not doing it for the views since when does he not do videos for views
Ok showing a body if u look that up on yt u will find a lot of this crap Logan did once ppl go into haunted places and see dead people corps now tell me thats true.
he's actually one of the worst people in the world he's very rude he's actually a rich jerk if you talk s*** to me you can go and f*** yourself I don't care plus he's not funny
Who does that make a video with Dead body this kid sick
fucking dumass
Logan paul is sucks
England is my city, and Logan Paul is shitty.
Well, guess hell have to kiss those endorsement deals goodbye. Given the deals arent taken quickly enough that he doesnt have time to.
shit I feel bad now what a great way to start the year
*disgusted noise* stupid news TAKE DOWN IT EVERY DAY BRO
$+$+377_7"+7_7_7$-GHZHFSGHDBNHBBDJU
Oops I press on my phone in anger
He should be forced to make a bbw porno
"this year"
For everyone who don't know Logan Paul, he's basically the biggest Jackass/dumbass on this platform.
His brother Jake Paul held the title of biggest Jackass/dumbass.... until this recent Logan fiasco.
Anthony Dion yep and so is his brother
Anthony Dion What about when filthy Frank went to Japan and made an ass of himself there?
Anthony Dion your going to be the course of his death 
Hey guys I have more than 10 followers on youtubestagram!
YouTube what the fuck are you doing.
Why isnt YouTube banning Logan? 
Why did YouTube put his video on trend?
This is fucking-ugh I dont even know. YouTube is fucked.
Get your shit straight ABC. He found a body, there's no allegedly to it.
We couldn't even go 24 hours in 2018 without a Paul brother fucking something up.
NOOOOOOOOOO
The only thing he made us aware of is he's a inconsiderate ass!
I actually used to like him. This is really disappointing tho, and i hope he pays the consequences.
Not sure what the big deal is.....but why would anyone watch this idiot?
And I thought he sucked beforehand
I can't believe abc is so out of touch it called subscribers followers
Well hello 2018
YouTube became a shit show
What a great way to start 2018 im glad something finally happened for him to realize that he is pure trash and doesnt deserve the success aka views he gets he may 20 something but he's still a stupid kid!
Logan Paul needs to delete his channel. Youtube should act now.
Fucking idiot mate Logan Paul is a fucking twat sorry for language mate but come on who records and then laughs at a dead man
Self awareness my ass
Well I sure hope a lot of people learned a thing or 2 from this
Hes a good YouTuber beter than Logan Paul but hes owing up to it.
So abhorrent.  For anyone who has suffered from depression,  has had suicidal thoughts, knows people who have committed suicide... the video is the antithesis of "helping" people.
If he intended to raise awareness then he wouldnt have been joking about it.
Ok this is going to far
*WHAT A DAMM GREAT START TO 2018*
Well the news has finally done something right
Did you no he is going to hell because he .are fun of a dead body and god won't forgive people who do do ugly jokes
2018 an already ....this...
"15 million flows on YouTube"
Well I think these fuckers are the one who should apologize
What is sick is how he acted and everything he said in the video was literally natural. Meaning this type of action is in his nature as a person. Like he never gave any thought to anything he said or did. Yuck dude.
Still dont understand why mainstream celebreties are tweeting this about a youtuber
LEAVE LOGAN ALONE GUYS JEEZ HE DIDN'T MEAN IT HE DIDN'T KNOW LET HIM GO I MEAN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
https://t.co/UaKqms36yD anything helps thank you
https://www.change.org/p/youtube-delete-logan-paul-s-youtube-channel
He deleted the video right?
YouTube get Logan Paul of YouTube,taking the piss out of a dead body,I suffer with Anxiety and Depression and the video he uploaded is totally sick.Making money of a dead human being,SAD
Stop it ok?  Ok he made one video on the suicide forest.  He is my favorite YouTuber and I don't wanna see his Chanel go down to the bottom because he is the only person that keeps me alive I DON'T WANT TO LOOSE MY HERO
nick the prince that still doesn't make his actions acceptable and he deserves the consquences he is getting.
Im so happy about this. I cant believe his career is gonna be a dead end now am I right. So happy that people finally see what a piece of shit he his
starting out the new year right with Logan Paul ending his career
https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=302_1514860746
For those who havent seen this sickening event
yes ! make this shitty  big and end once and for all
it was funny tbh
This just destroy his reputation
Oh my goodness... HOLY!
Yessss
You now its really bad when abc news is on the case
Its fake
15 million followers..... .-.
Stop fucking with Logan, he made one mistake, calm the fuck down
Rayan Mukhales my friend you are severely blinded but your unconditional love for the man in the screen. He did something wildly disrespectful and yes, we can choose to not watch it, but he has millions of impressionable children watching him everyday and seeing this behavior thinking its acceptable. Mocking a suicide victim, turning their life and eventual untimely end into a joke is disgusting. Furthermore, seeing a dead body in a situation like this can be triggering to someone mentally unstable, and although he said he was saving lives, the more likely outcome is he took some. Dont be a Logang sheep, think for yourself. Sorry doesnt cut it. Maybe if this guy is your idol than maybe you need to rethink that.
as soon as you fuck up and they know you got money..they say he drives a Ferrari, he lives in LA, hes a spoilt brat..fuck outta here with all that hating shit
Although it gave me nightmares it wasnt bad watching
*DON'T READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO GRAPHIC CONTENT OR SUBJECTS THAT CONSISTS OF SUICIDE AND DEATH*
*It sucks that I have to give that sort of warning for something like a rant/opinion about a topic so popular right now.*
Is everyone really flipping about a dead person who hung themselves and Logan just so happened to come across it in a place that's notorious for people hanging themselves at? I feel bad for Logan Paul having to take down a video of him coming across that person's sort of demise as a path someone chose to take. But mainly people pointing at him as if its his fault that someone would be dumb enough to click on the video the first place. And on top of that, still trying to make light of a dark situation and finding. XD Like, sure. Condolsences to the guy, but does no one get the point that it could be fake? Nor really get the point of the video if they click on it or not? Like, you clicked on the video to what he saw and decided to record. It's not his fault someone committed suicide that had earned its reputation for people dumb enough to commit suicide.
Suicide is a damn choice they made. A dumb one. Maybe not the only choice, as there are plenty of other choices to make. So before you hurt individuals try to place blame on someone who happened to came across it, click off so you won't get offended for whatever they do. Simple as that.
lol ok buddy :)
sure, you can come across it, but it's never right to film it. Death should never be laughed at, and they are doing that while they're filming it. "you clicked on the video to what he saw and decided to record. It's not his fault someone committed suicide that had earned its reputation for people dumb enough to commit suicide". You really sounded like an idiot here. For sure, you are just a child too naive. Hope you don't grow as the degenerate logan paul you are idolizing.
LMAO. This is what people are losing their minds for? Aw what happened? Cant take what literally everyone makes fun of nowadays? Suicide is literally the biggest joke of 2017 and who made it a joke? The same people who get so anally annihilated when it actually happens. Everyone saying I wish I was dead Im so depressed I want to die kms etc etc
You cant make this shit up. Every other YouTuber and their mothers has an opinion and say in this apparently
How to ruin you career in one short vlog
*WHAT WE DO HERE IS GO BACK*
The Holy Dream You wanna go again Broly?
Can yall sub to me plz
were waiting idubbbz
Plleeeaaaasssseeee

15 million *followers*
He's fake he needs help
Logan sucks angry grandpa is better
I hope his channel gets deleted. What a great way to start 2018
Hey forgive Logan Paul cause saying making fun laughing at a died body you for real I was the 65million people to see the original video and I saw him not laughing at the victim next to him or any of that bullshit so dont say he was laughing at him or next to the victim k 
2nd with the 2018 shit we just started 2018 and your all being babys did you see creepy stuff before yes if you didit wtf are you even here stop with it man 
And 3rd forgive Logan and no hes not getting ban anytime soon and anything and it was a fucking mistake like your small brains can know anyway haters can fuck off and hate on something else who agrees with me that well be awesome but fuck the haters 
Learn what you looking at and look at the pass of YouTube #logangforlive #fuckthehaters #stopwiththe2018shit 
And one more thing he did not and I mean DID NOT make the video for views.
Killerfoxy Foxy brainwashed kid smh
Killerfoxy Foxy my friend you are severely blinded but your unconditional love for the man in the screen.

The Pauls parents are complete failures.
Bless 2018
-Sigh- Logan Is a low down jerk.
Growing up experience bitch ass is 22 he should have learn his shit before becoming an adult
He aint sorry, sadly he doesnt care about the outrage.
This is a start to 2018
Hopefully those stupid fucking parents wake the fuck up and crack the whip on there kids
Ask your self ..who in their right mind besides a physician mortician or coroner would be so comfortable enough to take time to spend with a dead body 
Never the less to do some heinous shit like like he did to film the hands as if it they were props on movie set
Is nothing sacred..anything ?
A mistake?  you make mistakes on math exams  and sewing projects this goes beyond the pale
and the crazy fucks that were with him just as rancid who thinks suicide is cool?
Logan anything for views Paul
that's who and apparently a the vast majority or his equally soul less subscribers
Sick bastards the lot of them
Fuck Logan paul
Entertainment < showing a dead body for views and money
I love Logan Paul he's the best and I watched that video The suicide forest
Remember Alex from target?
oh come on. Logan Paul is now on abc?
*breathes in deeply*
*n o*
Knoppy 
Okay yeah true..
maiki I mean when someone fucks up it kinda happens you know I mean showing a dead body in Japan is illegal
He has 15million followers on youtube
Like bruh its subs/subscribers
Even is his apology he still finds a way to brag about his views. If YouTube doesnt terminate his account they are showing the whole world that things like this go unpunished
Anyone who subscribes I'll subscribe back 
Hellllllllllllllllllllllllllllll nnnnnoooooooo
22? this dude look like he 32 lolol
I get that everyone wants to catch something crazy bad on camera, but actually posting that video? There are so many other ways he couldve shared his experience in that forest that didnt include spending hours editing and uploading the video. Not to mention his fans are extremely young. The only reason youd post a video like that is for views. Getting a dead body on camera is a dream come true for click-baiters. If his plan was to make a serious video about suicide, a different video couldve been made explaining what happened at the Japanese forest. Its ludicrously disrespectful to the family, to have their loved one featured on a YouTube video by a bunch of idiots who dont know how to deal with suicide appropriately.
And they say jake paul is the worst youtuber ever.
Gg well played
Finally... I hate him
stop talking about him
You he could have made a good ripple WITHOUT SHOWING THE BODY!!
I'm mad i missed the video
What's bothering me is that she said followers not suscribers.
Bye bye Logan
Follow me to watch the deleted video.I saved it before it got deleted.R.I.P dead person LINK IN DESCRIPTION https://youtu.be/2hCwe2fZztA
Logan and jake Paul suck dicks such fucked up morons he fucks himself

Logan Paul ended his own career... 2018 might be a good year after all!
Yeah for    LOGAAAAN ............
I hate u logan paul:)
Stop putting him one every NEWS CHANNEL
Bad news: A shitty start for New Year
Good news: Logan will have an 85% chance that he will end his career
Well shit. Logan Paul is making YouTube look REALLY bad.
Rabitita umm, he's making himself look bad...
Rabitita that boy is making money
Rabitita  is not making YouTube look really bad Get straight or grow up YouTube is never Going to look bad
He's making white people look bad when they go visit Japan as tourists. Japanese people already think lowly of us, and now it'll be worse.
Yes yes he is you don't record a dead body
OK BUT..... DID THEY HAVE TO MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT?????
BUT WAIT SHE SAID HE COMMITTED SUICIDE RECENTLY. WHAT IF GOD SET THIS UP SO THAT SOMEONE WOULD FIND THE DEAD BODY . AND GOD MADE A FAMOUS PERSON DO IT SO THAT IT WOULD GET ATTENTION AND GIVE THIS PERSON A PROPER BURIAL?! DONT BS ME , IM NOT TRYNA BE BLASPHEMOUS BUT I FEEL IM GOING SOMEWHERE !
BECAUSE BE HONEST, NOBODY WOULD HAVE FOUND THIS BODY IF PEOPLE ARENT ALLOWED TO GO IN IT .
IM NOT TAKING SIDES BUT ALL IM DOING IS TWISTING THIS INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE IG . !
Why would I want to subscribe to y'all after saying soooooo many negative things about logan paul?
His whole fan base is children. Sick.
Wether his apology is real or fake either way he still got publicity for it and my opinion is that this was intentional on his part and he is just on damage control now. 
P.s. words are cheap.
Excuse me?
He did nothing wrong.
Im not going to bash him to harshly for his reaction but he shouldnt have posted it. As a paramedic Ive seen many responses to death and since hes never seen a dead body before his mind couldnt understand and comprehend the situation placed in front of him and some people handle grief by laughing and jokes
Login paul should delete his channel
Pewdiepie isnt looking so bad now, huh?
He was so innocent he had no idea! Is this the end.......

Logan!
2018 is starting off great
He needs his neck stretched. Lame Hipster.
Apparently?? Ffs people, why making it seem a "not so bad" issue? This is ridiculous.
What a way to start off the year
Hes fuckin dumb
Great, more youtube drama.
wow it's barely the beginning of a new year and he already messes up big time. Honestly how is he a role model for kids....
what a great way to start out 2018 smh
Holy shit Logan is on the news. He fucked up. He didnt mean it tho. Unless he did. But anyways,, Im still shook
This will be a terrible year for paul. Suicide is not a joke @loganpaul
You even laughed when that dog died 
Japan should ban him from going back there literally
What a great way to start 2018
The suicide Forest... There was a movie called The Forest based on that Forest.. o-o
TERRIBLE way to start off the year smh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiaIV0Jz48A Worth listening to someone who actually respects this sort of stuff.
Why do they say followers if it is subscribers
Quality News.
"Allegedly" Nah he straight up did it.
PLS PLS PLS he REGRETS posting it I watch him and he made a video called "so sorry" he said he was sorry he didn't mean to do it and REGRETS it so much so PLS PLS PLS don't be angry at him PLS he even told us in the video when he went to go to the forest to not do suicide
suicide prevention my ass
all these hate comments i read made me cry ..... I know what he did was wrong but imagine your favorite youtuber is hated by the world..... what would you feel
Take him off U Tube
Saying he wanted to make people aware of suicide is bullshit!
I hate when people say followers on youtube
iTz_KuSh same
He makein a BANG in NEW YEAR 2018 and not in good way SMH
2018 in a nutshell lol
well we're 3 days into it
"A growing up experience." Really. 
What the fuck.
Show the video and stop being misleading please.
ADPOCALYPSE 3.0 COMING SOON
Reputation right down the drain.
What a shame ... But then again
Who cares ...
What a beautiful way to start 2018.......
You know she doesn't watch you tube because she called his subs followers
You made a big deal about logan but a channel called TFIL encounterd a body too.... and filmed it too didnt seem to be a big deal
Schnaider nineseveneight
Are there cuts in Logans video? Or things blurred out? To e.g. make someones face appear blurry, you have to edit the video. Period.
gabagandalfoftheweed
 ; you know nothing. You just assume what you would do.
xbabejordanx x ; wow,wow  you are being disrespectful now, hypocrite
Kpop Queen0617 Finally, you actually have a brain. All these sensitive people are saying that he laughed because it was funny. If all you sensitive people have a brain, then you would know that no one would ever laugh at a dead body.
#DefendLogan
I dont want to defend him #FuckLogan
I know I just want attention to my channel
The First Savage Wolf fuck you brainwashed kid your trying to defend a ass whole who filmed a corpse and didn't blur it and was laughing about the situation
Yay more people reply more Im viral yayyy
Die in a hole
Meany
*Unsubscribe him.*
Oh wow
LEAVE THIS ALONE IT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!!!!!!
I fuckin hate logan and jake paul but the part where he laughs to cope with the shock in his body doesnt deserve that much hate. Ive been through fucked situations where you almost dont control what your bodys initial reactions are. It sucks and its normal
This is not okay
I get views , hastag emoji omg apologie
Welp...we are reddy known what 2018 gonna be
I would like to say I hate both Logan and Jake Paul. ... But Im not a hater... They just aren't my interest... What they do just doesn't catch my eyes...
My boy on the news esketit
He has 15 million FOLLOWERS on YouTube I cringed 
I was sleeping when this happen. Now i hate him
"He has fifteen followers on YouTube" Bitch its subs get it right lol
lol Logans Pauls a jackass
Congratulations logan, you have all the views, all the attention... What a disrespectful dumbass.
I saw this video ( the original video ) I didnt like it
how shocking that one of the paul brothers would be in the news already
Now there changing the story 
So many other YouTubers have shown dead bodies and Logan Paul is the worst he was also laughing to not to focus on sad part and he is getting hating on to much
you mean subscribers not FOLLOWERS ya old mong
Stap he said sorry stap making him feel bad
Good job news
ABC NEWS?!?!?!?!! Oh wait nvm
And I thought Sam Pepper was the biggest asshole on YouTube...
Jesus Christ... That famous?!?!?!?
All these children in the comments honestly scare me.
Fuck jake
Not even a full day in 2018 and the Paul Brothers already got the biggest douche award next to Trump. We should've left these assholes in 2017.
I'm suicidal :(
He's going to lose lots of subs
Its only a mistake cause hes losing money
Good job logan paul.
Oh my god leave him alone
XGlum DropsX why don't you raise a child by always siding with it no matter how wrong it is, see how well that goes.
XGlum DropsX lmao, you think just leaving her will make it better? She needs to learn but she clearly won't because there are people like you and people like her parents that will always side with her no matter how much in the wrong she is.
T H I C C B O I, 
If Brooklynn is a child then why are you being rude to the poor small human?
These replies come to show how disgusting we are, like Logan Paul.
Brooklynn Yuill lmao, I just went into your channel and only saw shit, it's pretty clear that you're a fucking child with the content you like and make, pathetic bitch.
This is fucking news
This guy is a dumbass
Black Mirror
Love live life
Way to start the year
Swaggy Kitty101 be quiet you loser
Swaggy Kitty101 so right...
Even more smiles are sent!
It can get better! just send some smiles and!
Guys this never happened before this year is new right so Logan is sorry stop hating he has to live his life suicide is literally not a f**king joke you don't do that that's why we have lifes we are not alone and you guys think it's a joke if you guys think it's a joke umm go live with your family do vacation and live your life P.S Please Stop.
This is why I don't watch Logan Paul videos.
i will subscribe to anyone who subscribe for me 100% true go to my channel and comment your name on vines video. i swear i will  sub.
I would probably still like logan paul even if he injured someone
When YouTube gets on the news you know its bad
You idiot.
We japanese never forgive you.
Apparent
Hahahahha im 12 and i was one of the first 1000 views of the video
This is insane
*WHAT A START TO 2018 *
ALANI UNDERWOOD LOOOOSERRR
Chizzy 2019*
@ALANI UNDERWOOD the damage was done before his apology bitch
Chizzy Lol its 2019 now
Lmao took too long
*WHELP THERE GOES LOGAN PAUL'S CAREER*
Well he's back
@ch am wickramasinghe stop defending Logan Paul, and learn to spell dipshit.
If only
"Oh OK!" said some 8 million ignorant people (possibly Trump/Hillary supporters) "This guy did all these horrible things on a channel kids watch! Let's subscribe to him!"
Stfu kid
That video was trending on Youtube. Youtube is more than proud to allow a video like that to be put up, but DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE CURSE IN A VIDEO!
As someone with bpd I have been hospitalized for suicide idealization/attempt's 12 times I am on medication to help me ,this kinda behavior of not respecting the dead /sick the making money is making me extremely pissed off this isn't a joke this is a real problem with real people . I have felt what the victim has felt I've been in that hole . The paul brothers need to be banned because when a kid says I will die for Logan it is a cult and that isn't ok that isn't a joke or something to mess around with . We have lost so many people so many broken families because of this disease instead of showing someone that the disease killed let's show hope let's show we care about others the world needs more love and support of the fellow human being
no logan
No Logan means better YouTube
Stop whining kid
First Pewds, and now Logan Paul. Wonder what Youtube's going to be forced to do this time (to screw content creators even more).
Leave that man alone..he made one mistake ...get off his nuts
*OH NO THE ADPOCALYPSE JUST GOT MORE BURNING FUEL*
THEN *COOL IT DOWN*
chizzy Logan Hasn't  made videos in a week
With I ain't ganna say nothing adopt that you are right that's no good ;-;
chizzy I know right
chizzy I
:) you cancer Logan , you found the dead body and just laughing at him ??? , you should go die in hell
Oh he's done 
I hate this guy.
Fuck!!!
I am going to unsubscribe to Logan. This was very rude of him. Sorry don't cut it.
15 million followers
BRUH. ITS CALLED SUBSCRIBERS HIS IS YOUTUBE NOT INSTAGRAM
You know its the same thing right?
Belle Cat who fucking cares?
in some hot water bitch thEFUCJ
My best friend committed suicide, this made me sick
Logan Pauls career wont end cause his 10 year old fans dont know shit
There parents will be fucking pissed though.
Victor Barrientos it will if he goes to jail, what he did is illegal over there.
I hope he gets haunted
Already 2018
oh no... he is stuffed
And yet pewdiepie saying the N word got more media coverage than this...
just white
god damnet
Correction *SUBSCRIBERS*
WHY IS THIS DISLIKE?
The adpocolips is here
I have no idea who this guy is. But I have to say this is a horrible report. Im looking for  hes video right now, but you guys sadly are kicking a man while hes down. Good job.
Eric Belec Sorry but 22 is not a kid. Not by any means. 22 is old enough to know how to talk about suicide and he clearly didn't put much effort into actually approaching the subject in a respectful manner.
Ali. B. Nothing wrong with the head of mine. He fucked up and 22 is still a kiddo. Just look at him.
Eric Belec Really? Really? You feel bad for the 22 year old ADULT who made a conscious decision to post a video acting inappropriately and showing a dead body? He is the one who we should feel sorry for? What's wrong in that head of yours.
Really?
Kick off to 2018
who would win 
one angry social activist 
one paulie boi
Yes they call it the Jedi.
great start to 2018
Thank god the news is getting in on youtubes idolized cancer
I don't care
Ok seriously, be honest he did it for views. He only apologized because of the backlash. He didnt give a second thought about it. Suicide should not be messed with, him trying to say it was for suicide prevention is just making him look like more of an idiot than he already is
Oh no now the media is getting involved
fucking moron
Terrible start to 2018
its disgusting he even thought of going there as a JOKE. SUICIDE IS NOT A JOKE. You cant raise awareness by disrespecting the man that they did find by exposing his body, who had just committed suicide. He's a disgusting excuse for a human and deserves no second chances. If you follow him, please cut him off from your social media. He doesn't deserve attention.
Exactly
I know someone who was a big Logan Paul supporter and with suicides there is a copycat affect where seeing Suicide can push someone Having issues to do the wrong thing and because of seeing that vlog he did it. RIP mark. Help spread the word!
Eli A I've read this already.
Well, 2018 is going great so far...
Never heard of him.
Nooooooo he is becoming Jake Paul 
Laughing at a fucking dead body and making light of the situation is in no way encouraging suicide awareness or prevention. If he's doing anything he is glorifying suicide and selling it as a joke. SUICIDE IS NOT A JOKE.
That women in the back grinning like
I seen this on the news when I was leaving for school my grandpa was watching it
NO NO NO PLS DONT KICK HIM OFF OF YOUTUBE PLS HE DIDNT  KNOW HOW TO REACT. PLS SONT GET ANGRY AT HIM HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO. HE REGRETS PUTTING THIS VIDEO ON
15 followers online..........
ITS FOKIN SUBSCRIBERS
Ill kill my self if I had 10 million subscribers of nothing but little kids
He's a total moron, even before this.  He's not funny.
He makes money thanks to other morons watching his garbage.  You don't have to be smart to make money.
Yes,i understand that what he did was wrong.yes,he should have stopped recording.no,i am not defending him.i just want to say that everyone makes mistakes.he said himself that during that situation he did not know how to react.if i was in that situation i wouldn't either!!.suicide is nothing to take lightly,and is a serious serious topic and is not to be played with.people go through depression and all kinds of illnesses.
Such a fucking dipshit
LOGAN PAUL HAS BEEN SHOT BY THE MEDIA!
Why just why
What are followers its not insta its youtube on youtube its called subscribers
Jackluck2 ohhhh
There the exact same thing, they just say followers to not confuse their older audience that are familiar with the term
when she said 15 million FOLLOWERS on youtube...*screams in irratatement*
POR FAVOR DEJEN DE JODERLO, NO LO PUTEEN MS, YA PIDI DISCULPAS DE LO QUE HIZO BASTA
PARENTS! If you're watching this apology and believe this "apology", don't. Its bs and this isn't the only bad thing about the Paul Brothers: they have manipulated their fans (could be your own children) into the bubble of their fandom. The mindset of these kids who follow make Paul idolize them and treat them like gods, from buying overpriced merchandise in order to fit, to other malicious ideas that could effect an impressionable mind. Don't let your kids watch him.
Wow Logan messed up severely
The fact that they only said it was a reality check is ridiculous. They didnt mention so many of the things in the video and even said he eligibly but the dead body in the video when he actually did, he shot, edited, and posted a video that contained him laughing and smiling about a man that had taken his own life recently. Thats so beyond messed up that its so hard to believe.
What a piece of shit, and what a damn piss poor apology
I think this has all been blown out of proportions. There wasn't really anything THAT wrong with Logan's vlog. The harm was already done, all he did was adress the problem and sure it could have used a bit more censorship but it all seemed heartfelt and I don't see how that can be frowned upon so much. He didn't even reveal the identity of the person or show his face. The world isn't nice or fair. Suicide shouldn't be a taboo subject. We all make mistakes, his life is just literally broadcasted on the internet for all to see so his errors are also shown too, it's easy to juge others when they can't see your own faults, isn't it? He did something that may be frowned upon, but he did what he could to rectify that: he deleted the vlog and apologized wholeheartedly. Besides, if we don't talk about suicide and depression, we are all ignorant people who refuse to face reality. This serious matter is very important to understand and discuss. He may not have reacted exactly as he should have, but what makes you all so sure you would have done any better than him in that scary and uncertain situation? One action does not define who you are. Stop spreading the video again and encouraging hate. This being said, let's all stop being butthurt idots and move along with our lives, focussing on much more pressing issues than an otherwise great vlogger's little lapse in jugement. Thank you all for your attention, I wish you all the best of luck, let us learn from others' errors and try to do better.
whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cares
2017: hollyweed
2018: Logan Paul
Fuck Logan Paul. Hes a piece of shit meat head. Samson Norris
well, 2018's gonna be great....
He's not getting any endorsement deals anytime soon #facts
This is going to be an unnecessary rant but I really need to get it out:
Its so unbelievably unfair how there are  so many hard working people out there who are barely surviving on minimum wages who literally dedicate their lives to what they love, then there are assholes who make a fool out of themselves and disrespect others that earn millions of dollars.
Bloody reality.
Erik Hess fact
he used to get endorsements around the time of vine, I don't think he has got any in months
I will shred you in that argument #FAXX
This is why I was always a Jake Pauler.
Actually... I've seen a video with a dead body on it. Idk if it is suicide though.
Just like what David So said Logan ass will probably do a huge donation trying to cover up his snake personality #loganthesnake
How the fuck is this a growing up experience? He's twenty fucking two. These anchors or journalists should be condemning this shit instead of being so passive
O shit jack bad nabber login death
Didnt Black Mirror predict this whole Logan Paul debacle.  There are a few episodes that relay the dangers of going too far for likes and views.
I hate when people be over using "his a human we all make mistakes" can y'all just Please  find another excuse for his actions  instead of using does 7 words
We were supposed to leave the Pauls in 2017 but its only the second day of the new year and were already back on our old shit. Smh
Fuck I just bought his merch.
So you adults called "Abc" had to do a freaking rant about it? I get it your upset with Logan, but back off got it? Logan is trying to help stop suicide not make it worse. Act like an Adult, and leave the problem to Logan and His Logang not you and your gray hair. At least Logan tries to make things better.
Why didn't Youtube take the video down like they do to conservatives on a daily basis.
My fucking god 2018 is not even 2 days Im and this bull shit is all over the internet
I feel bad for him...
https://youtu.be/SEfMHw8kNtQ
I didn't even watch the video when I saw it trending because I knew that if it was real that he was an absolute disgusting asshole. I don't know why people clicked on it.
I didnt do it for views ok sure Ill buy that.
ALANI UNDERWOOD I have a life... but I respect your opinion anyway I guess
DANIELLE I agree but I could still see him begging for views though honestly  to some people, u can never have enough money honestly
Wilson Rosa ikr 
Bekah Stone lol chill dude
Cheyenne Hayden EXACTLY!
Logan sucks
#fuckloganpaul
Finally somebody who hates logan -.-
#fuckloganpaul
omg yes
Plz don't ban him 
I wanna go to the suicide forest XD
https://youtu.be/Xpel1CAtJ2k
I has seen it already
Fuck Logan
HE DID DO IT FOR VIEWS!!!HE DOES EVERYTHING FOR BIEWS. Hate that disrespectful monster
Go away Logan Paul.
No Way..??
Now peaole  hate logan Paul  instead of Jake Paul?
2018 is not lookin good..
another stupid american  ... shit
His face was pixelated doe
Leve Logan alone
Logan 4 life
IM A LOGANGSTER IM SO SRRY LOGAN RIP MAVERICKS
Logan Paul ruined my year
I thought we were Maverick 
he has a I'm sorry video if you watch him at all ur just a hater just like the rest he even blurred his face out and that sorry letter you got was not real so go and go to his channel and watch his I'm sorry video you haters
I saw it unfortunately:I
there not followers
Oohhhh NOOOOO not the LOGANG
Get this sicko off youtuble
This is sad, so many kids look up to this guy. No kid should see a dead body especially when a 22 year old grown man is chuckling next to it. The apology letter was bullshit and was probably written by his manager or someone else, it obviously  wasn't written from the heart and the fact that he has "I didn't do it for views, I get views" is so sickening to me. All these people defending Logan know that he was wrong for that.
People click bate that so people would watch it he finds a person on accident and now there doing this that's funny just because he's big
Great
Check your white male privilege bro
Hearing normies report shit is so funny. How does Abc even exist anymore
honey no !!!!!!!!!!!
What a POS Logan Paul is
wowwwww that's just disgusting
them haters be a maverick
pugrilla the legend why are you still in the logang? hes a horrible person for doing this.
lmaodrewww I AGREE WITH THE NEWS LOGAN SHOULD NOT FILM THE DEAD BODY AND HE SHOULD CUT THE SINCE WHEN THE DEAD BODY FILMS IN VLOG but im still a Logang (kinda)
pugrilla the legend im just saying... you should know that they both only want money.
lmaodrewww dont call me an immatured asshole or a 12 y/o
lmaodrewww WHY I JUST SAID I LOVE THEM WHATS WRONG
*Original* *Video* *Here*
 Viewer discretion is advised
Logan paul is not bad he made a mistake
Logan is Innocent he didn't know the body was there
something wrong with this logon paul
His excuse is full of shit just like his brother
The Paul Brothers are both idiots. 
They're too young, with too much money and exposure.
Then in his apology he Humble Brags.
I weep for our youth.
News just wants to get views for blaming famous people for views. I mean that is ok I have suicidal thoughts and depression but I'm ok with it
Uh oh Logan Paul um good luck in prison
Nnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooo not you tooooooo sttttttooooooooppppppppp stttttttoooooopppppp
This was all under Trump's tenure. Its all Trump's fault.
u have no idea how bad this year will be....with the media and manipulation and you all will be fooled
Hes not dong that  and he blurred the guys face off  you guys just want money
these people moaning about what happened but then think about other people in the world that costantly joke over the Internet death and hanging. about in college or work people joke costantly about suicide...... stop judging  this guy
Gosh he's an idiot
This is bullshit he clearly didnt mean it the way the internet is making it seem
This guys and idiot he apologuzed saying he was trying to create positivity how in the hell would this cause any positivity he's such a liar hes messed up and doesn't want to admit to it
This is promoting his pathetic ass more than shaming him..
Apparent
Fake News ABC. There is nothing apparent there, you see the dude hanging from the tree in at least seven different shots, with him literally going in front of the man.
2:16 Man In window Just standing there Lol
allegedly no he for sure did do that.
This might cause Logans channel to be deleted
Wow everone takes this the WRONG WAY he didnt know... 
Fuck this 
Just stop 
I feel sorry for this country if this dude is what kids like to watch ....
NEW YEAR NEW YOU.
People! Let this be a lesson to all of us. Never do something so stupid it compromises your money. Logan is rolling in cash and this stupid mistake will cost him millions. Its just not worth the risk. He had a great opportunity many of us would love to have. You have to be aware that ppl are waiting for you to slip up to tear you down.
ABC news is full of hypocrisy. Making fun of dead people is what ABC loves to do.
abc really now everyone will hate him and might kill himself because of you and the haters
Allegedly? Cuz Im pretty sure he actually did..
The original video is gone, but every single person that is sharing clips is jusy as crummy, if not MORE crummy than Logan.
Idk why they making a big deal outta this I mean YouTube had people getting shot and they worry about this?!
Guys hes learned his lesson!I hate 2k18 ily Logan Paul you make my life so much better from watching you and you inspire me SO MUCH
logan is a wanker
American people always like that!! Rude and noisy
He did it knowing  what he did. WOW
he's a total bad influence...
I'm so sorry for Logan but seriously?.......I never saw the vid but I saw the clips where he made fun of that corpse and it was so disrespectful but he probably is gonna take his life now great way to start the year
ALANI UNDERWOOD hes 22 years old. A grown ass man. Youre most likely too young to fully understand the situation so when youre like 16 or 17 come back to this and realize how you look right now defending his little feelings like if your sad bros like wtf hes ridiculous
Arii'Aunna Oh boy...The family already saw it. They were devestated when they saw and heard a video showing their child's body being shown to the entire world. There was also a cop when they left.
ALANI UNDERWOOD yes he has feelings but he acted completely heartless when he showed a deceased man what if the wife and child of that man saw this on youtube? And saw people defending him? How would you feel if that was one of your relatives
Stop he has feelings like everyone one else here or is everyone a heartless son of a bi***
Tomoko Tomoko why would a man who laughs at suicide victims commit suicide? He exhibits evil behavior, his apology was filled with crocodile tears. He's probably using this situation to get his rocks off because he's a rich white guy and knows that he's never going to face consequences for his actions.
In many eastern cultures, It is widely believed that even after the death of the physical body the spirit of the person doesnt leave the mortal world. it wanders around trying to make sense of the afterworld. Logan Paul is a horrible human being to afflict pain on this guy even after his death. If i ever see him and his motley crew in NYC, I'll spit on them. Shame on him+his friends and their parents on raising such monsters. totally lacking in empathy (surprisingly even the girl was smirking in the whole video). narcissictic group of people.
I watched the video while it was active
Love Paul is fucking idiot. He's just doing it for views and money. All the people are doing it to be famous and get views and make money. I shouldn't say all, maybe some people. But I've notice lately people putting stupid shit on YouTube to get money and views. I know they want to change people's lives and help.  But some of them are going for wrong reason .  To the peoe who actually inspire people on YouTube. Change people's lives. Good on you. Logan  You need to grow up.
15 million followers on YouTube
Oh, adults. You are so naive when it comes to social media
Fuck you
you stupid snowflakes....who cares about this? a body, omg big deal.  there is big news and you fools care about this.
Random frog The overall treatment of women in an Islam theocracy (which is to be expected) such as being forced to wear a hijab and treated as second class citizens since the Islamic revolution.
LeBron James what are they protesting?
MAGA oh no someone super famous showed something that could impact someone's fucking life. Fuck if it was Kyle Jenner everyone would be telling her to hang herself bit because you stupid 12 year olds think Logan is god can't see how fucked this shit is
Random frog Iran women protest? How immigration is raising terrorism in Europe?
Logan es el mejor
Wow.... I just came from Logan's apologie and now this??
OK people even though Logan made a mistake you don't have to put him down cause that can cause him to feel bad about himself and he could go into depression and possibly coming suicide see all these news people are doing is talk bad about youtubers how about everyone talk bad about them and let them know how it feels and if Logan does commit suicide then everyone will blame it on them OK so I'm apart of the logang I love Logan even though he makes mistakes I still stay with him and I don't turn against him I mean everyone makes mistakes every youtubers can't have a life like normal people because stupid paparazzi and news cast follow them if we could be put in youtubers or famous people's shoe and see what they go through we would die so leave him alone I'm OK he made a mistake but you do too so stop showing hatred towards him I mean I always will love Logan so stop plz just let it go logang I know he messed up but you do too so don't turn against him and Logan if your reading this I will never turn against you I love you so bye
Yeah the reason that it hasn't happened on youtube to anyone ever is because of the fact that even if it has to youtubers who are dumb enough to go into a place called the SUICIDE FOREST they won't actually post the content because they aren't THAT desperate for views...
He made a mistake jesh
Reality check? Lol. All your doing is helping him and making him more money. Fake news bulkshit.
Logan will never forget this and everyone will talk about this everyday until it slowly fades away
They always talk about the bad but left out the good he said... typical new right?
This guy needs shot
I actually hate Logan Paul after seeing this video
He said that making jokes and smiling is how he copes with things. There is Worse things that his world needs to worry about and we are worrying about this? Honestly ? Like wow.
His new years revolution should be to become a better person
Listen up people! He apologized. Link to the video right here. https://youtu.be/QwZT7T-TXT0
Wtf I have always wanted to punch him in his   face  he is shit never liked his ass anyways
WOW YOU GUYS REALLY HOLD GRUDGES LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS? LOGAN MADE A MISTAKE AND DIDNT KNOW HOW TO REACT SO HE LAUGHED!!!! I WOULD TOO! YOU GUYS ARE SOOO STUPID ACTUALLY!!!!!!!!!
OMG LOGAN O DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD GO THIS FAR
Haha its true this is the first time one actually founded a body on YouTube. Most videos on YouTube on the forest dont ever find a body so seeing one finally I was like about Time I thought it was fake for a moment there
here comes the adpocalypse 3.0
William Johnson lol
ABC news
It's not just posted a video he laughed about a person who committed suicide
He can't apologize, he fucking laughs in the video about the dead guy
World hate him now
you cant tell anyone what to do
KH Ed!ter yeah the feminists pussified world, sure.
In my country, they don't even recognize the Pauls.
Trancer T lol
Bro retarded 8-14 year olds will still support him
ABC is owned by Disney. Disney created Logan Paul. Good work Disney, now you can monetize the controversy as well as the suicide victim.
BTW Thanks for effing up Star Wars.
For him publicity good or bad is what he's looking for.  More clicks.  Now people who didn't know him, know him now.
I don't give a shit fuck you all
Fuck Logan paul
"He's only 22" yet he still has the mentality of a 5 year old.
And yet he still has his channel and nothing will happen it's all about the money
no harm but this is so stupid
he is so full of it  he doesn't care
Logan u suck any loser 
 why do people think LP (Logan Paul)did this for views..... sad just sad 
Julie The Fox if he knew how bad it was in the first place he shouldn't have uploaded it and made the dead body the fucking thumbnail
Julie The Fox Im happy someone is agreeing with me
Lol he makes alooooot of money and gets loooooots of Views but yeah this is sad lol you guys are a trip
Your kid's role model, people.
The fact that YouTube videos get demonetized for one swear word and that video, that man, gets to make millions is sick. YouTube has become twisted like every other social media site. YouTube, step it up, now.
Bro I feel bad about Logan since he put that video on there he is being hated by a lot of people if he had never put that video on there people would of still loved him no hated.
But I have to say RIP random person
I just wanna say, it is possible for someone to laugh and smile when seeing something like that. It's a reaction from shock, it's a thing, some people do it even if they don't necessarily mean to. I doubt he actually expected to turn around and see a actual dead body, or at least not in plain sight so to speak. So while, yes, it looks bad, just know that when someone is surprised, in shock, etc. they may smile and or laugh, make jokes, whatever.
Im fucking tired of this how many youtubers need to address this issue????????? 10+ people Im subscribed to have addressed this thing . I only have TWENTY subscribes to other you tubers. Like honestly 10 videos about the subject is way more then needed but considering Im barely subscibed to anyone its just fucked up. They say Logan Paul did the dead body video for views but literally every single you tuber is taking advantage of the subject for VIEWS THEMSELVES! And did anyone realize there was like 250k likes and 3k dislikes right before any celebrities started dissing Logan for showing the body? Crazy how this world works
Fuck all you Sensitive ass lil bitchs.
What a piece of shit
"Youtube star" 
More like joke
Logan Paul laughed at the situation. How is that raising awareness!?
Hes done.... REJOICE REJOICE
Well he fucked up
atleast it wasnt clickbate
I don't even watch him but damn..good way to start 2018.
15 million followers one YouTube...
*Isnt subscribers?*
He didn't show the fucking body damn stop being dramatic seriously y'all should stop your career not him 
Fucking millenials.
I'm sorry but we have people (hundreds) killed by terrorist, and this gets more air time than that. I totally do not agree with these actions, but people make mistakes. He apologized and he has done everything he can do. He is still a perso, give the man a break
He looks like the jerk from Karate Kid.
That lady even said he apologized!!!
Lmao. Hopefully this is the downfall of both him and his shitbag brother. Tired of them stinking up this site.
IVE HAD IT NOW
im a fan but i did not like the laughing it me want to kill myself more then i already want to
#takedownhischannel
this really made me mad because i myself suffer from depression. 
He obviously did it for views, did anybody else  look at the thumbnail he had,it had the body blurred out so people would click on it... smh
Hes now the most talked about YouTuber.
he said sorry
His brother overstayed at the white house yet he never apologized for that
Wow,what a fucking start for 2018
0:20 *last year
Ah, what a great day to start 2018!
White privilege boys are always full of shit inside. No surprise there.
Everyone has 2 die gosh
Woww Great wayy to start 2018This bullshit
This video was so fucked up that Logan made it on ABC News
I want him to leave japan
15 mill SUBSCRIBERS not followers
Suicide forest vs. Social Suicide, oh the irony.
Davi Togoro I know . I thought maybe people would see his true colours but no .Theyre all brainwashed 7 year olds who havent gotten the message
The sad thing is he is only growing from this. His mindless cancerous fan base don't care and have already forgiven him.
Elias Yourmom vvnigga
He even shouts like hes juped up on steroids hitting the jack pot full of money
This isn't the end or fall for him lmao. He's passionate about what he does and won't let non sense drama ruin it for him. If this wasn't either of the Paul brothers, no one would know that someone recorded a dead body and uploaded it. Paul bros for the take over ESKIITTTT
Fail it's not followers on youtube it's subscribers
This little puke bag is just another example of what's happening in society. it makes my stomach turn. There is no respect, no dignity, No Love anymore.
Bitch how was it an "apparent" suicide victim.....how much more fuckin apparent does it need to be
Oh shit... this is bad
This is beyond bad. This crossed a line. A line of respect for the dead.
Very good
Number 56: Junglezone ikr
Zachary Lukhezo good
Oh fuck.
HE SAID SORRY
I understand this was wrong... very WRONG. But this will haunt Logan for life.... he will be followed by his nightmares..
And sadly enough he will get even more "followers" after this.. His statement made NO sense..hes not sincere... How disrespectful if it were his family hanging there im positive he would of dropped any or all cameras right there!!What a circus smuck :/
"you may not know your kids is watching this guy" Me:me that means you watched it to know this :)
OMG THEYRE NOT FOLLOWERS THEYRE SUBSCRIBERS OMG YOUR TRIGGERING ME
Here he goes again!
22 is a legal age to go to prison
Its only the start of the year and its already getting intense
"A growing up experience"
Yeah I remember my first time filming a dead body for entertainment. A lot of people were mad at me but then some shitty news station defended my actions and I knew everything would be all right.
Are you fucking kidding me
He's gonna get more hate then Jake Paul (I think..., I'm not sure) but what he did is stupid af
I hate the news
adpocalypse 3.0 lets go -_-
In 2018 can we please just ban idiotic content on YouTube forever ?
You guys really need to stop going on about it! Its all OVER!
He is sorry.
No it makes him look like a fool, I don't watch his content but still. And don't give " oh but he's 22" suck it up!! He made a fucking grave mistake!! He's going to live with it!!
Im glad he wasnt in my childhood 
ThomasM Honestly I hated those Disney sitcoms when I was a kid and stuff so the Paul brothers are and forever will be two disrespectful idiots in my eyes.
He said sorry
Rue Paul is a reflection of North American society, its sated, apathetic, stupid, petty with no empathy...did I miss any other descriptors in there?  That's why he is a matinee YT star.
he disgusts me
Leave logan alone assholes
*I SAW THIS ON THE NEWS ON MY OWN TV*
End the paul brothers , yall brainwashed
KICKSARE LIT dumb fucking kid
Mary Lee Right? My sister got mad at me because I hate him now, well I hated him before, but now I hate him 100%
KICKSARE LIT disgusting.
KICKSARE LIT ladies and gentlemen, this is the people who watch Logan Paul. Let that sink in, I'm kind of glad you toxic, vile and disgusting viewers watch Logan and Jake Paul instead of actual good cotent makers. I wouldn't want you tarnishing them.
Here comes the irony because maybe you wouldn't be acting like that if you didn't watch the Paul brothers.
KICKSARE LIT stop
He didnt do it for awareness, he started laughing at the end. This is not ok.
The reason why he was laughing because he didnt know how to react.Still think hes a dick though
Yeaaahh fuck logab
The main point was unmentioned.. the thing that outraged people is his disturbing, disgusting tradition to the dead body. He may be the most popular, but also the most ignorant and obnoxious person on YouTube.
I just want to let everyone know that your life is more valuable than you could possibly understand, no matter how many times people laugh at you, no matter how many times you're made fun of, you are more beautiful than you could possibly understand, when people are mocking your dreams, you need to be conquering them. Stay strong, and never give up.
Logan is great he's awesome and he is also helping suicide prevention
So disappointed with him
Holy S*** this is going viral around youtube!
we all know that logan did it for views
Where the video ?!?
How did his video even get approved and uploaded by youtube?
Oh my lord...
He literally killed his YouTube career
R.O.T.C SEEM look at his social blade
Killerfoxy Foxy yes
No need for iDubbbz now.
R.O.T.C SEEM Nope MSM did a report on Jake Paul and his views and subs are still skyrocketing nothing will kill his YouTube channel.
Maybe WSJ could idk
Yato!
DAB ON EM HATERS
You all just love talking about how much money they make don't y'all.
Get his ass
Idiot
Hey Logan Paul! Stop polluting Japan and the world with your shit! Youre lucky I didnt run into you when you were over here. Keep that shit in America.
I love his vlogs but Logan why tho...
Not going to hurt him at all he still has 15m subscribers nobodys unsubbing
EGO ALERT IN APOLOGY.
Tf I hate Logan Paul, but even I think everyone is taking his too far. at the end of the video Logan explains how it was a coping mechanism that was triggering is reaction. He even explains how suicide was a serious thing and that he was not mocking it.
But there's other fuckin people that went to the place and was showing fucking bodies like what the fuck yall like I said there is other ppl going to the place and posting videos of dead bodies from that place but yall not doing this to them,just him like yall petty but my rant is done bye
His career is offically over  sad to see him do this
Kiss your career goodbye, logan!!!!!
+ALANI UNDERWOOD 
ALANI UNDERWOOD thats weird
Trancer T wtf lol
ALANI UNDERWOOD you gonna cry now?
this has nothing to do with any of this logan controversy but ,you would suck a dog's penis rather than a human's penis?
i made a video on my channel about this check it out
His money has nothing to do with this people always what to tie money to anything bad. What the fuck does the fact that he drives a nice car have to do with anything? Hes the same asshole rich or poor I hate how our culture demonizes money. Thats why everyone is so damn broke. Nothing wrong with money folks everyone should get rich.
You are a news channel... This is immature of you to be posting about this.... You dont have nothing netter to talk about?? You just are exploiting it even more
Thats... the point of the news channel?
And it's very mature to post a dead body?... Sure thing 
Slime Blue Logan Paul*
Jake Paul showed a bunch of young teens a dead body. That's definitely going to make the news.
th3dark pr1nc3 Yea they report news... this is blowing up so they're reporting on it??? Any reason they shouldn't report it?
He tried to make something good everyone took it the wrong fuckin way
No sad
Logan Paul I love you but Im disappointed 
Bull, we saw what you are capable of, your words mean nothing because your actions differ. You are sorry because you see now that there are consequences.
I'm sorry but I had a really bad day and I'm gonna start having to wach jake Paul if logan won't post any vlogs. it's just, I get really grumpy on bad days AND I liked logan a lot. so I'm kinda mad but I'm just gonna put that aside for now. I'll tell this to my future kids though
how about you just go away
Mr. Man Guy You support this person, c'mon there are people far more worthy that don't get the recognition they deserve. How about you go support someone like Malala.
um I'm sorry but who's the one talking?
Mr.Man Guy We'll see once the day you die and everyone laughs about it. You are a dumbass.
@ABC NEWS stop spreading this around to the whole wide world then if yall think kids shouldnt watch Logan
Logan isn't evil he apologized I forgive him he loves everyone!!!!
I do not want to  Logan come to Japan. He is rude and troubleing. Never come to Japan!!
N nana too late :(
2018 needs to end the Paul brothers...
LEAVE HIM ALONE GUYS GIVE HIM A 2ND CHANCE
Well, they failed to mention that he was laughing about the 21 yr old kid that had just hanged himself a few hours before he found it, He needs to be removed from youtube
Poor Logan
Wow, even ABC made a headline of his dumbassery?!...logan sure better change from this.
I personally really like Logan Paul. But if you're gonna hate on him for this I don't bland you. This was pretty messed up.
God Logan you are a disappointment  meant to Youtube
To YouTube? He is a Disappointment to the fucking world!
Also his brother too
'i didnt do it for views i get views'
Omg I knew he would do this
Lowgang4life
And I thought Justin Bieber was bad, Jesus Christ how can people do this?? This is sick
Dude. people post inside suicide forest all the time. calm yo tidnips. Duh suicides bad but jeez leave the po boi alone.
Yes and Logan Paul did talk about Suicide prevention.
She makes it sound ok to hate because he has a nice car!!!!!
Stop talking about Logan poul 
50 million followers...
*thank you abc news thank you!*
Mr. Man Guy  for proving that logan is a jackass
for what
I just hope this does a whole lot of damage to him that should of been done before!!
jake lee yes it would be better if he voluntarily left this career than being banned trying to save it.
Killerfoxy Foxy  well i hope he ends his career:)))
Killerfoxy Foxy hes done so much harm and so much wrong
Killerfoxy Foxy why cause your a fan?
Hailz7_SOLDIER I hope not
Logan stated in the video that some people deal with death differently, and he had never actually seen a dead person before, and so he was trying to 1) lighten the mood and 2) it was just nervous laughter. Sometimes when people are scared, or nervous, they have bad habits. Logan was just trying to make the best of the situation. He never intended to see a dead person in the forest, as he stated.
Clearly an example of someone who has lost touch with reality.
You just ruined his youtube  career
This looks like a parody.
Now it is on abc , damn...
Its not just Logan Andy Altig posted the body on his channel also. Boy Andy is lucky he doesn't have more subscribers
Wow Logan is on the news now
What the fuck is the problem with showing dead people. It's a thing, people die everyday, the media shows dead people, especially in third world countries like it's nothing.
Giving him publicity by saying hes the top entertainer. Fuck that, he is no such thing. May this mark the end of his AND Jakes career.
HuBBLe BrAg (+_+)
Way to start off 2018 Logan Paul smh
SHUT UP ABC NEWS I LOVE LOGAN GET A LIFE LOGAN RULES HE HAS TWICE AS MANY SUBS THAN YOU PEOPLE DO STUIPD THINGS HE DIDNT UNDERSTAND
Then again its a big ass sin IF YOU KIll YOUR SELF im not aginst any of this put it was justa stupid mistake that logan did.
100% Did it for views. If he even tried doing it for "awareness" he wouldn't be laughing  and smiling and joking in the video. He wouldn't of posted a video basically parading around a poor dead mans body. I'm 21 and no one has to tell me not to do that. Don't even dare try to excuse him because of his age.
allegedly showing the body? wtf!
*Logan suicide: ****https://youtu.be/AmqB1uFGlpo*
Random frog
Nope this is a term thay only white ppl get
He did not show the body
He fucked up and he surrounds himself with mostly yesman that are like "yeah sounds like a great idea". Diuchebag of the year
It's a dead body. In a public place. Who freaking cares. 
If he didn't go out acting like an idiot he wouldn't have found it to notify authorities. IDIOTS!
Why is this all over the news damn!
What he did was disgusting
This dude makes too much ad revenue for youtube. Nothing will happen to him.
Logangg fuck you news /// lil pump now Logan
Just calling him names isnt making this any better, yall giving him the attention he wants
Seriously. What is wrong with people? Why would you do that... Honestly. I used to kinda like him but now. Pfff he can stuff his videos up his butt.
YOU CANNOT BRING SUICIDE AWARENESS THIS WAY. This is disrespectful to Japan! Use some common sense
Well he did it again, he got what he wanted, y'all talking bout him, & he's right whether he do it for attention or not he still going to get views....
I have a feeling this will not be Logan's best year
*Any one else cringe a little inside when she said followers on YouTube instead of subscribers*
Anakin Jared Im not heartless,  Im completely disgusted. I hate Logan. I already commented paragraphs bashing 12 year olds who still like him.
Deadpan Drip lmfao. 
Anakin Jared -_- it was a joke comment
Carolyn me
People calling subscribers followers is pretty normal
Logan Paul is trash, he will always be trash, anyone who thinks otherwise is a fucking lunatic.
15mil followers good job 2018
Logan Paul gets all the hate he does not deserve it he didn't no that he was going to run into the body he didn't no what to do stopping hating him
Guy doesn't even care about the apology, only cards about the subs
I cant blame you, i put some hate on the vid too
No an apology doesn't change the fact he was disrespecting the person that choose to end his own life anyone that's sane would have went to get the cops so they could possibly I'd the person and do the rest that needs to be done he wasn't doing any good even my own mother says what he was doing go was wrong
Well at least now he knows where to go now that his career is ended.
This... this is the guy who represents YouTube... and Americans... we are fucking *doomed*
Culture plays an even wider roll in social media.
He did nothing wrong! "Generation of pussy's". (Clint Eastwood)
HE FUCKING TOLD IT WAS IN THERE! NOW YALL CRYING YOU SAW IT?
Sure mistakes are mistakes, but that was the most stupidest mistake I've ever seen. Even younger kids know you don't record a DEAD MAN AND LAUGH ABOUT IT.
Is it bad that I'm wearing the same maverick sweatshirt in the vid??
Logan's house is 6 m dollars too
Logan>news
News person:Who has 15 million followers on you tube.                                Me: followers? ha! Don't you mean subscribers 
Well I hate Jake Paul but Logan is really nice he apologises and he takes down his vids that cause wronging, JAKE IS A REALLY FUCKED UP PERSON
He should apologize for that hat too.
i would wish for them to take a cultural approach like gajin goomba did
Logan did do something bad I know but I still dont hate him he's still cool and I love his videos and I always will
sophie turner knows Hollywood is full of baby sacrificing and cannibalistic satanic worshippers she should go to the forest and not return for being so fucking fake
Now Here  Logan Gets Maybe A Boot From YouTube
The news twisted everything
Suicide is an epidemic and he did go about bringing awareness in the wrong way. But awareness does need to happen. People need to start talking about it so that we can try to prevent it.
Just delete this video will you, stop being pathetic. He has ways of dealing with things, in awkward situations i laugh too we cant help it so stfu and delete the video.
How can you sit there saying he apologized so move on  due to that video its gotten so much hate and his apology video I feel wasnt sincere I mean he is an actor and has been in many movies it could all be a publicity stunt like he went there he went to that forest what did he think he was going to find its called suicide  forest its sad to know people are defending this guy
did they say "suicide victim"? How is that? Some dumbass decides to take their own life, and they are considered a victim? Of who? Themselves? This is a perfect example of media being full of sh#t. Suicide is not a sickness, disease, or something somebody else can do to you, so you cannot be a victim of suicide. But saying so, sure makes the headline sound like "Awww, that poor guy, he just wanted to kill himself without being noticed" Such f#*king idiots.
Logan no how
Fuck off abc news
Ive been seeing lots of videos about this and it makes me so sad  thank u abc for hurting logan even more he deleted the video and he apologized god what else do u want 
Lots of videos say that Logan is ending YouTube and Im really sad
Yeah I'm sure by laughing about it and disrespecting a man who took his own life by filming him and constantly zooming in etc he was trying to raise awareness. Omg it's all a big misunderstanding he's such a good person haha we got mad about nothing haha chill everybody
Annnnnnd adocalypse 3.0
xbigEx nice high gold pic lad
xbigEx lol
xbigEx That's not autocorrect...
adpaulocalypse
Logan Paul does not need to be defended. What he did was wrong. He knew the risks when he uploaded the video.
Logan was being mindless
Not targeting teens or children but idiots
it truly scares me that an innocent child could have stumbled across the video and seen the dead body...
kay. Better hope they never play dead space.
When are we going to make these Paul brothers go the f*ck away
Well this isn't a surprise
This is a worthless infotainment show, which is obvious from their not-so-subtle awe at the expensive car this jackwad drives. Disgusting.
I hate the people that talk sh** about logan paul
maria guardado and we hate you too
LoGan PAul IS CAnCeR edit; Im so sorry, I didnt mean to offend you guys. I should have thought about it :(
you shold lit him vlog
look even u make mistakes like that
FICKITY FICKITY FACK IS REAL 
Cancer is not funny. But since many people replied that, might as well recommed a replacement:
Logan Paul is Fever
Agreed
Bethsaida Velasco exactly
Hahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahah omg I cant stop hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahha lmao
If Logan Paul keeps doing these *apologies*, he will lose his youtube channel.
this is irrelevant
I no its bad but Stopppppp
Oh what did he say????
Guy:one of the most popular stars"
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR STARS"
me:flips table*dumb ass thats PEWDIEPIE!
He really should have not have posted it sorry Logan
Like do. U really have to post it like really LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE stop drama god
I was watching the video and when she said Paul instead of Logan or  it REALLY PISSED ME OFF
Logan is so fucked 
Dude Paul ass nigga  ur ugly what happened if that was you hanging like and someone recorded your ass
He's got so much attention for this I'm starting to realize he's a genius
The media: Pewdiepie says a bad word "HE'S A NAZI, HE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM YOUTUBE. HOW CAN WE LET SUCH A HATEFUL PERSON INFLUENCE OUR KIDS!!!" Logan Paul films a suicide victim "This is certainly a growing experience for him..." Double standard much?
Harry Callahan yeah they really seem to love him for mocking suicide victims.
He made a mistake but hes only human
Booooooooooooo let Logan be different it's the maverick way
Stupid kid SMH
Any news show when talking about  YouTube star whether it between jake or Logan Paul ,reporters always focus on the negativity about almost every YouTube star instead of focusing and saying on what positive things they did over the year
Too many kid like this and they think its ok. Such a embarrassment to nation of Japan. Watch his rest of video guy acts like 6yo and they let him out of the house.
Fuck everybody how hates on logannnnnnn
He apologized
HE FUCKED UP HIS 2018 ....UGH HES TERRIBLE
I was laughing so hard this morning watching this. He deserved it.
1K 13 year old girls disliked this video.
These other guys on YouTube (TFIL) posted a video of them going into the suicide forest and they actually did see a dead body. But they didnt show the audience nor get closer to get a better look. The mood changed and they immediately left the area, so @ what Logan Paul did: Really?
Amanda Elmore "IM NOT UR DUDE, BRO" "WELL IM NOT UR BRO, MAN" "WELL IM NOT UR MAN, DUDE!!!!" Sorry, I just had to reference that lol. But ok, sorry I was kinda triggered and yea, it's all good...dude
Lucy McFadgen what the hell, dude?? I dont need to do any research on them if I was referencing ONE video I saw from their channel. Im not writing a news article on them. Think before you speak, yeah?
Amanda Elmore Nah, TFIL stands for "The Fuck It List" they have a list and they do all this crazy shit that's on it, like going to different countries. Research before you speak, yeah?
Arturo Benitez TFIL isn't trash. He often does exploting videos, but besides that he and his friends go to amazing places and vlog it. They're really interesting. I actually think it's one of the best channels on Youtube
AzZy76 but they thought they saw a dead body so their reaction and what they chose to do is whats important in this situation. Also I agree that Logan made a huge mistake posting that video especially what he put as his thumbnail. He shouldnt have even filmed when he saw something like that let alone post a video showing what he saw to kids who look up to him.
Boo you suck logan paul is awesome
#imalogangster and I watched the vid
You should sit in a corner and think about your life.
you're not a logangster,you're just a fucking moron
So stupid making it such a big deal.
also people are reuploading the video
Stop hating on Logan Paul please
XGlum DropsX yeah
I like how these replies are completely heartless. 
Who's the monster now?
Lucefurr after he dies
Lucefurr nope
People need to stop with the logan paul hate he did nothing wrong.
Why did he go to the suicide forest?
Ok maybe he made a mistake but he help and put a smile on my when no one else could
You aren't raising awareness if you're constantly laughing in the forest knowing what goes down there. These youtubers are all a bunch of douche bags
If he is in the suicide forest what if all this backlash will make him kill himself (I hate Logan Paul)
it wasnt his fault. omg
So sad , my doughter , its 8 yr old , she  showed to me,  the video on you tube , cant believed this guy did what he did !!!
Okay, Im writing this because Logans fans clearly dont understand how badly this man-child has fucked up, so allow me to educate you kids. He wasnt spreading suicide awareness and heres why: 
1. He included the dead body as a THUMBNAIL TO GET MORE VIEWS. It doesnt matter if he says I didnt do it for view, hes lying. All the guy cares about is views and popularity. I bet if no one gave him shit, he wouldnt have deleted that disgusting video.
2. This was a REAL, HANGING DEAD BODY. Do you understand that? A guy, who was suffering with many things in his life decided to end his life. I dont care if he blurred the body (kinda), a normal person with morals, would turn off that camera and contact authorities immediately. Not go closer and film the corpse. That is disgusting and disrespectful.
3. Logan and his friends were laughing and cracking jokes the whole time. If you say thats a way he copes with the sadness than thats bullshit. Would you go to a funeral and laugh and crack jokes? No. If one of your family members just died, would you make jokes? No. It doesnt matter if you know the person or not. You. Dont. Laugh. At. Suicide. Any person with morals knows that.
Logan Paul fucked up. It doesnt matter how many of his fans defend his actions. What he did was absolutely disrespectful, to that poor man and his family that are now suffering a loss. Logan shouldnt have used his corpse, the last thing that man will ever be remembered for, for views. Him demonetising and adding a disclaimer was obviously the only decent thing he did. However. Logans apology was half-assed and insincere. Any person with a brain would know that. Think again kids before you defend that man.
Omg everyone chill out enough people have came at them just leave him alone bigger stories out there
People are so sensitive to this why should he respect someone who was crazy enough to take their own life?
well it's the biggest one of 2018
Michigan Football Go Blue! 
So it's okay to talk about Trump and that crap but not about millions of children being shown footage of an actual dead body? I have no literal faith in humanity.
When did he laugh at the dead person if anything he said that was wrong that one of the people with him name Andy made a joke about it
Yeah he's a prick, but I just find it amusing that the people that hate him the most are the one's giving him the most attention and exposure.
Subscribers not followers
Logan 4 life fuck nbc
He said suicide is no joke
Logan Paul is an amazing guy. Everyone makes big mistakes and whether you guys believe he doesn't deserve views and likes, I believe he does. He stood up and apologised for the bad behaviour he had caused and I know he meant it.
gosh listen linda this never seen a dead body he didnt know how to react and he blured the dead bodys face . also logang supports him like if u agree.#logang4life
He did nothing so stop
Here we go again...
Logan Paul is a good and great influance to everyone that was just an accident
Allegedly? He fucking did show that damn dead body on a video
Why the hell is this being justified
Everybody makes mistakes ABC News calm your ass down everybody makes mistakes even you guys
Ignorance at it's finest.
who the hell is this guy? never heard of him until now.
Why doesn't ABC cover YT censoring conservative channels but letting this garbage stay on? As well as giving a happy place for pedophiles. Oh wait same libtard babyraping creeps run ABC as run Google. Answered my own question.
2018 looks great
Who else got triggered when they said 15,000,000 followers instead of subscribers
0:33 ?
when i got my notification from logan paul for that vid 
i didn't click on it cuz i just thought i was gonna be fake 
but then i saw the i'm sorry vid from him 
and my reaction WAS CRAZY
i started sweating and everything 
what's gonna happen to logan now??
will he still be the most popular youtuber??
or will the king fall??
These news things are making the persons death even worse then Logan did
Now I can't watch Logan thanks a lot.
HE NEEDS BANNED!!! IVE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING SO OBVIOUSLY WRONG JUS LET GO WIT ZEROOO PUNISHMENT!
Wait okay I'm confused. Was the body real orrr..?
It's not followers it's subscribers
I Respect ABC news. BUT he was very stressed and he didnt know wat to say. So somethin came out of his mouth. But he did not mean to say that. You know that right. How Dare You.
Its only the second day of the year. Some of the outrage on Logan is making a way more negative impact than his actual action. Social medias start towards positivity among everyone has taken a huge step back.
Facts Be Told lol does it fucking matter now that shit is old news move on and go make use of your new year
How many times are you gonna rephrase your shit ass comeback?
Jaana Viit clearly you dont understand my point. I never said anything about how what he did was wrong or right. I only focused on the fact that the effect from this whole situation is not being handled properly.
Leonardo da Vinci Im not defending him, no where did I say what he did was okay. Im referring to people take their time to comment insensitive things like you should be the one in that noose, which I have seen very frequently on several videos. And 1/3 of the trending page are videos on him. Which is giving more space for this damaging outrage. I am not defending him and he has already stated that others should not defend him.
Jonny morales you just dont seem to understand the absolute lack of human empathy and respect he was displaying.  If that was your family member hanging there in the tree would you understand??   That is a human being ... a soul who was struggling and went through a dark place...   this kid was too self involved and self centred to realise his own actions...   Do you understand it is a moral dilemma for our society if more and more young people are showing absolute detachment from humanity, love and understanding?    Then it will become an even crueler world than what we are living in already ...
why do they talk like were 7 years old
If he was really trying to raise suicide awareness, he went about it all wrong. Him and his friends were laughing in the video. If it was nervous laughter that could be read the wrong way, then he could have easily edited it out. He came across like the guy from Boston in that one viral video where he's freaking out over a sunfish. If you haven't see it, just look up Boston Sunfish.
Logan is mother f**CK
SUICIDE IS A JOKE NEED MORE SUICIDE
Feed the troll
Ray De La Garza Jr. hahaha, you're a joke
Ray De La Garza Jr. ITs  not
Esther173 S. IM REPORTING U
Just saying people who says he laughed at the body doesn't mean he was happy, I laugh and smile when I'm sad because that is how my body reacts to the emotion.
STOP IT STOP IT LOGAN PAUL IS AN INSPIRATIONAL GUY SO STOP DOING THIS YOU KNOW HOW SAD HOW CRUSHED HE IS HE'S DISAPPOINTED IN HIMSELF IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT JUST PUBLICITY OF SOMEONE BECAUSE YOUR FUCKING JOB YEA THE VIDEO WAS WRONG BUT WE ALL MAKE FUCKING MISTAKES OKAY WE ALL HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES WE ALL DO OKAY WE'RE NOT ALL MR.

Arii'Aunna oh I couldn't hear you cuz I said I wouldn't waste my time for your sorry ass so bye bye Adios
Sabrina carpenter is Queen and you think its best for him to raise awareness by showing the fucking body...yeah stfu dumbassi watched the entire vlog and all i received from it was a loss of brain cells and it seems you have too dumbass
Arii'Aunna If that's was my sister or brother I'll just be sad but I also want people to know that they should talk to their parents or an adult if they're thinking of suicidal or if they are in depression and Logan Paul did that didn't you watch the whole vlog nooo because you don't know the full story I in the other hand did watch the whole vlog so Shut the fuck up I'm not wasting my time for your sorry ass
Sabrina carpenter is Queen do you really think he gives a damn about you all? He showed all of his fans a dead body and tried to turn it into a joke yeah youre 14 but you need to grow the hell up if you honestly support something like this its disgusting...let me ask you.. if that was your brother... or sister or father ..how would you feel about logans reaction to seeing it? Come on now take your head out of your ass and realize that if he wasnt doing it for the views then why tf would he upload a video of a corpse? For awareness? Awareness of what? That suicide is real? As if people dont already know that. I understand him raising awareness but i dont understand him showing a recently deceased mans body who hung himself.
Irrefrangible stupidity... uncharacterised!!
HOLY SHIT THEY EVEN GOT THE NEWS ON THIS HOLY FUCK! ITS ONLY BEEN A DAY!
Whores
THIS FUCK ASS IN NIGGA MADE THE NEWS 
Poor Logan... I commented on his recent video on my opinion.
Shane Dawsons is jumping in joy
Must be a slow news day. ABC trying to take keemstars views.
U should forgive him ur all idiots if u don't cuase people make mistakes it's Part of being human we learn from our mistakes and Logan is only young he's still learning and he tried to make an awareness for suicide at the end of the video he put suicide numbers to call if ur depresses and along those lines so u should all forgive him
He will not be forgiving
I saw the video
I hate him. I know hate is a strong word but what he did was wrong, unacceptable, and disgusting. He was an idiot for posting that and the title too. Its stupid that his fans still support him and stand up for him. Like, wtf that is not okay. The fact that there are kids on YouTube and subscribe to him and all that is just. In my opinion its disgusting.
Way to start the year Logan.
end of 2017 
Logan: This was the best year of my life 
End of 2018
Logan:This was the worst year of my life
YouTube should shut Logan Paul down!
His apology was fake, it had no remorse in it.
Sick!
Ryan Do 
I see your side, and your right.
I'll just pray for him.
What else is there to do
God bless
Ryan Do 
I hope your right, but I'd much rather see him shut down
My point is this
https://youtu.be/erDd5jz7AL4
In his apology video he said very little about the dead guy or his family. As a matter of fact I don't recall him saying anything to that guy's family.
Logan Paul needs help!
Killerfoxy Foxy
His actions were unforgivable. Just because people have done worst DOESN'T justify his action.
St4r is was real and is was a mistake and what you have not seen worse or something I seen way worse then this
Its everyday bro!!!
You **** news
He says he didn't do it for views. Bullcrap. He 100% did it for the views
He's fucking 22, it's no "growing up experience". His dumbass should've known better, it was 100% for views. Unacceptable.
we will never let this go logan hahaha
So... is this how we start 2018?
I think people are over their heads I've seen videos of people getting their head cut off or face getting ripped off by cartels yet no one cares but one body on this video and is omg u all just sit down
Both brothers are fucked
Logan Paul is a dreamboat and I want to bare his children! Pop my cherry LP and spank me big boy!
Im srry but Im not on side I just know I kinda feel sick watching this video
Jacksepticye also dropped a tweet
He just started the new year correctly 
With this, ABC just raised awareness about Logan Paul and probably increased his view counts - exactly what he wants. Logan Paul is loathsome.
I forgive him
I dont feel bad for him
LETS ALL HOLD HANDS AND GO TO CHURCH BECAUSE THESE COMMENTS GOT ME SCREAMING FOR JESUS
The brainwashed kids that support him and basically the rest of humanity for a blessing
   the people who hates Paul or the one who defends him?
Everyone actually chill the fuck out. I understand that what he did wasn't right no matter what, but you can't use ur hate against Logan Paul to make the actions seem worse than what they were. He was trying to raise suicide prevention but that obviously backfired. Don't call me a fan boy because you're only proving my point. You're letting your hate for Logan Paul overcome the apology for the action itself.
Mina The Raichu he might Idk. He's probably get out of it, because I mean it wouldn't be a huge deal, I think its a minor crime. He could post bail, but he might lose a shit ton of money because he's gonna lose sponsors
Param Patil Can he go to jail then? Because he did break Japanese law.
YO! It's a dead body.. YOOOOOOOOO let's film it, grab that stick and poke it! COOOOOOOOL!
Mind your business screw the news
It's actually subscribers
he posted a reality USA live in a bubble people here are like programmed robots weird is called brain Wash
his fan base is mostly 10 year olds...and they are defending him, they probably don't know what suicide is. But they are so annoying in the comments with their stupid excuses
People are taking this to far. Like stfu theres worse shit happening in this evil world we live in. The dark web.   Humans getting tortured. Donald trump.  Way worse shit you see everywhere !!! Jeez way to start 2018 and everyone in the u.s has a heart attack about it.
Fucking dicks
AND HE ALSO FAKES A SERVICE DOG WHICH IS *FEDERALLY* ILLEGAL!  WHY ISN'T ANYONE STOPPING HIM FROM DOING THAT?  JESUS!  WHAT A PERSON CAN DO WHEN THEY HAVE MONEY AND A FAN BASE IS APPAULING!
Anum Bloodrose Which is sad!  Some of what these kids are posting is just as disgusting and alarming!  The generation we are raising today, I fear for the future!  And where are these kids parents and why are they not outraged at youtube?  Why is the internet parenting our children today?  And why is the family of this man not suing youtube?  I would!  They hand picked it for the trending page not once but multiple times.  It goes up for review and they hand rewiew it and turn it down and puts it back up on the trending page.  His bullshit "I'm so sorry" is on the trending page.  Youtube is not about "family friendly"!  They are all about money!  That is all it is, is money.  Demonitization because they can't make as much money as they could with another video.  Its BS and youtube needs to have a shit storm up their asses for this for damn sure!  What if every creator stopped creating and called youtube about this advising they will not post a video until youtube bans Logan?  I know that will never happen but what if it did?  Youtube would loose a lot more money then each creator, that's for damn sure!  All about money?  Lets take away that money and see how you act!
Buffy  love tyinus No, actually I have publicly posted a video of a dog in a gas station and approached some, on video, that brought a flying pet parrot in Walmart.  Both after Irma and i was in the middle of a week without power thus why I was there charging devices.  Everyone was doing that.  But he fakes a service dogs and then publicly videos that and puts it on the internet!  And no one, but us in the service dog community, says a damn word and, as you see here, everyone takes up for him though it is *FEDERALLY ILLEGAL!*   He breaks every freaking part of the ADA and every single State law (I know, I've read them all) on service dogs.  And if Kong was a service dog you wouldn't see him without him but you do.  He only faked it, as far as I know, for Kong to ride free in the airplane *BUT HE IS FUCKING RICH!*  Kong could fit in a carrier under his seat and he can afford the 50 bucks to do that.  And news flash, we need our dogs *24/7!*  Not just when we fly.
And, yes, if he stood over a service dog like he did that blue vested dog in the airport, with Kong there being aggressive, that could distract even the most well trained, fully trained service dog and if that dog alerts to seizures or really any medical issue (like fainting with POTS) that person can fall, hit their head, and die.  That wouldnt be murder but rather manslaughter but it would cause jailtime either way.  And he's been in jail so no first time offense for him.  It is that freaking serious!  We rely on these dogs to stay alive many times and so standing over a service dog like that with your super aggressive dog is that serious!
Service Dog In Training Chopper wtf your saying like he's murdering people and selling drugs? Like chill a lot of people do this shit oh but because logan paul puts it up you go on about him instead of everyone that does it
Ella ikr they're just as bad as him for supporting him or absolutely stupid kids who have no common sense
Aj Sarno 1. I don't live near him so I couldn't and if I could I would 
2. This is big 
Are you trying to say you've made a mistake like that because last I checked I'm human and wouldn't do anything near disgusting as this
He is pathetic and always been,,, plus he is an actor so that apology video is so fake and not sincere, youtube should take some action here
If he wanted to raise awareness he could have edited out the entire part of the body and talk about what was seen and how it effects us but decided to leave in. I have never liked his narcissistic ass and  def dislike him so much mofe
I liked him for 1 month. Bye
He posted a video saying Im sorry
Fuck you guys! Logan made a mistake its normal. Ive made lots of mistakes in my life.
Oh well.... I thought 2018 was going to be a great year
I didnt see the body
This dude and his brother are both straight trash they both dont deserve to live.
This is all getting so out of hand...I don't defend Logan's actions at all but I just scrolled through some of the comments here and yes, guys I agree that he was in the wrong to post that video or show so much. However I'm seeing so much name calling and words I won't date repeat, it's like the disrespect is on both sides. Hate on me if you want, but don't call someone stupid or anything else for that matter for saying what they believe. I'm sick of it, we're all sick of it. What Logan did was wrong I know. There's going to be people on both sides, that's how the world works. Please be more respectful guys, I hate scrolling through and seeing so much hate on others. I respect you if you disagree.
a que gringo tan pendejo
So who is better jake or logan paul over all.
IVE SEEN HOW YOUR CRUELNESS HURT ANOTHER PERSON NEWS PEOPLE SOOOOOO WHAT ITS LIFE
i saw the video but didnt watch it..
Him and his loser friends were laughing in the video.......
Logan deleted said sorry twice and is donating to the suicide foundation
JUNIOR back off
Random frog uh Money
In the end, apologizing doesn't get rid or erase what bad thing you did. It's the viewers/followers/subscribers that decide whether or not they want to forgive and/or forget this situation. In my case, I'll forget about it in a week or something but I will definitely not forgive. 
Just the way he acted in Japan as a whole was so rude. The Japanese men that were at the fish market even said "" which means don't get too cocky or don't get too carried away (with what you're doing/with your fame). 
What he did was wrong, not a mistake. He could have edited his video when he got back to his hotel or something, but decided not to. 
It's simple. Like I said before, what he did was wrong. It was against the law in Japan. (Search more about it if you don't believe me) 
That's all
Knoppy yep
So what?
I saw this on the news when I was watching the film theorist
La re cago el chabon. Ganaba biena guita y todo. Con qu necesidad hizo eso? Bue.. se le iran sponsors y asi aprendera supongo.
Good bye Logan. Youre getting banned. Youre a pig.
so you're going to try and make suicide lower but then laugh at it? oh yeah, makes soooo much sense 
Logan you suck so much. I hope your career ends
If they made fun of Logan I would smash there ball sack
PLZZZ DONT BAN HIM
*He's so full of shit*
Im still a Logan fan 
He can quit YouTube
SHUTUP NEWS DON'T BAN HIS CHANNEL
Logan Paul is still awesome btw I actually thought that his video was alright I kind of agree that it was intended to make a positive ripple
No Way
I cannot stand this dumbass narcissist. I don't know how anyone is surprised by this ahole.
Everyone who continue to still defend Logan, read this. You need to realize that there is absolutely no way to defend him. Not even by saying that humor is his way of coping. If he had any humanity he wouldn't have posted that video. What he should have done is sit down in front of the camera and explained what he saw, with ZERO photos or videos of the body, and gave a speech about suicide prevention or something like that. Uploading a video of a HUMAN BEINGS DEAD BODY is a terrible fucking thing. It is disrespectful to that person and to the millions of people that have lost their lives to suicide. If you continue to support and defend Logan Paul after this, gain some fucking common sense or get the hell off of YouTube, you are oblivious to how terrible of a person Logan is.
The video was age restricted and could only be watched if you were sign in with an email. What kid has an email?
If youre reading this, subscribe to my channel
What the fuck is all the uproar about?  Content or his behavior?  So he posted a video of someone who hung himself...ABC and the rest of you, get bent!  There's already a whole documentary on the internet with more graphic video on the many suicides committed each year in the Aokigahara forest of Japan .  People...go do some research before forming an opinion.  Does that make Logan Paul in idiot?  Not necessarily in that department...but he is another one of millions posting stupid commentary videos just for viewers' hits.
For everyong calling him a weeaboo this is the definition 
A weeaboo is someone who worships pretty much anything that is Japanese or related to Japanese culture. The implication is very negative and often is an accusation of wanting to 'be Japanese' (or whatever their warped perception and idealisation of Japaneseness may be). Often the image is that they pepper their language with little bits of Japanese that they've (often erroneously) picked up from anime.
My little sister watches him wtf well time to break her iPhone
Wow Logan Paul is is entering 2018 with drama ... I mean its sad that hes going down ... in 2k18
Could we forget about Logan Paul and let him drown into the Dead Retarded YouTubers and pay respects to the man who had taken his own life
How To Get VIEWS AND ATTENTION.
Go to a big city somewhere in the world.
Go to a suicide forest (restricted area)
Find a dead body hanging
Record him
Post on youtube
get millions of views
easy.
TMZ is so full of it, they pick
dose this mean he is daleting his changle plz say no i love him so much
Logan Paul 4 life
You need to f*cking stop with this bs, he said in the beginning of the video and towards the end that suicide is not the right answer to not do it. He was not "laughing" at the dead body that he found. He actions I admit we're a bit to much but how would you feel if you found a dead body or someone who committed suicude? His laugh wasn't suppose to be a hahahaha that's funny, it was a hysterical laugh that he didn't know what to do or how to cope with what he had found in the forest that unfortunate day. Everyone is blowing this out of proportion and it shouldn't be all over the news. He made a mistake and it's not like we haven't made mistake before. He apologized for his actions and he also took down the video. So everyone needs to stop trying to ruin his career. I'm still with you Logan Paul, I'm not going to give up on you, even if you do make some mistakes, it's ok, nobody's perfect. #Logang4Life
And he is 22 year old like he had too know what the hell he is doing
When I was 22 I was working 12 hours a day to get through college taking care of my dying dad and volunteering at the Salvation Army. Also when I was 16 I understood life. Yeah I mean. Hes a white rich boy itll be okay
Your name speaks volumes of the credibility  of your argument.
Ugly Ass not subbing
Claymore Kevin sub
Qui Van Nguyen u
SAM AND COLBY ALREADY WENT THERE!!! THEY ALSO FOUND A BODY BUT THEY ARENT STUPID SO THEY PUT THE CAMERA AWAY AND SORTED IT OUT WITH THE POLICE BEFORE UPLOADING. THEY DID THIS LAST YEAR! LAST YEAR, AND I NOT TALKING ABOUT DECEMBER LAST YEAR, IM TALKING ABOUT LIKE JUNE OR SO. THEY KNOW WHEN TO STOP VLOGGING. BUT LOGAN, LOGAN,HE JUST WANTS VIEWS. HE WANTS MONEY AND FAME AND IS THE WORST ROLEMODEL YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE. HES A SELF CENTERED JERK THAT DOES STUPID STUFF FOR MONEY. HE MADE THAT TWEET SO PEOPLE WOULD FORGIVE HIM AND THINK HES INNOCENT. HE WANTS ATTENTION AND YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE HIM IT 
GO AHEAD YOU STUPID LOGANG PEOPLE TALK SHIT IN THE  COMMENTS BUT IM RIGHT AND YOUR FIGHTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW IM RIGHT AND YOU THINK STARTING DRAMA IS COOL. BUT IT FUCKING ISNT. ITS ANOTHER PROBLEM THE WORLD HAS TO FACE. 
GREAT WAY TO START THE NEW YEAR LOGAN, GREAT WAY 
Never liked him never will like him
As he had once stated his goal is to make it as a mainstream actor... Even his apology is all a act..and the simple minded have no clue
sure he made a mistake, and thats forgivable. but what really ticks me off is how him and his buddies were laughing about it, and in his apology he has the nerve to claim he was trying to raise suicide awareness?!!?? the video wasn't activism, it was an attempt to get hits. PERIOD! 
 He showed his true colours, and got caught out,and now everyone can see him and his giggling friends for what they really are. Change the channel kids!
He really talk it too far really too far he sould have too know what was he is doing
All of you are dum Peale and logon was to trying to get viewers he was trying to raise awareness of suacide
so what everyone has a right to say. Stop attacking one guy for what he did he is a fucking human we all make fucking mistakes ur a fucking socialist you should know that by now. But of course socialists are naturaly filthy people
OMG DID YOU EVEN WATCHED HIS OTHER VIDEOS HE DISRESPECTED THE WHOLE JAPANESE CULTURE
umm...isnt that what i am trying to prove?
ProzSkilLz hey learn how to make a mistake we all do it no one's perfect
1:50 debonkle?
I low-key Got mad when she called subscribers *Followers*
A rant well made, but, first of all, he was in the wrong by posting the vlog but also he did something really good by posting it. That vlog showed the sad reality of the world and what severe depression might lead to. It gave a perspective on the world and there is no point in hiding it. Again it wasn`t the best idea to post that vlog due to his audience age group. but there wasn't any point in not posting it.
This is a growing up experience 
No matter how old u r it doesnt accumulate to how bad the situation was...
Subscribers not followers
Hahhahahahahai hope i made your dumb life better
Lol you just fed the beast. The f people didnt know who he was, they do now ha ha. Seen this coming.
He apologised that's all that matters
its 2018
I hope someone laughs at ur dumb hanging body when you die .!!
Did he just use logan paul for Clickbait?  Kinda looks like though... Pewdiepie post videos for his everyday living so does logan paul and every other youtubers.. so he was just doing his job.... which is vlogging and he saw a dead body and was shocked.... even i would do the same thing if i was in his place... its a moment of being and he do respect people and their lives and thats why he also left a positive message..... not like okay you can do suicide..... i know it is disrespectful   but you need to see it from a different angle too... any daily vloggers would do that not for views but for a message bro       and he is sorry for that..... but yeah logan got more famous for this things he did
@LoganPaul well Logan understands what he did wrong and he said he was sorry go watch his video. He just wants to impact the world many people saw this which is what he wanted so he could raise awareness for suicide. He even took the video down.
GROWING UP EXPERIENCE?!?! ABC THE FUCK??? they/he disrespected this man who made a sad decision to take his life in a country where part of their culture is heavy n big on respecting others, especially the dead
Mr. Man Guy definitely not defending this piece of shit
Italia Chable 22 is an adult, plus I know many people under 18 that in their right mind who wouldnt do this
Rosebud Studios hes 22, an adult, he should know better
Its a growing up experience for rich assholes like him.
maritza I dono if you are hating or defending him
Sucide is not a freakin thing to joke about. now i hope you start doing sucide after you get banned ur gonna be deppressed!!!
I made a video on the situation too if you guys want to check it out
well devil's advocate they call it the "Suicide Forest" i'm not sure what kind of people they expect going to a place with a name like that
Omfg he just made a mistake leave him alone asss holes
What a piece of shit and how shitty that you guys talk him up at the end of the video.
ABC you guys SUCK...even your quote of what he said in the intro was not correct at all. You guys spin shit so much to make people look bad for your guys ratings. FUCK ABC NEWS.
we all make stupid mistakes and this one is a whooper.....idk who knows how we would react coming upon this sort of thing, guys typically do stupider sh*t when in crisis. we live to do more stupid sh*t another day... life goes on
Sophie turner your a idiot number 1 number 2 well actually apology does work sometimes so shut up idiot. Number 3 he does experience what that guy went thro he is heart broken because of haters like you
omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I forgive him it's not his fault
new years:2017 rick Barwick makes the most funniest video I saw. new years: 2018 Logan Paul makes a video of he dead person new years:2019 war breaks out the USA and North Korea

Logan Paul made it to the news yea we made it
Logan paul bye
His only !!! FU you guys . Unsubscribe
IT WAS A MISTAKE GOODNESS
Stop talk about that it makes my cry
I like logans green hat tho
Stay out of it
It's their job? Reporters covering the news?
high5juan gamers oooh Maverick coming
high5juan gamers shut the fuck up
In a way, he's right, his actions were historic.
Has anyone advertised a dead body to manipulate mindless viewers? I think not. The action was regressive.
Smh blind idiots. He isn't fucking sorry
Dude he made a mistake he can fix it just stop dude!!!!!
Allegedly showed a dead body wtf?
People's dead body get shown on tv all the time, I'm not defending his actions, y'all need to give the boy a break. People do dumb things at time, we all do things we regret, mistakes are part of life! He's a vlogger that his lifestyle. And clearly at thr beginning of the video he stated the video isnt monetized. You guy's are blowing this whole thing out of proportion. At the end of the day, if the police would have found it, it still would have been on the news.
Allegedly
Who puts "We found a dead body in a Japanese Suicide Forest," if you're trying to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention?
First time I hear of him , I think YouTube needs Reset button , to filter the Junk and the trash ."the Subscribe" button is turning American into dump society
*someone*- why don't you like the Paul brothers???
*me*-shows them this video
FUCKERS
I dont get why YouTube support him, maybe YouTube is being blind through his actions
Oh yeah this is new              you only see things like these on tv shows and movies
Im crying!!!!!! God I hate this why why!!!!!! I hate my life with this Im crying so bad right now he said he was sorry I dont want to watch this anymore he is my role model why why why why
He should have just censored the body and it would have been fine
Wut bout BTS
Logan Paul is a fucking cunt.
Logan Paul needs to shove an stick of copper in his urethra.
Adpocalypse 3.0
#BanLoganPaul
Lavender Moon nope #dontbanloganpaul
Hey Logan go back to the forest and hang yourself. We can film it and laugh
i will never subscribe to his sorry ass channel
#UNSUBSCRIBELOGANG. He's disgusting trash.
Fuck you shut the fuck up and stop talking about it
Why logan this wouldn't have happened if u wouldn't have posted it
Hes on the news!!!!!!!! This is not good
"Apparent" "alleged" how much more evidence you need to say that's what he DID.
And that's why I hate him.
good it needs to follow his ass
If he doesnt loose all add monitization i will be suoprised
Oh who cares. Kids see worse things in life.
This video is shit sory for coursing but fuck it
logan and jake paul are stupid pieces of shit
Stop saying you wont forgive him, this is something you will forget about in two weeks.
chinge su madre logan paul y quien lo siga.
Logan paul what where you thinking
He did it on accident dont even think of dealing his channel
Logan paul was in my backyard please watch my video thankd
STOP NOW!
All u people r acting as if uve never done anything wrong those people who called him trash r trash themselves. At least he owned up to his mistakes. Havent u done anything that u so dearly regret how would u feel if people were calling u out on it??? Guys think before u say.  Also I am in no way trying to say that what Logan did was good because it was bad however we need to see that he wasnt trying to do it for views,money or fame he wanted to cause awareness. But he just didnt do it in the right way. Logan4life
xX_MLG_M3M3_M4ST3R_SWEG_Xx  I totally get ur point however people hve different ways of handling things. Logan just reacted in a way that would understandably distrust other people.
Of our we've all done something wrong, the difference is that his "mistake" is much worse. Also think about what you are typing before commenting. You're defending a person who laughed at and filmed a dead body
Guys change of topic! Logan paul is in my Backyard. Please watch my first vide
Okey he posted that video bc he cares about suicide not bc of the views, if he wants to get views he can act the way he is, and do stupid shit,?!
y'all have no prove
0:33 15 million *followers* on youtube
this is disgusting!! I cant believe he would do that. He is an adult! Im so disgusted by that.
"The smiling and laughing is not a portrait of how i feel of the circumstances" No, its for viewers on your channel, and is the reason you went to one of the most suicidal area's in the world and got it on camera...., because you know...., Suicide doesn't hit  home when its in another country. Anyone believes these lies about he's sorry, we as a society need to step up and take this crap off the entertainment agenda, (entertainment).
It's fucking the startt of 2018, and this now?
He needs mental help. What a sadistic fuck
Yeeeeaaaa the comments were right he is pure trash 
ItzDarkWing Gamer ohhh shit
ItzDarkWing Gamer parden me um, who's the one talking?
Killerfoxy Foxy SHEEP
ItzDarkWing Gamer na
yes he made a mistake...a mistake youtube should punish him for, immediately!!!...and the way they do it is by stopping the cash flow to his wallet.
Thanks to Lowlife Paul my 11 year old son has now seen a dead body for the first time! I have tried to protect my son from this type of stuff but it's all been undone by his vid. Logan knows his demographic! How can he do that knowing most of his viewers are kids?
Every child needs to know, it's the terrible truth of life.
You can't escape death.
Killerfoxy Foxy it should not be a parent's job to tell what their child what they can and can't see in a heavily secured platform. Logan should have not posted the video in the first place
AndrejQG HD is your fault cause you need to see what video he post to make sure he dont see it
Happy new year! What a way to start it off
George fuckin Stephanopoulos.
Logan Paul is a joke and seriously he is a fool and he needs to be taken down. It was a poor apology and really insencerce and it was click bait not funny... and the kids that have watched this and youtube is a joke for not taking it down and he needs to be removed and taking down a notch but the parents should not let there kids watch the trash on his videos, whats worse the hat he wears in the video and how he laughs, the click bait etc is all about the money.... suicide is not a joke and the poor family shame on you for not providing real commentary
#FUCKLOGANPAUL
Dear Paul Brothers, Please go back to Vine, It would be very much appreciated xD
LOGAN PAUL IS AMAZING!!!
Rydel Lynch why do you live him? Cuz he's hot? Because he isn't a good person. You have terrible choice in boys. 
He zoomed in on a dead guys face. That's horrible. Go watch the uncensored video and tell us you still love him.
Rydel Lynch what if logan film your dead body? Do you still call him "amazing" ? ugh wake up, you're supporting a disrespect human being!
Rydel Lynch You poor little kid I hope your time comes when you die slowly in pain.
Rydel Lynch logan paul is so immature and brainless. Yeah "aMaZiNg" for putting a dead person as his thumbnail for views and video it closer at that dead body and all he did was like "oMg iTs PuRpLe AnD bLuE!!" Sorry but he's just so stupid to upload but not cutting it. He's already old enough to THINK before posting it. He's an idiot period.
if you still love him then you're a moron i'm sorry but this incident made it very clear the guy just wants attention and he'll do anything to get it
SO MANY PEOPLE MADE VIDEOS LIKE THIS ABOUT THE FORST
I seen a abandoned nursing home video that had a carcass in it
Plz don't blame Logan he did not mean to laugh and make jokes plz don't blame him
he probably saw that and was like "this guy is gonna make me so much money"
Just sick
Holy shit he is so dead.
He's so sorry and feels so bad? Ok then, he will be paying for the funeral for the poor guy he exploited? Right?? To help his family correct??? or donate a huge chunk of that money to some sort of suicide prevention cause right!? Logan I couldn't stand you and now I know why...
@Hefty Tortilla don't bother, he's a logangster.
@ALANI UNDERWOOD we're you actually born stupid. You can stop defending him. And learn to spell.
Sadie Jones 
Logan Paul didn't kill the guy, did he?
LearnedAndVile i think he meant that in hindsight he shouldnt have but in the moment he didnt see anything wrong?  Im not defending him just trying to make sense of it
I love Logan Paul but this NO HUNNY NOO
Look at it this way in Japan if you stop somebody from committing suicide you can go to jail for interfering with their destiny.
Anyway a guy hanging from a tree  by his neck he asked "are you okay" laughs takes a selfie with the body
That's why they look at Americans like we DGAF because of situations like this 
STOP MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT A MISTAKE HE DID EVERYBODY DOSE MISTAKES IN LIFE BELIEVE IT OR NOT JUST STOP!
Oh no.
Ara Nicole oh no oh no oh no no no
Sarcasm detected.
Ara Nicole yo
*TURNS OUT THE DEAD BODY WAS FAKE, POLICE SAID IT WAS A STAGED SUICIDE, NOT REAL* Looks like after all this drama the suicide in Logans vlogs was *FAKE* . The police confirmed this a few days ago. I linked to their statements in a public youtube playlist for those that asked. honestly can't believe this
1000th LIKE
Reminds me of the stoner Sean Penn played spiccoli?
In case some of you wonder why people think Logan is a dumbass, well, there you go.
He's on the news
In the video he showed little kids running around by the forest, he said "what if a child saw that body" as if he was to care about the children, but Logan, you literally just showed millions a dead body. You disrespected that persons family and took the chance to little joke about suicide, not only that but you zoomed in on the body multiple times. I can't actually believe my little sister looks up to you.
LOGAN PAUL FINDS A DEAD BODY IN JAPAN, THERES A VIDEO ON MY CHANNEL!!!!!
Logan Paul can go fuck himself!!! AS WELL AS THEIR SUPPORTERS/SUBSCRIBERS
"He's only 22."
I'm pretty sure he is the age to know what's right and wrong, no?
That's the way he coped with the situation.
People cope with things differently.
Like how I laugh when I'm angry to calm myself.
Killerfoxy Foxy
Just because people have done worst doesn't make his actions any less terrible.
Greggory Lee ya hes not the only one you know a lot more worse stuff you know no okay
"apparent"? really?
this is exactly what he wanted to happen 
May that loser be Banned from YouTube
I'm glad this happened. Maybe these stupid insufferable cunts will go away now.
This was done for views you nasty pigs
Annoying fucking bastard. He keeps annoying the fuck out of Japanese citizens. No wonder Japan is a stranger to foreigners and tourists.
IT's the guys fault for committing suicide
He did a mistake
Im very disappointed in what Logan did. He made the biggest mistake he could've ever made.
what he did was horrible and disrespecting
Really logan? This aint what Mavericks do
He said sorry it was a mistake everyone makes them but to call him names that's wrong he was only trying to prevent that but  when u keep tweeting about it and talking about it that causes more negativity and beef and thats when diss  tracks start
"Oh no I stabbed someone but hey I said sorry please don't say horrible things about me because it can make me sad I mean I said sorry for stabbing them" so I can go hurt someone and just say sorry and it's all good right
Kelli Thomas he crossed the line when he made fun of dead people. That's not nice. Also yeah it is illegal to film dead people over there.
Are you kidding me? A mistake? I'm so sick of hearing that stupid excuse. How dense do you have to be to think that this was just your average mistake? He is a 22 year old ADULT who should know better. He isn't some 10 year old who has no concept of life. He broke the law and crossed so many lines. He did this to himself.
Kelli Thomas 1. Laughing, poking and prodding a body is not awareness. I believe he didn't even show the suicide hotline number. 
2. He broke a Japanese law. He should be in custody.
ABC u suck
OMG STFU
Two days into 2018 and this already happened..wow
This disgusts me.
"I didn't do it for views, I get views" 
Way to make the situation even more horrible...
before u start hating on him if u were he didnt know what was gona happen he cant read,the future and he is sorry everyone makes mistakes 
Logan Fans Coming Up And Shaken people that turned on him i guess me too :(
They should have also mentioned his retarded fans defending him and they should have read some of them xD
Free pass not a big deal he's white
He's not the first to find a dead body
He deleted it so stop coming at him
Who the hell is Logan Paul?
Welp Logan is gonna lose subs
Guy just ruined it all. What a fucking moron.
Logan is way better than you
His audience is tweens to kids not teens
Also it's a $300,000 dollar car
End of Logan 2016-2018 2th
Id rather watch the Angry Grandpa show
JUST HOW THE HELL DOES SOMEONE NOT EXPECT A DEAD PERSON INSIDE THE SUICIDE FOREST.
Sociopath! Point blank! This kid will end up killing someone or contributing to the death of someone before it's over!
It's called 15 million subscribers not 15 million followers
Maybe this was gods way of showing us that suicide is real and it is stupid
I never heard of the guy
Sounds to me #LoganPaul got what he always deserved 
is this even that bad
Now everyone has a video about it. Especially the youtubers with under 1mil subs 
Fuck Logan Paul
Well what a great start in 2018 folks
Oh my god he made a dumb mistake dont we all
hmm I didnt know laughing about a dead hanging body was considered causing awareness for depression and suicide. u h h h what an idiot
It was kinda a good idea cause it teaches you not to do that stuff
I think he did the right thing and I feel bad for him I'm sorry for him logang for live
At least he admitted that he did a mistake
He has said sorry
Fucking hate him
Allegedly I saw it I can tell you it happened I unfortunately watched it
The man saw the body . filmed it . laughed at it and uploaded it to youtube. The cunt should be kicked off the site
Is this the first meme if 2018
Yeah that's BS! As someone who suffers from Mayor Depressive Disorder that has attempted suicide, the video is disturbing and highly disrespectful. He flat out was holding is laughter during the video, the video was edited and uploaded with a title that screams "F YES! IM ABOUT TO GET THE MOST VIEWS IN HISTORY AND I DON'T GIBE A DAMN ABOUT THIS POOR SOUL HERE BECAUSE IMMA BE FAMOUS!" And his "apology" is BS he didn't even F$:!&$ Add links or phone numbers for Suicide Hotlines ans prevention. He is a disgrace and Honeslty Youtube should ban him.
The haters will be happy if he suicides
STFU Everyone Hes Said Sorry To many times Just To Have all This Hate On Him So Every Who is a Part Of The LOGANG Leave a Like And Go To His Channel And Subscribe And Hope He Gets Better F.R.O.G Forever Relying On God.... Me DrawPlayGames Signing Out Not Forever Just For Today...
I'm 20 and i'm more mature then this piece of poop
Every single re-upload I found on someones channel it said "this channel has been terminated" or "may contain graphic or gory images"
Dis going viral !
Stfu you guys are so fucking stupidly hypocritical. You guys disgust me. Logan did nothing wrong, and he coped with it the way he copes, I saw no fucking problem with it. But I for sure see a fucking problem with you. And making storys about it, leave it to Paul. You guys fucking suck
Abc Logan Paul is 22 not a teen get your facts straight before doing this
"I get veiws" that's a cocky ass statement
Wow. You known Logan Paul messed up if the NEWS talks about him.
Followers on YouTube
Logan paul was laughing when he saw the dead body
why is this news who cares? I
that definitely is a history on youtube because no one is dumb enought to do that
Wow, so he screwed up, and then hired some PR dude to write his text on twitter, and his script for the appology video. Idiot fucker
I really love Logan Paul and want TO defend him, but on something like this i cant defend him
He's a freakin grown man. So tired of people making excuses for this idiot. Him and his brother are going to kill this platform for all of us creators. Never seen someone so selfish and arrogant in my life - it baffles the heck out of me how 15 million people see him as likable.
"He's only 22" what about those guys in the military who are only 18 who are serving this country?!!! He is not a fucking kid!!
As someone who has had loved ones who died by their own hands, it's hard to deal with. To know their is people that will joke at others weak moments.
I watched a edited version of the video, and I see you and your friends joking and in a light and happy mood as you willingly go into a forest that is known for suicides. "People come here to commit suicide, about 100 a year" your words. 
You knew what you were doing, you edited your video, you uploaded the video, you were hoping for personal gain ... at someone else pain. Yes you stated you weren't going to monitise it, but, you were hoping for what you got in a way ... heavy traffic and notoriety. Let's be real. Well ... you got it. 
So you see a dead body and call the police. Thank you. Seriously, thank you, on behalf of that persons loved ones. 
Your intent was to do a video about ghosts. Great, but, again, you took time to film the body, edit the footage, and upload it to Youtube. At some point you think it would have dawned on you, I might not want to upload this one. Where is your empathy?
Yes you uploaded it with a warning and a message to those that are suffering to seek help. Again, thank you for that. However, you still were disrespectful. You even make light of the matter then apologize for it right away. Somethings not right there.
Guys I have said this one one of my first Vlogs, I've chosen to entertain you guys. So is this entertainment for you? This is the quality of entertainment you want to show your viewers? I feel sorry for you. You have it in your head to say sorry for cursing, but, not for filming a dead body? Come on, do you not understand? You coping with things with humor, is one thing, but, to cope and still put something up that is not respectful to others when dealing with death.
How would you feel if someone posted something for the world to see if someone you know and cared for died in any way? Is someones coping means of joking around respectful to you?
You'll survive and continue on Youtube I'm sure, because their is a very warped point of view for many of your generation. It's as if you have become numb to others when it comes to respecting them, and yourself. 
This is why I am sure there will be replies to this that will be childish, rude, and disrespectful. Thankfully their is hope of the future as all are not like this.
Honestly, would you have done a apology video if it wasn't a issue? Of course not because you do not see it as wrong. You do not see what you have done as disrespectful. You do not see others as human beings. It was all about "me". What can I get out of this. Will I be the first one to show this on Youtube?
To this I don't believe you are sorry, I don't believe you have really understood what level of disrespect you have brought upon others and yourself, and unfortunately you may not ever understand. 
I hope you never have to know what it's like to lose someone by their own hands. If you ever do, you'll understand.
Fuck this guy
Welp he just ended his YouTube career...
Mj DeGawd hopefully
Mj DeGawd unfortunately not his stupid fangirls are still there for him. his apology video has more likes than dislikes.
Killerfoxy Foxy you're probably like 10 or 8
Carlos Sanchez don't compare pew the god to a fucking disgrace guy named Logan Paul
No he didnt.. it is going to be worst than what happened to pewdiepie with the whole nazi and n word thing, he just wont get many deals with companies anymore, he will still have his YouTube account being able to upload anything he wants.
Today is my bday
Logan Paul is a Disgrace
Everyone on YouTube is getting views over this not just this blonde bimbo.
He didn't delete the video. YouTube removed it!
15 million FOLLOWERS
why would he up load this and put it on youtube, that was very wrong by doing that
I dont think youtube is going to ban his channel, why? Because youtube favours him, they actually reviewed the video and they still let it up and it was even on the trending page and every one saw it, its very disturbing and you clearly realize that youtube is very unfair.
This mistake has gone to far
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE RECORDED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE WHY THE HELL WOULD HE RECORD A HANGED UP DEAD PERSON WHOM HAVE COMMUTED SUICIDE. WHY THE HELL WOULD HE VLOG ABOUT IT LIKE FUCKING REALLY. I'M S FUCKING PISSED I WANT TO PUT MY FIST THROUGH A WALL.
@aaron paul @sophie turner u suck go be rude to some1 else ur jealius of logan cuz hes better then all of u
He's a total idiot, a bad example for people in any age.
How the fuck would this be a reality check for the knob? Hes probably swimming in all the publicity like the no nutted tadpole he is.
"alleged" it was 100% a dead body. He has hours of filming, editing, and uploading, to think about whether posting and disrespecting someones dead body was a good idea or not. This wasn't a mistake. It was thoughtout and organized.
Can you pls raise awareness that this guys fan base are mostly 12 years old or even younger, they are even defending him and kept saying its okay. Omg!
For those who are supporting Logan Paul in this; think about this. What if your family member (that I assume you have a good relationship with) decided to commit suicide at a Suicide Forest that is common for people to kill themselves in? You probably wouldn't want a vlogger and his friends hoarding around it, snickering and laughing. I found it pretty disrespectful that he seemed to be making a "joke" out of the corpse.
Do he realizes that his fans are the age of 4-13 yrs old and he gonna show them a man who took his own life. But why are u recording somebody death, and use his body as a thumbnail. U could spoke on it and did a new vlog for the day instead of clickbaiting a man body for 6 mil views. I really dislike Logan Paul.
I had a feeling that thumbnail was Logan Paul...
That's so f****** rude
For all the little b-tchy logangers here, let this be a reality check. Hes not a good person, do not worship or defend as if he is your one and only lord and savior. Its not like we want him to die but his actions do have consequences so calm down and stop being so cringey and annoying about it, you can just say, Hey if you dont like him dont watch him!, but thats a little hard to do when hes growing to being the biggest youtube community. Logan paul also needs to take this as a lesson, think before doing. I myself dont enjoy his content but as long is he is cool to us well be cool to him. And I want to say that all the over-the-top cussing psycho logang haters dont speak for me. But that doesnt mean we should have to show sympathy, he needs to learn. And we do realize hes human, but it wont kill him if he gets kicked from youtube. Its not ending his life, he can defend himself anyways so..  yeah
Logan is full of bullshit, he tried to save face by saying he was raising awareness for suicide lol yeah right
positive ripple the guy was laughing about it...
"apparent suicide victim" um whats apparent about it
0:32 his whole channel was a mistake
isn't ABC owned by Disney?
L O G A N G 
I like how during the vlog Logan says *"There are kids here! They might come across the body"* yet he his fanbase who left 600k likes mind you, (before the video was taken down) are probably under the age of 13/14, and *watched the video/liked it.*
All the Logan and Jake Paulers in the comments make me sick. Your God fucked up. Just accept it!!
Im sorry but why would u laugh that guy must have gone through something that made 
him kill himself
ITS DISGUSTING
He made a mistake mistakes happens even it the worse it happens we will forgive and forget soon he didnt realize the effects of it!
I have original video on my channel
You are advertising your shitty channel on a news video reporting a man filming a dead body for entertainment. Fuck you
I'm also pretty sure you liked your own comment
Logan Paul all day everyday
Subscribers*
Yes, Logan isn't allowed to make money off of a man's corpse. But ABC news sure is!
Logan Paul needs to be gone
There are way worse things that have been posted on YouTube, and it's acceptable because they are titled as "documentaries ", yet he shares this and it's "disgusting" or he's a "horrible person". Could he have been a bit more considerate about how the family of the victim wouldve felt if they seen this, or to show a bit more respec towards the man who passed? Or even how people would have received his video on such a controversial topic? Yes, he could have. But the point being is that he made the decision to share a real experience that he had to endure while trying to make an example out of the tragedy that it is and extending his hand to those who have or are currently struggling with any suicidal thoughts. I can see where you may think he was being inconsiderate towards the man who passed and his family, butnot everyone deals with those situations the same, and no one has even taken into consideration that he maybe have not even considered that it could be offensive, he could have only been thinking about how this was an opportunity to try and show those who want to commit suicide that it is real, and once you do it, there is no turning back, and that there is always someone who is there to help you and be there for you. And whats sad is that noone has probably even considered the fact that he, himself had just found a man that had killed himself, and what kinda things were going through his mind at the time. No one has even taken a moment to think how this may affect him in the long run. Noone has taken the time to think,well maybe Logan was shocked, and it didn't quite sink in just yet that there was such a serious situation happening in front of him when he was filming. Not everyone handles stessful or shocking situations the same, some laugh , some cry, some just shut down completly. How he handles that shock is noones place to judge.  Noone has even thiught about how he has to live with finding a dead man for the rest of his life and how traumatic it couldve been for him There have been many situations where there has been a triggering suicide because of discovering such a horrific incident, and Lord forbid that, that happen. It's a very sad and confusing situation to find another human being who has died, let alone one who has taken their own life. Instead of bashing him, and posting hate comments saying his career is over, and he's trash, and that he should die, why not try to express your dislike of the video in a kinder manner, and try to be a bit more compassionate. I understand that it made make you angry, but a leading even more hate towards someone is not going to solve anything, it is only going to make the situation even worse and more negative than it is. And by the media bringing attention to this even more than it should, it is only a horrible reminder to the victims family who I'm sure is having a hard enough time dealing with the passing of a loved one, let alone having to continuously hear about it over and over again on the news broadcasting and all over the internet. I understand that everyone has a right to express how they feel, and I completely agree that Logan paul could have edited the video different and in a bit more respectful way, but he made a mistake. And it can't ever be unseen by those who have viewed it, myself included,  but he has respectfully apologized and there is nothing he can ever do to take it back, all he can do is learn from his mistake And try to become a more compassionate and respectful person. And to those who don't accept his apology, ok, great, don't follow him on any social accounts and continue to dislike him, that is your business, but it isn't necessary to post such hateful and ignorant words that could potentially harm another person.
He should apologize to the family
Hes 22 years old he doesnt need anymore growing up hes grown enough to know whats right and wrong and what can be posted and not be posted he chose to put that mans body online and in his video for millions of children to see
Hes only 22.
This needs to be a growing up experience.
Im sorry, I thought that you learned not to film suicide victims BEFORE YOU BECAME A LEGAL ADULT! 
Im 17 and, not to brag, but I pretty much have that part figured out already! This is not a he didnt know better deal, because he _definitely_ shouldve known better, but this is a show of a personality trait that needs to be changed now before its too late!
He is influencing younger kids (ex.9 and 12) that filming everything is okay, and that nothing is off-limits, which is utterly wrong and irresponsible. There need to be major administrative action towards him after this.
why would he show the dead body, and he is going to raise awareness for suicide ? well, he is basically forced to make it by now because if he doesn't people are really going to hate him.
ALL THE HATE ABOUT JAKE WE DONT WANT THAT ON LOGANG JAKE WILL BE MAD AND SO WILL LOGAN HE HAS DONE ALOT OF GOOD THINGS AND LIKE JAKES SONG SAYS THAT AINT ON THE NEWS
Hes so fucked now lol
good thing andy
He was also being extremely rude to the Japanese public. He was screeching in the streets and being loud which is a big no no.
PLEASE READ THIS: 
you have to understand he knows he made a mistake, if he was a bitch who only cared about his money and views he wouldnt have deleted the video or took the time to make an apology video. We all can agree he should have put the camera down for that moment, but at least he did the right thing and apologized. He even explained in his video that suicide is not a joke and that there are people that care about you. Also in the apology video you can see in his eyes he is truly sorry, because they are watering. I bet you if that where Jake Paul in that situation the only thing running through his mind would be how many views he would get. Logan probably is feeling really terrible even without the millions of people telling how much of ass hole he was. I bet you (the person reading this) have made a mistake that you are not proud of, imagine if millions of people knew about that mistake and made videos like this one about how much of a ass hole you are. That wouldnt feel that great. Thank you for reading this. Please do not keep on hating on Logan, although he did make a huge mistake, imagine if that mistake you made was being rubbed in your face every day. Again thank you for reading this!
Random frog he explains that he didnt know how to react about the dead body, I mean if I am scared or worried I try to laugh to make me feel better, is there something wrong with that? Do you practice every day about what to do when/if you come across a dead body in a place where they dont speak English? I am not trying to hate on your beliefs but lets not hate on Logan ok? I just believe if someone makes a very bad mistake people shouldnt go around saying shit that makes him feel even worse than he probably is feeling, again you of course do not have to listen to me, but just image your self in his shoes. Would you want millions of people to point out your mistake to make you feel worse? Again you dont have to listen to me, sorry if you find any of this rude not trying to hurt your feelings.
Kaija Young to say logan paul is an asshole would be like calling Hitler a school yard bully. Logan paul is a manipulative, greedy, evil sack of shit who *laughs at suicide victims in front of their corpses and has the gall to upload the video to youtube*
His title and thumbnail for that video was both mocking and offensive on so many levels.
Mina The Raichu You can tell that he knew he made a mistake, he wouldnt have deleted a video that could get millions of views if he wasnt feeling bad. In his history he has also broken laws; a dwarf in a suit case, riding on top of cars, burning a mattress, etc. he has not gotten rarely any hate on doing  that, so I am simply asking for those who are commenting on his video that he is a bitch to stop  The officials will be able to determine if he should go to quart or something. In the mean time lets not make him feel worse than he is feeling now, k?
sorry, but youre also "accusing" or trying to tell people that logan is actually sorry when you don't 100% know that. the only person that knows is logan himself. you're being super hypocritical right now...
Kaija Young Recording a dead body without consent is illegal in Japan. He literally broke a law.
Forget all you hateters 
He didn't mean to 
LOGAN IS A GOOD KID BITCH U SHOULD NOT DO THIS HE IS NOT BAD HE JUST ONLY WANTED TO PAY RESPECT
*_"I didn't do it for views."_* 
Really now? Well, if he *didn't do it for views* - as he likes to say - why would he ever go over to a *suicide forest* and *film himself whilst doing so?* I don't know about any of you; but I don't know *anyone* who has casually just filmed a *dead body at suicide forest;* claiming "it wasn't for views." Even if this was *supposed to be* a _"suicide awareness message,"_ I'm pretty sure it was conduced *very poorly.*
Greggory Lee *conducted
Logan Paul is a stupid ediot u need to respect people that are dead and you showed a dead guys body it's a good thing that you didn't show his head
I see his fans and followers are out to make excuses for him almost everybody knows about this place and what its used for anyone with a brain wouldn't of filmed the dead guy they would of called emergency services, but no he wanted views so his little speech doesn't wash he's mid 20s and acts 12 says a lot and he deserves all the bashing he gets .
He is just sorry cuz  he is losing sponsors, followers and money
Well now here's proof of how much of a jackass he really is. Sponsor go bye bye. Raise awareness my ass. He did it for the views and $$$$$.
Jake is my favorite again fucking logan trixs are for kids
Hating on Logan Paul doesnt make you little boys and girls any better. You guys cant be hypocrites. Two wrongs dont make a right. Yes, Logan did a huge fucking bad thing but hating on him? Seriously? Grow the fuck up. People like you who bully and hate DRIVE people to suicide. Think about that. Now all you little kids should get the hell off YouTube and stay off YouTube until you stop being little shits. Im not taking his side. Im just stating the facts here. Hating on somebody who made a huge mistake is not okay. I swear, if any of you 12 year olds comment and say that Im wrong. So help me. So fucking help me. You little kids will never hear the end of me.
Fuck these youtubers. Talentless queers
It's like a Black Mirror episode when GMA goons are gawking at him at the end.
Oh crap it's Logan paul
Dont judge until u watch
I feel like people who watched Logan vlog about the dead body made them kind of want to go to the suicide forest and just commit suicide there :/
Media coverage of all types will only leave the man with even more subscribers. That's the world we live in.
I feel what he did was stupid yes but I feel like it raised awareness for suicide for young children and suicidal people who watch him
What a fukin idiot
Ok so if the title says found a dead body in the Japanese forest and you are hating on him and the video then why did you watch the video.Like if your so affended then why did you watch it. STOP HATING WHY DID YOU WATCH THE VIDEO IF YOU ARE AFENDED WITH SUISIDE
2018 is sure off with a great start...
Good 
Logan might be going to jail
I dont like him or his brother
DAMN now abc news......this will follow Logan forever 
Megan H oops, wrong person. Deleted
Megan H *Good*
Good.
it better
Megan H damn you fine
I still have love for Logan
1:49 you wanted to make people aware of suicide by laughing and joking about it?
I hate how this doesnt make him look that bad
he is awesome
I thought his Danielle bregoli video was the worst but he topped it
There are also other channels on YouTube that show how people are getting killed Logan basically blured the body
Allegedly showing the body 
Dude, there are multiple forms of video evidence. How is it still alleged?
lmao he's not a kids anymore.he's 22.he already know what he's doing. so people defend it was just a mistake? lol
No one is mentioning the fact they were all laughing and a dude literally said "lets take the camera closer". Its way outta line. There was no empathy. They were all cutting up and laughing. He didn't do it to spread awareness. He did it for views. If I was filming and saw a dead body it'd cut the footage and make a video talking about why I stopped it. It'd be emotional! Its horrible when someone is so down to the point they wanna die. I wouldn't be smiling and laughing and zooming closer. I deff wouldn't make it a thumbnail. SMH. Real life jobs u get fired if you do something real bad. This is REAL BAD.
Raise suicide awareness???!!? He laughed and smiled about the body!!!
Squeaky Clean Cliff  i hate that fucking bitch cause i had a timeline where i didnt feel good end then he fucking laughing at a deadperson WHO didnt feel good he is such a fool
@R1OT LittleStew learn to spell, bitch. And stop defending Logan Paul. Because all he cares about is views. And don't bother using anime to describe someone attacking your "God" with reason, because everyone else knows your a fanboy who acts tough but fails miserably.
@Yadiel no, YOUR the stupid fuck. You're actually defending a guy who just posted a corpse and laughed. People like you deserve to get blacklisted.
@Wasalasilas Bums how about you stop defending that piece of shit? He's not your good or Lord and savior.
Oh look someone's killed themselves hahaha
I am just a 10 year old girl that love and adore Logan Paul. I am just asking if you guys can please stop picking on Logan because he did not mean to cause any harm. Just because I love him ( can you guys please stop talking about him ) he said sorry a lot in his resent video (A LOT).So I am going to ask again nicely  can you please stop. I have never seen Logan cry or "his eyes watering" and when i seen him crying i started crying to. And I am sure that some of the Logangsters will say the same.
                          Thank you
Joseph Stalin or smiling
Joseph Stalin he was not laughing
Tiara Wilson he was smiling and talking about depression  while there was a dead person beside him
Joseph Stalin he did not laugh he was shock. If you was in the Logang  you would truly know how I fill
Tiara Wilson saying sorry aint ok when you laugh at someone who killed themselves
I bet Logan just made this video to get attention and more veiws
I knew this would go on tye news
Most people let Logan sound like a bad person give it up people
I mean Logan did the wrong thing and he made a couple of mistakes. But imagine how he feels after all of these people hating on him. I was angry on him too, but cmon we have to forgive him
I have watched it and you are painfully gullible if you think he was sincere in apologizing whatsoever.  His apologizing and concern were veiled as thinly as they could possibly be.  His face is that of someone pretending to feel emotions almost the entire time.  Do you think any person that actually cared would upload the video without even editing out the dead body?  REALLY?  I'm sure he's so deeply sorry to the family that their relative was exploited for views.
Michigan Football Go Blue! You do realize that kids wouldnt have found the body right? The forest has paths designed to keep people from seeing this, which also means that he went into the restricted area in order to see a dead body. If he really had respect for the family, he wouldnt have posted the video in the first place. If you were the family of this person, I dont think you would want to see their body in a thumbnail used to get views, then in that video seeing people laugh and make jokes.
jazzyhands You guys only looks at the bad dont you I mean he blurred the face said sorry to the family if they were watching said sorry to him if he wanted to disrespect it truly he wouldnt have done anything he would have just seens it and walked away and not call anyone or anything hes lucky he found the bodie before the kids did truly if you guys think he fucked up for good then so be it most people couldnt give two fucks about your opinion tbh. (Im just tired of seeing  people type away only from what they have heard.) if you go and watch the video (if you havnt already) you will see that he truly tried to respect the victim i want to see you make the right choices 24/7 and I want to see you in his position asking for forgiveness from people telling them that you truly made a mistake and how stupid and ashamed of yourself you are.
Sahl A no we don't Logan is a monster because of what he did
Sahl A 
A mistake is not filming a dead body and not editing it out
A mistake is not laughing at the dead body and not editing it out
A mistake is not making fun of a suicide victim and covering it up with this is for suicide awareness
He didnt make a mistake; this video shouldnt have been posted in the first place and the fact that you say he made a mistake is disgusting
"I didn't do it for views. I get views" how self obsessed is this guy
damn everyone is talking about this
HE MADE A MISTAKE
Raising awareness for your younger audience? I think your display of raising awareness is inappropriate and too quite an explicit subject for your younger audiences to fathomize. You are clearly an idiot.
The spirit of that dead body is finna throw some hands
Am I the only one who forgives Logan.
Thats is it iam going to Jake Paul I cant stand monsters and someone with such GREED... I would rather go to someone whos just an idiot then an monster!
Isn't it obvious that he would find a dead body
You should ask him permission not just make shit about him so stop theivs
ok what heck is wrong he just made a dumb mistake so what the  heck is the problom
But still screw you abc news go make news everyone will enjoy we kids want to watch what we watch ok so please just stop encouraging to parents to do shit about us kids and ruining our entertainment
Im just gonna say one thing at least he didnt show the face and identity. THINK ABOUT THAT. That wouldve been way more disrespectful. And some ppl laugh when they cant cry and theyre shocked. They have nothing to say and dont know what they do so they laugh. It doesnt mean its funny. And at the end of the vlog he posted suicide hotline numbers, he didnt want to be disrespectful, and he obvi doesnt need the views, hes already got so many.
Vitaly > Logan Paul
Shit on top of shit man xD
GetBiggTV @
Both suck ass.  Watch LIMITLESS EXP or FIVEGUYSTV
GetBiggTV    Vitaly is WAY worse
Logan you are right, that very video is your biggest mistake. 
You might even more famous afterwards but with more people to dislike you.
Games of Thrones is much worse than a plain old dead body, lol the irony is waytoo heavy! Who watches Game of Thrones?He did not show the body in the video for crying out loud
Wow .. what a way to start off 2018
Fucking looser i had a friend who killed himself and he laughs about it...... Burn in hell 4 ever Trash... all of his followers are blind. Right now i want to kill myself.... reason youtube do not care 4 people. He needs money.... and media are supporting him... sad. So i guess my friend died 4 nothing and Logan sits and have a fun day...  fucking american psychopath....
Everyone leave Logan alone he made a mistake  damn ya act like ya never made a damn mistake in your life like tf
Hey maybe this is a GOOD way to start 2018!
One of the Paul brothers is about to fall!
Its not apparent this actually happened
Not right logan paul NOT RIGHT!
The fact the news is posting this. Damn this isn't good for him.
Logang for life
Talk about the real things that are relevant, not youtubers. They obviously did this for views.
why would he do that like why he so dumb
Fuck yall i hate yall stupid ass
Goodbye Logan you disgusting prick this shit hopefully just ended your career
Ok stop it was gust a accsident logang for life
Not paul it is logan paul
If you really want to see the real dead body, its in this video https://youtu.be/IGkAslXVX3Q
HE MADE A MISTAKE LET HIM LIVE
Logan Paul is 23 ya ABC idiots
Can't believe how offended people get, he's a young kid having fun now people find something to burn this man because of a comment the kid made. PATHETIC
This Guy his name is Logan Paul
I dont even know how any of them could smile and stand next to such a terrible scene. Id be in shock.
Every celebrity is coming for him  his channel needs to get deleted
Btw its not followers its subscribers
I hate whoever supports Logan, anyone who supports him is either retarded or a dumb child
Lol 15 million followers on youtube
To logen
Ther so mean
Btwwwwww logen u thought rowng
Its just wrong
Shut your DUMN as up
after reading tons of comments I start to think that I'm the only person who doesn't care about what he did and I'll still continue to watch his vids, because I like them. So, a lot of people said that Logan is disgusting, because he started laughing and made jokes, PEOPLE, he said it himself, this is his way to cope with things, there are a lot of people who are the same, I know I'm the same, okay. Also, "kids watch his video, he traumatized a lot of people". Those "traumatized" people, it is their fault, they're traumatized. It was on the thumbnail (the body) they knew from the beginning they'll see it, also at the beginning of the video there was a massage, I don't remember it, but It was enough for a sensitive person to understand that he/she should not watch this video, so those "traumatized" it is just their fault for being like this!!! and he is a YouTube star, his vlogs are around 10 minutes, this is the normal daily content for it, he couldn't just put 5 min and then say "we found a dead guy" and I'm pretty sure he couldn't continue the vid, because it takes quite a lot of time to get to Aokigahara. He deleted the video, he apologized, just accept that and forget it. I really do feel like the only person who's not making a huge deal about it. also, just think for a second what Logan is going through.He saw it in real, the viewers saw it in a video, there's a HUGE difference. Yes, he did something disrespectful, but after all the fault is mainly in the viewers not in him
GO ON! ATTACK ME!!!
This is NOT a "growing up experience", it should be a "banning experience".  His sponsors are doing themselves damage by associating with this moron.
As one of the millions of people that saw the video before he took it down. I can say that he was disrespectful the whole time. Yes people have different ways with copping with things like that, but showing the body and laughing and stuff is straight up disgusting. I was angry and in tears because of his actions. I have had 2 important people in my life take their lives and I would not want their bodies exposed to the internet. Logan disrespected the victim, the victims family, and pretty much the whole of Japan with that video. He clearly just wanted the views and didn't actually care about the victim. He should have turned the camera off and not have even approached the body. Towards the end of the video a worker told him that they weren't allowed in that part of the forest and Logan laughed and smiled then told the worker that it was to late. He says that suicide is never the answer, and he is right and I can give him that, but, he still shouldn't have shown what he did. He deserves all the hate he is getting and should not be allowed back on YouTube. "Leave a like of you're sad," is f*cked up Logan. Fix yourself.
Wowwwwwww I karrrrrrrr so much"""""""
most of these youtubers are in it for the money and fame nothing new
What do you expect it's a Fucking Sucide Forest.
This bitch thinks that we're gonna buy his 'apology'
i mean considering that recording in aokigahara is possibly illegal, couldn't the japanese government ban logan paul from ever traveling to japan again?
edit: forgot to add that the japanese are probably shaming and have negative thoughts about americans now. wonder what logan paul fans have to say
On 0:36 even the news reporter don't know about youtube subscriber
Logan Paul did bad things doesnt mean he is a bad guy. HE IS TRYING TO PREVENT IT. He apologized what else do u want him to do. 
Nooooooo oneeeeee gives a flying fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Ladies and gentlemen may I present to you the Paul brothers!!!
Nobody cares fake news
AT LEAST I WATCH HIM EVERY SECOND HE LOST SO I GOT TO WATCH THE SUCIDE VIDEO SO I'M KINDA LUCKEY IDK BUT DON'T SUCIDE YOURSELF PLEASE GET HELP
The braindead 5 year old Logangers defending him in the comments make me never want to have children
"15 million followers on YouTube"
It's subscribers just letting you know.
Link to full Logan Paul Vlog Suicide Forest Vlog https://youtu.be/g4Wj3SIUhWk
fool people he didnt mean to do it.
Shut the fuck up
0:22 top entertainment influencers in the world? That shit made me cringe so hard .....
It's crazy how they were all laughing after discovering a dead body. I would of been crying and terrified for my life. However they don't care because they know how much views this video  will get and the big amount of money they would receive.
his main bad deed was uploading this i laugh at situations that are awkward like this too the guy is human cut him a little slack. he learnt his lesson with uploading it and lets leave it there
laughing at a scary awkward situation is very human, he isnt laughing from entertainment or joy its because hes scared and or a little bit traumatized
Princess Amal He was probs fucking terrified and ppl have diffrent ways of coping when seeing something bad like when i got told that my grandmother died i laughed for hours but did you really think i was happy no
Crayon laughing is fine. I know someone that copes by laughing. Whats bad was that he chose to edit and upload this.
Ashley Settle i aint a logan paul fan, but its what happens in fucked up and unbelievable situations. Ive been through bad shit and its a strange feeling your brain goes through, relax
DUDE WTF HE SHOULDNT BE ON THE NEWSSSSSSSSSSSSS
First thirteen reasons, now this. I never thought I'd ever do the mainstream media encouraging/normalizing suicide. What a world we live in.
This is just bringing more attention to the situation
NEVER APOLOGIZE
He legit hasnt lost more than ten k subs bu this isnt right he shouldnt have posted this
Stop giving this guy more attention
Human being had lost his life and this f*cking idiot& his friends were all smiling, cracking joke looking at the dead body. He did these pathetic things to get viewers & monetized revenue at any cost no matter whom it hurts. YouTube SHOULD close his account immediately.
#thisisnotthepaulsplatform
But Logan was wrong Brendan told him to put down the camera and leave but he didn't
I didn't realize how bad this was
need to shut up because he didn't know that some person just killed himself so shut up
Homie just said "15 Million followers on for YouTube" 
I feel bad for Logan 
These celebs are just haters! Logan doesnt need to be pointed out like this! It was a mistake, OKAY!! Why wont these celebs understand that he is very very sorry and that he actually hopes that no one experienced this, and in that vid, he specifically said that HE DOESNT WANT ANYONE TO COMMIT SUICIDE!! HE WANTS ANYONE TO KNOW THAT HE IS THERE FOR YOU!! WHY WONT YOU PEEPS UNDERSTAND THAT
No wonder Ive never been and never will be a maverick
Logan should suicide . Apologize for what, what he did was stupid
These Logan brothers are dangerous to our children , the stuff they put out they for kids to see , just shit , killing the minds of our children ,the next generation to rule over the world , there's got to be a stop to these evil men , , making millions to poison the minds of our children !
I'm almost crying I am one of the biggest logangsters ever I forgive him for what he did stop hating on him he did a mistake
Wtf was this ending. Are you telling news or sucking up to Logan....confused.
No-one on YouTube likes Viners anyway
Logan Paul is now the new Jake when I found this I was like wow 2017 best year of your life and you start off like this on 2018 this is probably gonna be the worst year of his life
Mark Whalon wtf did he do to you?
AnimalMaster55 AnimalPro lol
They're both bad
AnimalMaster55 AnimalPro NOOOOOOOOOOO....probably true hate you Jake
I love Logan Paul so much and i dont want Logan paul to quit Youtube  #SaveLoganPaul
"15 million "followers"
Just take his channel down already YouTube
Did she said 15 million follower on YouTube
What does matter <-<
How bout that tfil youtuber they didnt get in trouble
Let this be a lesson to us
Dont let fame get into your head
Fuck you I like logon
I'm not going to defend him at any degree. However  he said laughing is a coping mechanism. Now should he had posted that no not at all. There was many different ways to handle that and that was not it. Logan doesn't seem like a bad guy. I mean i've never saw any of his videos before but even I can understand that even though he made this mistake it shouldn't define who he is or how his job functions. He apologized and took the video down... at this point the blame falls to YouTube, the people who wanna see this, and the people who post it again. whats truly disrespectful is rehashing it. People like this can destroy Logan's life. Not letting him forget is like constantly reminding him of what he went through. You don't know how he feels about what he saw. He knows it's not a joke. My point being why try to destroy him and put him down when he is clearly upset by this. We shouldn't let one mistake define him! Again not defending him just stating facts people seem to be conveniently leaving out
I seen his video and its so messed up thats why I dont support him and he was laughing a few mins after the incident happened like think about what happens then speak dont think then speak.
You saw it
it was taken down but many people are reuploading it. But they don't show the body because its against youtube rules
i watched it too. i'm scarred for life
XxXvegywolfyXxX LEGEND where can I watch it
Goddamn the Pauls are absolutely disgusting
This guy is trash, what a dick. How many apologies can this guy give before people actually stop watching and see he is just a crappy human?
Just leave him alone he apologize Of what he did
Jimmy savile junior.
I thought Jake Paul would be on the news not Logan Paul
I hope that I can get as many views and subscribers as he does one day!
this bastard deserve to die.fucking logan..
Did it feel good tho
2017 sucked YouTube wise,  the rise of retards,  don't infect 2018 please,  its not like its gettingbetter
I was honestly expecting this type of bullshit from Jake Paul, not Logan Paul. Never thought I would think Jake Paul is a little more better than Logan Paul.
The worst is he's a f****n' winner anyway, cause it doesn't matter what they say, it matters they say.
This is only the start of 2018 we have been warned.
@Nothing is better than harry styles ye just gotta hope 2019 is not at the very least worse
Oh 2018 been a bad year
*THE DEAD BODY LOGAN FILMED WAS FAKE* Police confirmed he staged the suicide, This is the latest news, i put the evidence into a youtube playlist for those that want the truth
Ashley Cooper pewdiepie said the n word and he got hated even through it was one mistake
"Allegedly found a body"
HE DID FIND A BODY AND SHOWED CHILDREN, AS WELL AS LAUGHING
Logan paul is the best ever how dare you
Guys heres the full explanation 
https://youtu.be/oG4npqhT7B8
Holy shit he was on the news
Also Aaron, you should be ashamed of yourself piece of shit.
Jeez this guy over here donesn't deserve to appear on the news like it's not okay
And ABC has only 3m subscribers... 
How is this on the news...
This is the American way smh!
I really don't care, I wanna see the dead body though
Parents you guys don't deserve to let you kids watch him any more it was a mistake he made I bet you all made mistakes you or some of you guys filmed something you you're not supposed to but that was a mistake I'm saying this from my hart he stayed sorry that's the only thing you should know and I'm just a kid and I'm giving you advice and that's the only thing I made mistakes ok now take it from me.
Jason vlogs ya he accidentally filmed a dead body, then accidentally uploaded it to YouTube. Total accident.
"Oh i mocked your deceased family member for views but i said sorry so its cool"
Jason vlogs 1. I recommend proofreading your comments beforehand.
2. I'm pretty sure your parents would smack you upside the head with a chancla if they ever caught you making fun of the deceased. You are only a child. You do not have the experience or wisdom to give anyone advice. Much less a parent. Laughing at someone who took their own life to get away from suffering and being made fun of (presumably) is like adding insult to injury. There was no humanity in his actions. Not to mention what he did is illegal in japanese law. If sorry was enough, jails wouldn't be invented.
He made a mistake, we all make them. He even said he was sorry and he took it down. He never ment this all to happen. Everyone is now going off on him and it was an Honest mistake
Dirt bag .
That's it, 2018 is cancelled because SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE
Am I the only one who doesnt care? Like get a life people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMABRqh8t8k
my reaction to his video
He did do it for views. Anyone who believes his statement is fucking stupid. With the click bait and the obnoxious behaviour there were no sensible intentions for that video
Seriously. You're just giving him the attention he wants.
This is stupid just for one stupid video and bla bla bla
OMFG THE NEWS
I...Dont forgive him...But Ill keep on watching his vids cuz I know he wont do that ever again.And SHUT UP U HATERS.DONT JUdGE ME JUDGE YOURSELFS
Shame on Logan and his friends as well. Throughout the recording, editing, and publishing period, not one of them saw the wrong in there actions and allowed it to be posted on YouTube.
Is it fucked up i wanna see the body?
And this is why I just love Aaron Paul! 1:30
Is Aaron paul distant Relative of the Paul Brothers?
Kalena Velasquez He is known for his roles Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad aswell as the voice of the character Todd Chavez in the animated show Bojack Horseman. His most known catchphrases on the shows are Hooray and BITCH If you havent seen either shows, I recommend giving them a watch, hes subjectively funny, comedic, and an overall stupendous actor.
Luddington    Who the fuck is that
Is Aaron paul a distant Releative of the Paul Brothers
Shut up
The news should mind their own business like damn they be stalking people
Also happy new year behinds
MY CLASS MATES WATCH LOGAN PAUL
@kavos needs to hear about this
I want the truth about the world hidden from me.  I need a "safe space" and a pair of rose colored glasses.
It only one little mistake why people hating it was his first time experiencing a deadbody people might see one in their life
"spread awareness for suicide"
You mean that 2 sec note at the start of the video?
Hey it was real even tho he is always joking he was as surprised as everyone so what if he kept recording even one deals with sadness in different ways he didnt do it for money
fuck them
Awe these dummies over there at abc he gets more views than they do Lmao
HE SAID SORRY
BRO Disney hired this guy one time
Idiot.....
I love Logan jake is so much fuckin worse
Omg who in the hell cares omg a dead person over 100k people die a day who cares if someone post it on the internet
Why you hating
Leave Logan the FUCK ALONNNNEEEEEE!!!!!!!! I WISH I COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SHIT.
He makes me wanna kill myself in that woods
well logan is stupid and young and we all make mistakes I mean not as big as this but u need to forgive people sometimes I personally don't hate logan paul or love logan paul he's a human too and we all make mistakes
Logan does not have 15 mil
Anyone know where I can see this vid
no Logan please dont leave
Hey. Guess who's on the news now 
Holy shit he's on here now , he done fucked himself up
I saw the video, it was disturbing
If you think Logan Paul was trying to raise awareness about suicide prevention, try to find Logan Paul EVER talking about suicide prevention.
a positive ripple? yeah so that's why u joked about the body and laughed at it?yeah helps prevent suicide idiot
Boo he's my favorite YouTuber
He deserves to get removed for violating youtubes rules.
He didn't YouTube deemed the video safe but they put a age restriction on lmao YouTube is a fucking joke! People talk about real life things, get demonitized get censored, and your subs being unsubscribed from you constantly having to fight YouTube cause they wanna give you a strike for doing nothing wrong and trying to not have your account erased. But this guy still has his 15 million subs and probably getting paid.
WatarouDesiderus I don't want to start a fight but he did not no he was going to run into a dead body he probably didn't no what to do
Endless Ellie Sweetie, poking a body is not respectful. Did you poke your dead grandparent's body? I imagine not.
WatarouDesiderus for making a mistake? One mistake
WatarouDesiderus then why didn't YouTube delete
Its a suicide forest WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND
This is all over the Internet omg I saw the video before it got deleted
This really sucks for YouTube though things are really about to get bad for the YouTube Community
He doesn't deserve to be on the news but it's still funny
That dumb ass who the fuck shows a person who killed themselves because they had a hard life .Fuck u logan
logang
Hey, he appolligied so GIVE HIM A CHANCE LOGANGSTERS please give him a second chance. plz. Hey plz ITS OKAY. I GIVIN HIM A CHANCE. HE APPLLIGIEZED SO.. STOP ALL THE HATRED HE JUST WANTED TO HELP. I get what ur says no but YOUTUBE I BEG U DINT DELETE HIS POOR..POOR.. AMAZING CHANNEL! (Than made no sence) ANYWAYS PLEEEAAASSSEE
[EDIT] I know I made some typoos
He was probaly in shock of what he saw! ,made bad call thinking he could make a more powerful statement... his music is a lot more on positive side than others that encourage our kids to kill others or do drugs and they become the most highest paid without apology? He makes 1 mistake he trash? Whatever!
people act like he is the only one showing a dead body
Isn't the world a funny little place. A world in which the American Govt can just walk into a sovereign state and bomb the living crap out of it, killing millions and video footage of dead bodies to prove it. However when some guy finds a single body in a forest in which Logan played no part in the death... OMG social media and MSN go crazy. Is this because the US are the good guys so there's no prob's there ??  My message to all those people who gave Logan a hard time, grow up and look at the hypocrisy or what their saying . Your not targeting the real assholes, just a rant on how your Sooooo moralistic and how Logan was Sooooo insensitive. I didn't even know who Logan was until today and I don't even find him that funny, but he doesn't deserve this crap. And yes I've seen the full forest video.
Logan is a fucking cocky cunt
u are too
Are you fuckin kidding me?!
People have to ruin everything lmfaooo
I watched the vid before it was removed
Even though i am not a fan i see nothing wrong with what he posted.
Ok guys, dont hate but Logan made a mistake. A huge huge one in fact, even if he only said sorry because someone told him, he did. People make mistakes and he is going to learn from this. But Im not necessarily not made at him, but people uploading his video, after its been taken down. Those people are ALSO disrespectful because now youre putting it up back on the internet for people to see for views. Thanks for reading and PLEASE dont hate
"I didnt do it for views. I get views" fucked himself over even more with that.
Logaan did make a major mistake.Yes, everyone makes msitakes. This was immature though, and disrespectful to the family and people out there who are coming through deppresion. So, I love him but I will admit that was a mistake.
abc let logan be
Jordan Thakar    word
Erma Maxwell true I feel the same except I am a fan
Ok, what Logan did was dumb and fucked. And I'm not a fan of his, I've watched like 1 or 2 videos. But he has apologized twice, and people won't forgive him, and call him insincere? Yet after Pewdiepie used the 'n word' on two occasions, an apology cleared him of it. And worse, Pewdiepie thinks it's fine to hate on him as well. Like, he was in a pretty similar situation, and thinks he can join in on the hate. I think it is clear that there is a double standard on who is forgiven and who is not. The vocal majority of Youtube hates the Paul brothers, so they won't forgive him. But they like Pewds, so he is cleared of all wrong doings.
He said in his vid to his fans dont defend my actions
So youre okay with logan showing a dead body to all of his retarded 12 yr old fans?
It's sad that people actually support him still. I mean, young children are watching! He's 22!!! As a 22 year old you should have the common sense not to do that. It's not right, imagine a young kid watching him. This is a Very bad impression.
Edit 1: wow I didn't expect so many likes. BTW ITS MY OPINION PEOPLE
SmolBowl OfRamen Preach it man! 
Tyler Rankin // true !! People should back off
Michigan Football Go Blue! // I know they need to back off
Shut up
That's one of the reasons why those sort of people will become careless and reckless in the future
Oh my lord
Special
He APOLOGIZED ok...
THIS IS ON ABC NEWS TOO HAHAHHA
Srly hes trash
okay if youre raising awareness then why are laughing at the end of your video ?
Dude should be made to cut Down and Clean and Prepare the body For funeral Talk to family and all...  then Degradation Until he wants to kill Himself but only let him try and fail over and over again.
Its never done by anyone on youtube because they have the decency to not post a suicide. Fuck logan paul
He's such a fucking dumbass
The best argument would be to show suicidal people the fate they'd suffer if they did it...
this actually a good thing maybe he might have his channel terminated
Kids won't care. If anything,  this moron will probably get more subscribers. Glad I didn't grow up with this generation.
He messed up
He didnt really mean any bad intention . Hes young and still learning. Hes already sorry for what he did. Just hope him be more aware
Meg Luo I'm younger than him and I know right from wrong. He's just a disgrace
So filming the body, talking about his pockets and not calling the police, and also being loud is suicide prevention? wow this guy is just horrible
I cant believe this happened. He was trying to make A point guys 
Malcolm G Nope he already got views
Hailey M. Nope he was going for views
Is he dumb thats against the YouTube guidelines and the law this boy is dumb asf he needs to stop posting sh** like this he has kids watching this and kids are looking up to him like whats there to look up to this is just crazy
I cant believe its Logan that did this & not jake
no one has o be so mean about yes he messed up buy no one has to be so mean about it.
DON'T LETYOURKIDSWATCHJAKE ORLOGANPAUL
*Don't let your kids watch it!* - Robbie Rotten
rebecca lewis theyre both morons doesnt matter
now ur gonna bring jake paul into this he has nothing to do with it
I hate Logan 
Dumbasses u all don't get hate yet you guys are talking bout dead bodies and worse fuck u guys
After finding the dead body a Japanese man that seemed like a police told him you need to respect the area, you cant enter. What was he doing there? He went to a place he wasnt allowed to, he filmed the dead body, kept laughing and making jokes. That forest became kind of attraction for youtubers... Its just unbelievable.
Leave my logan ALONE
Houlay Sesey you are brainwashed
I KNOW... LOGAN WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE "CAN GET MOTIVATE" BUT HE'S STUPID.. AND HE LOOK EVEN MORE STUPID. HE DID THAT IN A WRONG SITUATION... "IF" I WAS YOUR FAMILY *even tho i don't want to* i will burried myself and acted like i didn't know who you are.
He should go to jail. Disgusting and disrespectful.
a guy i know died and alot of people are making fun of it and know how to react logan did not know how to react
He gets what he deserves
Damn hes already on the news
Its subscribers not followers 
Logan paul and his family is all fucked up.
This is so stupid he made a mistake like he said I hope this has never happened to anyone on YouTube and he said at the start to get help if havering. Suicidel thoughts
Like your not
cupcake twins you are brainwashed
He technically exploited a dead body for views
This news report made Logan Paul look like less of a cunt than he has always been, reeeeee at least the footage they use is cancerous enough to showcase who he really is.
Ease up on logan
Jesus Christ its only the second day of 2018
Make him lose his YouTube money aka job and let him work for what he is qualified McDonalds Dam kids
you know what he does not deserve to be in the news he just said sorry. AND CELEBRITIES DONT YOU DARE CALL HIM TRASH YOU ARE TASH AND NOT HIM SO STOP!!!!!!!!!
what do you mean??
Gabriela Mora you are brainwashed
Hes really annoying
Adrienne shut the fuck up its not like Logan Paul is a bad guy hes the total opposite. I personally dont watch his channel because its gay but dont make it seem like hes the worst man in the world on YouTube and kids shouldnt watch him.
I still support Logan Paul 
Michigan Football Go Blue! Heck yeah...
Mina The Raichu yea pretty much and everyone has different opinions just sticking to mines ...like it's the first time that someone has broken a law in a different country ...just get over it
Keep supporting him David I will too
DAVID ROMAN You support a man that broke the law in Japan and has no sense of humanity in him?
Logan Paul is horrible person! I have never liked him but now I actually hate him!
The broken plates has its revenge.
Raising awareness?
Logan Pauls way is raising awareness is making fun of people who took their Lives.
Greggory Lee I honestly never watched the video xD
Exactly. Even if he *was raising awareness,* he conducted it very poorly - because from my view; it seemed as if he was *snickering, hoarding and freaking out over the body.* Even if it was _nervous laughter (to cope)_ the "awareness" he was displaying was negative towards the body, and it was very disrespectful.
If he wants to conduct a *suicide awareness message,* he should've called a team of professionals (who can handle these scenarios much better than his witty friends) or at least donated to a *suicide hot line.* It's not that hard, and he didn't have to make it so over-the-top.
Suicide is truly no joke, and by raising awareness, you are saving people's lives. I don't know who's lives he really "saved" here, all I felt was him laughing/hoarding around a corpse.
rebecca lewis so I guess u support people killing themselves by telling me to be quiet when I say its bad to promote suicidal attempts? Bruh.
But how is it his fault he did give people a warning from the begging of the fucking vlog
Hes inappropriate he swears and he does bad things
Erm stop showing the video he deleted it said sorry no need to have it on YouTube still
I will always love Logan (: made one mistake and now hated. Stupid
Morgan Cantee you are brainwashed
Raising awareness my ASS!!! He needs to GO! This was WAY WAY WAY OVER THE LINE... SUSPEND HIM
Luckily for me i have NOT seen the video and never will see it as it has been deleted before i found it but I found out about it when the Eh Bee Family parents talked about it
GMA actually said jake paul instead of logan paul
Yes he does
Can kids read the title
He should have stopped filming and called the cops
And the persons face was covered
He doesnt deserve this hate !! I AM A JAKEPAULER BUT STILL I AM A LOGANG PAULER AND HE DOES NOT DESERVE THIS !!
Malcolm G umm did I ever said I was brainedwash ?
Savageboyplayzz XD you are brainwashed
Wow people are quick to destroy someone big.
Anthony Cruz nope we are quick to destroy someone who is a cancer to the next generation
But can we talk about the video was age restricted and he had a warning before he showed it sooooo....
Gabby Pickett that means jack shit if you fully understand the thing he did
Logan.. are unbelievable
If they tell logan paul to delete his channel I'm a wear my maverick merch
i do not like haters
I lost a friend to suicide....... the only hater is you defending this awful person
Jayden Huntington And I don't like brain-dead people.
And I don't like people that record people that have committed suicide and have a laugh about it.
Fck Abc  news... !!!
I'd never even heard of this guy before now, but he looks annoying as hell.
Wolfy Girl 404 what bitch
Benjamin Crew BISH WHAT THE FUCK
Benjamin Crew have you lived under a rock for the past like 12 months?
Luke Skywalker your a fucking BITCH
Braedyn Clark He is you dumb fuck.
We should never forgive him. His friends and him were smirking and laughing in the background of the video. YOUTUBE MUST GIVE HIM A STRIKE
@Jameel Razzaq stop with that "coping mechanism" bullshit. You're litteraly not fooling anyone. And you can stop defending that piece of shit.
@Yulissa Lucio were you born stupid?
Yup, that's why there's a DEAD BODY in the thumbnail.
DIY QUEENS I know
Otaku Cat he made a mistake hes a 22 year old guy who has a bunch of money and is influenced by it so stfu anyone of us coulda done the same thing and we wouldnt want shit like this being said to us we would want to be forgiven hes a fucking human noone is perfect
Ashley longan did not record it Brandon did so just stop
For those that are unfamiliar with Logan Paul, this is him in a nut shell: 
Self centered, talentless, manipulative, hypocrite, racist, liar are just the few things that can be said about him. 
Whats really sad is that there is still a debate about which is the worse Paul brother, Logan or Jake? 
Those two are living proof that you can be talentless and still rise to the top.
RackRacka did the same thing and no one said anything about it ft.Rey Mysterio
ABC New can you please take this off 
At least show some respect for Logan and the Logang
Recently in Korea, a man tried to talk to his doctor about depression but the doctor said he just had voices in his head. He passed on December 18th of suicide. People in Asia want to talk to people but they ain't getting the help they need. I don't care if killing yourself is a sin, if there is a God he would accept all because according the bible we are all his children.
adrian im 13 and don't rattle any one else that "how old are you 12? 6? 10?" I believe in christ and you maybe not believe in it but its true! I know asia has the highest suicide rates but still you have to talk about the despression your having.
wesley swag productions sweetie how old are you? 12? Everyone has different beliefs and religions. Dont give me that hes going to hell for committing suicide because not everyone believes in that. I, myself am atheist. But moving on, sometimes opening up about depression isnt easy. Especially in asian countries where mental illnesses are avoided because people over there believe it isnt serious. Thats why asia has the highest suicide rates, theyre not funding for these type of things.
adrian but that guy killed himself and now he's in hell! he could have talked to his family about how he has depression! that guy chose to kill himself I don't know why everyone is hating on logan! and yes I would care if one person from my family died but killing yourself? thats the wrong choice!
Imagine if the dead body was a family member of yours, would you still have respect for Logan? Him laughing at the your deceased family member and making jokes. It sounds awful right? Well imagine how the family who has someone missing, is feeling. Logan deserves no respect. Even if he did apologize, he still fucked up so badly.
*Cheap and provocative, it will sell!*
AM STAYING SUBSCRIBED I DONT CARE WHAT THOS OTHER PEOPLE SAY HE DIDNT MEAN TO DO THAT AND HE WASNT THE ONE STILL RECORDING IT, SO THE PERSON WHO WAS COULD HAD STOPED RECORDING. CANT BELIEVE THOS OTHER PEOPLE WHO JUDGE SO EASILY. #istillloveloganpaul
Kawaiiwolf 1987 he still uploaded it. He's wrong this is not a 'mistake' this is being disrespectful and rude. Whoever supports him has REAL problems because this is just disgusting.
This is acctulay trending
Far you went too far
This made him even more popular lol
jtk133 lol, at least someone knows that :D
He did this because he wants attention,like the spoiled kid that he is.
And YOU give it to him.Let this piece of crap be forgot it!
golden Ummmmm
I think theres something wrong with your brain
Shut the hell up you little spoiled brat
Kitty go fuck yourself, your assumptions and your shitty use of # for everything,(See I can make assumptions too) you basic bitch. You even have crown of flowers,so cringy!
San R nope. I will support him forever and ever even though he did wrong
San R wow #copycat everyone saying the same freakin thing!
Hmm, Whenever I saw TV shows about the Suicide Forest, I don't remember the host cracking jokes by a dead body while wearing an Alien hat from Toy Story... This dude isn't raising awareness.
Yes relate to that news
Yes everyone deals with death differently, but it's how you present yourself that makes the biggest difference. Everything is edited together to show him and his friends laughing at a dead body. He could have gone into some "real talk" about suicide and given awareness of it. Especially since he was going to the suicide forest.
y tf would he be mourning after a guy he had never seen before in his life?
123 456 Honestly 
Go get a nice hotdog and fucking choke on it
HOMINIX he is a true piece of shit
UGGGHHHH STFU........AND i know imma get hate but idgaf...yes i know its sad they that person killed himself and i know depression is not a joke and suicide is not a joke but there is probably videos out there that we dont know about that show people going into that forest...UGHHH CALM YOUR TITS PEOPLE....you probably think im insensitive now but idc....
1:58 Lets talk up logan paul at the end of the video why?
Big Shield THESE VIDEOS ARE OVER DISLIKED AND I CHECKED!!!!POLICE REPORT SAID IT WAS A DEAD BODY.wtf?
Big Shield first of all,police reported it but didn't say it was fake and there was an article saying it isn't fake?You can't confirm anything here,Let the people kte theirselfs.
End Boss hahaha!So True!Lack of empathy.
*Ruins the Young audience empathy by making Fun Of dead Body.*
joshkeatley yj089o
*TURNS OUT THE DEAD BODY WAS FAKE, POLICE SAID IT WAS A STAGED SUICIDE, NOT REAL* Looks like after all this drama the suicide in Logans vlogs was *FAKE* . The police confirmed this a few days ago. I linked to their statements in a public youtube playlist for those that asked. honestly can't believe this
Oh please, he's not sorry. He's probably enjoying all the attention.
GamerVsWorld you said you're self he's a 22 yrs old that's old enough to know what he's doing, I get it your a fan but you got to take in acount he DID SOMETHING WRONG!! Im not gonna talk about this shit because I feel stupid hopefully this helped you to wake up.
Child listen I know but being a 22 year old he probably wasn't thinking at the time he said sorry you have no idea man how bad he feels
And should not be tolerated
GamerVsWorld AHAHAHAHAHAHHA YOU older than me? C'mon if you're older than me then you would have realise that the action's logan commited should be taken onto action even if you're a fan or not.
I am probably way older than u and also get a life bro. Logan is a cool dude. Man I probably have done worse and got forgiven
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=jiqeiREkfl8
One of the most popluar stars on youtube? Never herad of him until now.
Logan does not deserve this negativity on him he even said that "suicide is not funny,don't play around with it"BUT YA DID NOT LISTEN.
Melanie Martinez you are brainwashed he contradicted himself and made jokes about it
im kinda sad cause im only 10 years old and im a fan of him....idk what to do....
XxLilly xX stop watching him is a good place to start. Trust me kiddo he is not a good role model. Imagine someone close to you committed suicide and some guy makes a video about it and shows it to the world
Yall all doing way to much
1k dislikes are from Logans die hard fans who defend him over anything he does wrong 
I'm not sticking up for Logan because he said not to but I think everybody just needs to let it go everything is done nothing can be changed Logan took down the video and apologized and whether or not everybody forgives him we all make big mistakes in our life and that's what we learned from
Eventually, bad decisions stop being 'mistakes' and start becoming choices. He made a bad choice, and now guess what? He should face the consequences for it, whatever they may be. #NoMercy
Logan didnt take down the video, YouTube did. Logan just wanted views and thats as clear as day.
1. Im not sticking up for Logan Paul, we need to let this go sounds like you sticking up for Logan Paul. 
2. Our goal is for him to stop YouTube, hes cancer.
Your literally sticking up for Logan dude. Mistakes? Yea, they can be forgiven but making fun of a dead man and recording it. Thats a HELL NO. Even with common sense, people know not to do that but Logan in this case did that.... Nope, nope. Maybe after several hundred years where he actually shows sincere apology and actually learns about human nature then.... Maybe
Tho I highly doubt it
Yes yes so true. Now the news needs to see this.
What does Japan do to those people for punishment?!...
He's all over the news
Wasn't he in the news a few months back for doing something else really stupid???
Everything that the news reporter is definitely not a lie aparantly he gets paid by people to post videos yes he gets paid by YouTube and thats it the rest is bulshit the make up so much shit
The thing is he would have never filled the dead body if they had shut down suicide forest and he would never have this problem and if anyone saw the video he posted he said why are there kids running around when the forest is called suicide forest and there are a lot of other people posting in appropriate videos that children can just access but they don't want to take those videos down #logang4life
He didnt take down the video YouTube did
The Yety is the $200,000 vehicle
I find it hard to believe & comprehend that his "intentions" where to raise awareness towards suicide like really?? We all know in reality the true intentions where to get more views & in turn receive a heck amount of money for this STUPIDNESS!
GUYS STOP HE LITERALLY APOLOGIZED HE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT GUYS TELL ME U GUYS DON'T DO MISTAKES U GUYS DO AND HATE ALL U WANT BUT PEOPLE ACT DIFFERENT IN REAL LIFE SITUATIONS HE ACTS DIFFERENT AND WE DO TO SO GUYS STOP CAUSE IF U HAD A BIG CHANNEL LIKE HIM AND MADE A MISTAKE THEN EVERYONE WILL HATE U AND U WOULDN'T WANT THAT THAT'S LITERALLY HIS JOB AND HE KNEW HE WAS GONNA GET HATE BUT HE CONTINUED ON TO MAKE ENTERTAINMENT FOR US AND YOU GUYS GO CRAZY OVER A MISTAKE HE MADE AND HE FEELS BAD GUYS HE DOES AND BTW ABC TOOK THIS TO GET VIEWS AND MONEY TOO SO EVEN THEY NEED CONTENT SO CHILL OUT WITH THE HATE AND LOGANG STAND UP FOR THIS HATE HELP LOGAN CAUSE NO ONE CAN BREAK THE LOGANG WE ARE HUGE GUYS
Rika Kim and I'm not arguing so u shouldn't either
Rika Kim ik but is it really helping us out they pretty much made him more known then he already is
don't put ABC News into this, they're uploading a video like this to give attention to parents with young children that may be watching his videos. They are making any kind of fucking drama
guys and i knew  u agree in what I just said
guys listen up I'm tired of hate and I'm pretty sure u guys are too but now in days everything is about drama and hate and being "savage" I mean I just wish that one day us as humans can lay of that fr why the drama there was no need the hate I understand what he did was wrong but ABC had to take it and make it to total drama and I hate drama this is stuff I wish can change in us humans now in days but I'm pretty sure it isn't gonna happen
Allegedly!? NO HE DID
I saw the video before it got taken down
My sister committed suicide so there is nothing Logan Paul can do to make up for this. This wasnt funny, this wasnt a joke or a mistake, that was a disrespectful, disgusting video.
He gave them amens than that man then would have had
Hey Paul brothers, if youre reading this, delete your channel!
What a way to start 2018
logan paul is not arrogant man he made apology post
i understand that he made a mistake but quit
stormie nelson you are brainwashed
And he laughed about it on his vlog! He just showed his true colors. All about money,  likes, subscribes, fame, money, money, money... Disgusting behavior.
Logan is now gonna be known by every body in the world
Yep going back to Jake Paul
People are ignoring the fact that the guy who hung himself is in Hell. Sad.
Finally this white Troll gets what he deserves .. 
Guys get over it..he apologized and that's enough..And if you see the video that wasn't his freaking fault....what about the other person? Like WTF???!!!
Malcolm G I am not brainwashed...bitch listen Logan didn't mean to joke
Emily Noah you are brainwashed why would he go in the suicide forest other than to find a dead body to exploit for views
I hate Logan Paul
Tbh probably woulda done the same thing
Logan Paul is a complete jackass. He blocked me back in 2015 on twitter 
This makes me so angry. Everybody will get mad for a couple of days and maybe some of his sponsors will drop me, but it wont matter in the long run. People will still watch him and his videos.
Stupid man
I like how all his fans are saying "He copes WITH HUMOR!" So when his family members die, is he going to be laughing and telling Jokes to the whole world while recording it and upload it to YouTube ?
Mona Contreras "You are important, so I'll record your dead body and post it on youtube". Yeah, Logan Paul did a great job indeed.
Aunt is still family but im sure not as close as parents, sister and brother. I like to see his reaction when his brother Jake Paul dies then. See if the jokes will come out.
Actually, his aunt passed away awhile back. He brought out his humor to cope. People want to sweep mental illness, depression and suicide under the rug but his message in the video was "you are important, you are loved...seek help". He posted hotline numbers in Japan, UK and US.
joe cole He probably will be
I dont get this
Suicide victim? Why victim ? Dumb ass took his life no one put gun on his head
Damn this shit hit the news?
They make it seem like Logan is a monster Logan keeps kids from actually killing them selves!
I call bull
6 MILLION
"He makes millions of dollars"
Yeah right. Pay from yt is so small that only pewdiepie can live from it.
"Allegedly"
Can u guys stop please i love logan paul and everyone makes mistakes i know u guys u to say logang4life AND THAT MEANS 4LIFE and now what it was just a what?? a joke come on guys please forgive logan niw yall are just making him feel bad what about that time when he made a speech i know yall cried bc i did i will always be in the ligang NO MATTER WHAT AND I WILL PRAY FOR HIM SO HE WONT LOSE HIS CAREER AND IF HE LOSES HIS SUBS IT WILL NOT MATTER BC ITS BETTER THAN LOSES HUS CAREER AND I KNOW IF ALL OF YALL HATERS!! MADE A MISTAKE AND YALL ALMOST LAST YOUR CAREER I KNOW YALL WOULD'VE FELT BAD HE IS DOING HIS BEST TO MAKE IT UP TOO YALL AND YALL JUST PUSH HIM DOWN NOW YALL DONT KNOW WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING RIGHT WHERE HE IS JUST PLEASE GIVE HIM A CHANCE
He can go fuck himself.
You say it's a joke, but for the family of the dead man, it's very serious. There is this thing called cause and effect. The cause is that Logan made the choice to upload that video. What is happening now is the effect. People are pissed and Logan may lose his career. At the end of the day, was the "joke" really worth it?
mito gillermo ytgtyjj n
You are the most ignorant child ever. Just because you "love" Logan (which btw he and his brother have done enough messed up bullshit to not deserve your so-called love) that doesn't mean what he did was simply a mistake or that we should just forgive him automatically. It will take a while for people to forgive him, if they even try to. I never liked him or his brother in the first place, but now, I won't even give them a chance. You absolutely DO NOT film someone's dead body multiple times and then post it with you and your friends joking and laughing about it. Now any rational person would make a video of them sitting down and they would talk about what they saw and give a speech or something about suicide prevention, with ZERO photos or clips of the body. Now even after reading this paragraph and you still support him, get the hell off of YouTube and read a book, gain some fucking common sense.
mito gillermo You can still enjoy his videos and support him. But he still did something absolutely horrible, he used someone's death for views...
Stop he apologized so chill
Malcolm G no im not ok if ur gonna hate then go somewhere else
Beth Altamirano you are brainwashed
FUCK OFF ALREADY!!!
See I used to like Logan Paul but now...Nah. I can't believe I'm saying this but now I like Jake more than him, even though I'm not watching either of them ever again.
If he wanted to raise awareness he should of donated or said something about it on a heart to heart video but of course this is Logan Paul we are talking about he'll do anything for views even drink bleach
I watch Logan Paul
New Year, same bullshit.
He lacks Empathy what you see here kids is A "Psychopath"
angel torres Have you ever noticed how a lot of rich people have more money than they could ever spend, but it's never enough for them and that'll they'll do just about anything to get more?  This guy is the same.  If he can find a way to get more views, he'll do it no matter how morally bankrupt it is.  It's not like he's going to decide that he doesn't need more views.
Benjamin Crew anyone with common sense could tell that he didnt even need that video to get views lmfao
Aaliyah Lo A Njoe Anyone with common sense will come to the same conclusion.  This scumbag exploited a dead body to get views.  Judging doesn't really even enter into it.  Almost every system of moral values in the world would see what he did as deplorable.
Yea, he really seems to check off all of the boxes. Disturbing that someone like that has a fan-base of mostly children.
Disgusting my little cousin tried last year to make me watch this idiot...I watched the first video and said hell no!
Logan does not do it for views. Logan is amazing and he inspires a lot of people out there. He said SORRY and that's all that matters
LOGANG for life
Malcolm G Ok my mistake sorry
The epic Gamer you are brainwashed and a child. Sorry will never solve it. Would if someone close to you committed suicide and some guy comes along and cracks jokes about it. Would sorry help then
Logan and Jake both of them still have childish mined.
Did she just say followers on youtube  wut
"he made a mistake!"
Well if he truly realized his mistake he should not have
#1 Filmed the corpse
#2 Edit the footage into the video
#3 Put the body on his THUMBNAIL
#4 upload it.
Not buying his apology either, he knows what he did.
Aelita1234 Putting the body on the thumbnail is terrible! He already knew what he was doing but didnt think of the fallout. One last thought before uploading this video... I want to be groundbreaking...
@Sarifeth Irias did you really need like TEN explanation points in one comment?
FACT!!!!!!!!!!
@Olivier E were you born stupid? Logan Paul did not realize his mistake, and you can stop defending him like he's your Lord and savior. Also, you can stop with the lol's in your shitty comment because it's not funny, you sick fuck.
@Abbi Ravindhran were you born stupid? He obviously filmed the body and put it in the thumbnail, and ONLY edited the face out. And you honestly don't know why Sophie Turner is talking when she's a part of an HBO show based around severing and killing? Maybe because the show is not real, you piece of shit. And you're right, we are jealous. Jealous that your brainless idol had the audacity to film a corpse and put it YouTube for millions to see while cocksuckers like you defending him like a god when scum like you are equally as braindead as HE is. And he did NOT realize his mistake. He did it just get views and money.
#logang
Why does Japan anyway have a suicide forest where anyone can walk in and Logan did put a warning before the videos , so he did nothing wrong
Skatch HD It's called the suicide forest because it's dead quiet and numerous, and I do mean NUMEROUS, people go there every year to commit suicide. There are signs everywhere that tell people that if they do feel like going in and not coming back out to reconsider. They have the number for the suicide hotline. They urge them not to. But it still happens. Every year, there is a body hunt to search for the poor souls. All visitors there are urged to stay on the path. He did not. He broke Japanese law in not alerting authorities and filming the body. He strayed from the path. And you sound like you are blaming Japan for the forest, "Ao Kigahara" or "The Sea of Trees" for its misfortune. Shame on you. I hope your parents slap some sense into you
Skatch HD 
He went into the restricted area of the forest actually
There are areas that are blocked off
Skatch HD Even tho he put a warning he fucking recorded a dead body
I'm sorry but I'm a Jake Pauler now oh well Logan that was really bad to do :(
News i dont like u
how dislikes did that video get
Its even on the news?!?!?
He doesn't care. His apology doesn't mean crap. He's just saying whatever he can to get himself out of the hot water and make himself seem better than the scum he his.
So...is this the fall of LOGAN Paul?
Instagram Daily lit ayyy
Angel Queen lets hope not
Angel Queen no
Nope. Cuz his army of brainwashed fans wont care
Angel Queen well things that rhyme are usually true so I guess
He's a spoiled rich kid, why is this shocking he would do something so low? Their soulless, look at Trump.
He didn't even show the body he covered the the body when he edited it
Carley Delmastro he showed the hands. Boy have you seen the video
Millions of dollars in endorsement deals? Do your homework, he hasn't done brand deals in years.
his career is done
I used to like Logan but now I don't and Logan does it for views and money
It really got started
If I would found a dead body I would tie a rope to it's legs and make a swing out of it.
He needs to be investigated I mean who doesn't know that he didn't kill that man
tbh i would think jake paul would do this not logan. well, i was wrong.
I saw it.......
why was he so popular he is a idiot people need to get a life
#FUCKLOGANPAUL
FrosTx Clan sorry
pigmaster peace #FUCKLOGANPAUL
Tho I'd never fuck a disgusting and horrible person like that
Jeff Horton ikr it's disgusting how they support him after all the sh*t he's done and this one passed everything an yet they still support him 
Brainwashed kids
pigmaster peace // I know you ant talking to me
Well Instagram Daily lit use the word bitch like your mom
I think Logan meant to say in that tweet I only did it for the movie cause i don't give a shit about anyone
"He has 15 million followers on YouTube."
BRU I SAW THE VID BEFORE IT WAS DELETED
What a wonderful way to start of 2018.....
Annnddd, here comes all the 8 year olds coming in and blindly following and forgiving him.
"Raised awarness" he didn't say a single thing that helped throughout the entire video. What a lie.
So what.....?
f*** the people on Game of Thrones
Hes on tv holy frick
OMG STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS PLEASE
holy fuck everyone is talking about logan paul now
This is not ok for him to think that this is ok to post someone how did not give him permission to do this its not right this was not a Mistake he never had a thought in his mind that oh this is for people to stop having thoughts about killing yourself this is not OK
what a great way to kick off 2018
The Paul brothers just want money. Jake Paul is very open about that, all those songs about buying his merch is literally him singing about wanting people (kid's parents) to give him money so he could be a billionaire.
He is saying posting a video of someone who committed suicide is to to prevent suicide What. 
He could of just turned of the camera called the cops and left .
The family should sue his ass.
RAISING AWARENESS?!
ARE YOU JOKING.
MY COUSIN DIED FROM SUICIDE
YOU ARE NOT RAISING AWARENESS
You know why Japan doesnt even release the numbers of suicides deaths for this forest?? They dont want to bring too much media attention or attract anyone with suicidal thoughts. There are even signs everywhere asking people to get help. Its called respect and human decency, and he just used an actual dead body as click bait
Are people disliking this video because of what Paul did or is it because they don't like people bashing on him? I never heard of him until I heard about this incident. Logan really seems like a jerk who wants nothing more than money.
The time everybody turns to a jake pauler lol
Jesus Christ the video came out yesterday and hit the news today god damn
Damn he so stupid like what you doing dude you dont freaking post a video with a suicidal person who killed them selves like jeez
Society making him famous. Is this how low society has become.
Petition to kick Logan Paul off planet Earth
Please do I would sign that so fast I have wanted him to be kicked off YouTube and the face of the earth for a long time
Make him be part of that SpaceX mission to mars..
Mr Clean 
You make it, Ill sign it.
This is #5 on trending
Hes an idiot. I dont understand why people like him so much.
The thing he did wrong is uploading a video with a deadbody in it to kids,most of his subscribers are 6-16 years old you don't show that to kids
You bitches need to shut up
Way to start 2018
His only 22 yh thats grown enough to know whats right and whats wrong.
rebecca lewis he's bloody 22 
He should at least have some humanity in him to cut out the scene or something
But he showed it and laughed whilst making jokes
Yeah. He had plenty of time to - you know - *cut out or severely blur the body, right?* But no. He just hoards around the body and snickers with his friends.
he still has A lot to learn people
How dare you hate on Logan he really was trying to make an influence of positive energy out to everyone who was watching not to commit suicide and talk to someone before you even think about doing it.
Irene Sizemore you are brainwashed
Can we all just back off please, this man is a human, a famous human but still a human being with every single emotion that any one of you have. He has a sense of humour and he has a sense of sorrow and he is exactly like any one of you guys. Forget Logan be ashamed of himself, Im ashamed of every single ok eod you people who are harassing his Instagram and Twitter. Yes he made a grave mistake- but dont we all. Yes maybe you shouldnt have done that but its a difficult situation to react in and no one is expected to be perfect, so why is he? If someone like- anyone- made this mistake, anyone who wasnt famous, they would not receive this kind of backlash, therefore why should Logan? When I first saw what happened I was pretty angry with him, but after reading all the Mean comments and tweets on his social media I wasnt shocked with Logan anymore I was shocked with humanity. How could anyone say things when they where not at all in his position. Logan has apologised on multiple platforms, he said he isnt to be forgiven but people still have a go like he isnt a human being who has emotions. Logan looked like he was nearly in tears in this video yet you still have to be idiots. So on a final note, Logan paul is a very famous YouTuber, a very famous YouTube who made a mistake. And the word famous had blinded everyone who has been wicked towards him. Just because hes famous doesnt mean hes not allowed to make mistakes, because everyone makes mistakes. Logan I was shocked but I respect you for everything! Forever love ~ Like every single member of the Logang who is triggered af right now 
Btw dont get all triggered guys Im posting this to every fucking single video that has Logans name in it just try me bitches, just try me.
Wolf Blossom xox you are brainwashed
"He's only 22."
Yeah, you should be mature enough at 22.
@Ashley Cooper you are kidding, right?
@Itz Niko one year later, look at your comment to see the stupidity
NHMO OYTIS another person that thinks millennials are trash.
Noah Munoz Cooper Nope, you should be mature enough to not film a dead body by 5.
idot True
I agree with the showing of the body why are suicide victims of young and if someone who is thinking about taking their life watches most will not and advise how bad a suicide can lead to.
Saddest thing is his fans still support and defend him.
@Aaliyah Lo A Njoe do you want me to make you a list about the times he fucked up?
Polo Lavish the n word is a word. You can hear it most of the time especially among the black society. It's not really that bad. It just a word. But this is a dead person. A dead body..you don't see a dead body anywhere.
adog 350 shut up bet 100 dollars your a 12 yr old white girl, jeez hes a idiot and a bad impression!!
Saddest thing is for you not to realise that logan is still a human being who makes mistakes
Fernanda Castillo your a good example of how retarded logangers are
Parents, please pay attention to the things your children are interested in. He has a massive following of young teenagers, who are DEFENDING HIM over this!! They need some serious correction if they can't see why this is disgusting.
Shit this stuff has got not the news . Man this is crazy he was totally in the wrong
The first thing that happens in 2018 what a shame
15 million....followers?
But seriously...go to hell logan
omfg does every little thing put on YouTube have to be taken serious
livedtitan7057 you saying this is little
He's so dumb. He's one of the most retarded 22 year olds in the world.
He obviously did it for views because he continued to film the dead body which is extremely disrespectful. How has YouTube not taken down his channel, people do simple things and their channels get flagged but nothing happened to him......wow
Who the f is this clown, if teens today follow this clown, USA is doomed.
1st off he did it for views I mean there was nothing in his video that helped any kind of awareness 2nd to make things worse he laughed at the thought of him seeing a dead body for the first time which is fucked up 3rd the YouTube establishment handpicked his video to be trending when YouTube has demonetized content that was less as bad as this video.
Conclusion: YouTube is a cunt for enabling videos like this happen
Who fucking watches this fake shit lol its like for 5 year olds
Im ganna unsub from Logan and sub to Jake
I've been through Vine, Youtube, Instragram etc. I'm an fpv pilot, so from a creater an outside opinion, this individual truly has killed himself over night. His social media demographic is generally children and he posted a video that has zero respect for humanity.  Actions speak louder than words. Regardless of a mistake, judgement, choices, death isn't a joke. Honestly YouTube is better off without him considering YouTube is here for inspiring, to push people, to be greater! His message through his videos may appear to him as that; but it's actually encouraging kids to be more disrespectful throughout the world! May he learn from this, and hopefully have 0 subscribers!
I always like Logan more than hake but this was fucked up n disrespectful to the dead person n if u were trying to raise awareness then plz do it the right way I mean I'm not trying to sound rude or com off on the wrong way but still have respect dude n what's messed up is that he's making money for his fuck up with YouTube
logang sidint men to
Emmanuel Perez yes he did not mean to hit the upload button
You guys forgot one thing that he says in the video. He says I think this definitely marks a moment in YouTube history. You forgot that he says that he hopes that this has never happened to anyone. People really like to forget the positive parts of things like this. You highlight the negatives and completely screw over his positive message. And btw Im not some triggered 6 year old.
Good Times With Wretch ! If your not 6 than you are brainwashed
Am I wrong?
Well what would you do? Hint: you would call the police and film it send to Snapchat,tweeter,Instagram and more
Ohhhh boy
Stop posting videos about this is making more drama
It's one thing to actually film the body when you're there, but then to keep the footage and upload it? Wow. They should have stopped filming and talked about suicide prevention without filming around the body.
2018 is off to a great start, eh?
Go to a channel called kavos and dislike all his videos
At 2:17 yea you got that wrong woman it is 300,000 dollars get it straight
He knew that this would go big ALSO did it for money
Ok although he acted irresponsibly, he actually did apologize, which is a first from  him...
Why would he do that I mean like
He is always will be scum and his apology is worth nothing.
I wonder why fucking does stupid stuff I mean Jake does stuff too but this was bigger than what Jake does just saying horrible you tuber dont let your kids watch him
Their not followers lady their subscribers on YouTube
I watch good morning America
i had nightmares about the dead body i felt bad but logan paul he was laughing smh
Why I hate him. Now
The forest lives up to its name as Logan Paul commits career suicide in it
Look att 0:15 like they could not choozen and Otter picture?
logan doesnt deserve to be on the news
Sparkle Butt 100% deserve it more because why would video tape of a suicide body. Nope. He could' ve just call the police and ambulance but what he did yep. So stupid when will he change, ik he's fun guy.
Sparkle Butt well he is being shamed on the news. People need to know what he did was horrible. He deserves to receive hate.
Sparkle Butt ur so right I feel so bad for him
Sparkle Butt yes he does.. the man posted a dead fucking body on YouTube. This is why the Paul brothers are the most stupid people on YouTube. I dont understand how anyone thinks they are funny. The man was joking around when he did find it.
U are right
i mean atleast is not a lie, not only clickbait i mean im not scared of dead bodies, ghosts, i would not be scared, but i mean why the hell everybody saying hes career ended? and i mean the laugh is just shows hes brave/ness that hes not that scared, i dont know is just my opinion, where is the logic?
HeS So DuMb
Look I m a maverick which stands that I m Logan Pauls fan and friend but dont post something bad like the one I watched thank u and bye
A week later everyone is going to forget about this and he will continue being stupid and getting rich and nothing will change! So fuck you paul!
I dont understand other youtubers have put up close dead bodies on youtube and no one did anything about it .LOGAN is stilp amazing @loganpaul
He didnt do it for the views, yet he used the poor mans body in the thumb nail as click bait. Fuck out of here with your bull shit. Fucking scum.
He laughed after seeing it though, I don't get how his apology is accepted by anyone. He is only apologizing bc he knows his career is damaged
PEOPLE LISTEN
WHAT LOGAN DID WAS WRONG. END OF. THERE IS NO JUSTIFYIN HIS ACTIONS. IM HEARING PEOPLE SAY " but he doesn't edit his videos" AND???? HOW DOES THAT HELP HIS CASE. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS BEING FILMED. THE ONLY ISSUE ISNT NOT BLURRING THE BODY PROPERLY. NO. THE FACT THAT HE JOKES AROUND AND SHOWS NO RAW HUMANLY EMOTIONS IS PURELY DISRESPECTFUL AND WORRYING. THIS IS A DEAD MAN.  A HUMAN. SOMEONE WITH FAMILY. SOMEONE'S SON. TO HAVE SOME POPULAR GUY USE HIS BODY FOR VIEWS IS DISGUSTING. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING RIGHT ABOUT THAT VIDEO. HE FUCKED UP REAL BAD.
Sadly his followers will never understand the full problem of that
dook. calm yourself, ffs its just logan paul get over it and freaking move on
STOP IT WITH THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS WILL YOU?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU ALL?! DID THE SUICIDE FOREST GET INTO YOUR HEAD AND POSSESSED YOU?! GOD CAN'T YOU GUYS JUST FORGIVE WHAT HE DID OR DO YOU GUYS WANT TO BE SIN FOR COMMENTING AWFUL COMMENTS?!
   I used to like Logan pual sure he made mistakes which is normal for us humans but he laughed at a dead body I can't forgive him for that!
Your right he is a freakin jerk bag!
I only watched a few of Logan Paul videos & he's a pretty cool , fun guy from what I've seen . But damn he fucked up with this .
Omg my sister was one of the first people to watch. WHY WOULD HE POST THE VIDEO !!!!!!!
What the hell does being a 'vlogger' have to do with him being a moron?
Hes a vlogger and he was stressed and didnt know wat he was doing.
Probably because he is a total psycho who gets off on all of the attention he is getting.
Your guess is as good as mine though.
At least he did the right thing called the cops before he even did anything !!!!
Jesus Christ at least he blocked out the face 
And he did another good thing by taking it down
I watched that video and it does kinda raise awareness of suicide prevention
Oh My he got on abc
Hes sooo fucking stupid!! Why is he famous why!!!!  Ewwww
"I intended to raise awareness" and that's by laughing with your friends about it? FO(fuck off)
Wow on news lol
Horrible
REALLY THE NEWS TOOO
Wait Hold up.. Did she just say a growing up experience???  No. This a sign for him to be pulled off social media!!
you are just using Logan for views
I know it's wrong so I'm very aware that what he did was not ok. But everyone makes mistakes like honestly look up people filming funerals and don't blur the faces, and people who find dead people but youtube targets logan paul. I'll even leave a link to the vids
YouTube is drunk again
I thought Jake was a idiot, but no I was wrong. Jake is still an idiot but Logan is a bigger one  I was doing it for awareness my fucking ass. Your a self centered ass hat who posted a dead man online just to get fucking views. You laughed at a FUCKING DEAD MAN. I never thought I would see a day were a idol I looked up to would laugh at a dead man. Kiss my ass Logan my cousin would  know not to laugh at a dead man and shes 5.
Idk really know what to say, I mean we all make mistakes, but, I am fourteen and I have to admit I've done fucked up shit, but never like that, I mean kids are watching, I love Logan Paul #logang4life, but now I'm not so sure... RIP
Well at least you admit he's wrong, and not those logan fans who are DEFENDING THAT IDIOT
It is a bad idea to idolize anyone. People do really bad things sometimes and putting yourself in a position where you feel like you have to stick up for someone that is very obviously in the wrong does no good for you or the people you care about.
There are other people you can watch on youtube that don't do stuff like that. Moving on from him doesn't mean that there is no more entertainment out there. There is an enormous amount of content out there. Find someone that is more worth your time and appreciation.
Ella Anderson just leave...
People will do anything to get views smfh
Fuck you
I HAT YOU ABC NEWS
"apparent"
Omg yeessssssss
Doesn't bother me ... so I mean you guys are really blowing it out of proportion ..
I dont think he mean to do it on purpose like gosh he didnt mean to it was a mistake everybody does a mistake
There should take off YouTube
He apologized and took it down he is an young adult and doesnt think before  he speaks I mean look at all the positive stuff he doe but that doesnt get in the news what I am trying to say is we all make mistakes and we are human we make mistakes but others should forgive but that will not be forgotten (I am not defending him for his mistakes I am saying he know where he went wrong )
allegedly shows a dead body ? he showed a dead body and laughed. thats that.
Do you realize the influence you have on young people!!! How dare you exploit suicide for your own gain...you laughed who does that..you need to get help and go away ...despicable behaviour I am horrified as the whole world is!!!!!
Rip Logans career
Okay Tv... Instead of showing how impacting suicide can be you just made a promotion of his work, good job
I wonder what his mom thinks if this... 
Didn't Sam and Colby do that too? You could see the body in Sam and Colby's video. Is it not as big of a deal because they aren't as popular?
Logannnnnnnn!
Suicide is not a laughing matter.
Thats why Jake Paul is better
well he a maverick so he allowed to exploit dead bodies yall ppl are dumb props to logan 
im jk fuck you logan
Are people to sheltered from reality that they don't feel comfortable enough in seeing a dead body? Grow up, this world isn't made of rainbows and sunshine. The reality of the universe is that we all die, some sooner than others.
Straight up garbage.
Okay one his channel needs to go down and two he's a fucking idiot for doing this and now people in Japan is gonna see others like we're all monsters cause of him
Everybody make mistakes in their life come on people
Laughing is a normal reaction tbh
He is a dope and unfortunately his audience little kids with an average IQ.
Dude it 2018 Logan Paul wow 2018 bro
Logan Paul sucks!!!!!
It must suck to be a dumb ass 22 year old kid
this is just sad he knew better he should have just removed the video apologized he didn't need a lie to make it better
Best way to start 2018 can't wait for youtube rewind this year.
That man had a family.... his family  loved him.... I want him back
This shows people true colors how can this new be looked upon his apologies didnt show emotion he just wanted to look better after that video. if you go to a suicide forest youre not going to find anything happy. Also how can you say you dont do it reviews when the title was found a dead man in the picture for the video was a dead man hanging?
It's the beginning of the end for this  people do what ever for money so sad
Common sense shouldn't be that hard given the situation some people have more views than brain cells
yeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhh im not suprised logan did this
I love Logan but I just learned this and I'm starting to think Jake is a bit smarter
LOGAN PAUL IS CANCELLED
This guy just ended his youtube channel
Earlier today, my friend Lindsay and I were arguing about this. She doesn't think that Logan filming the body was wrong. It's disrespectful. I don't understand how he even has fans? Filming the body of a person that committed suicide is disrespectful to the persons family especially if they're grieving over the death.
Its always 'awareness' bullshiy
Abc needs to hurry up and get this story out of the way so they can go back to exploiting death and disaster for financial gain. It's hilarious to me what hypocrites everyone is being about this.
the sad part is that filthyfrank ended his channel but not Logan
Im still skeptical as to whether the whole thing is real.
shut up stupid ppl. :)
Raising awareness? HE LAUGHED AT THE BODY!!!!!
Are you fucking serious, ABC. "Oh hey a YouTuber is getting hate from the fact there was a dead guy in his video- nobody cares he wins money and drives a Something-Million dollars Worth vehicule lol."
Get fucking over your money ambitions, and start behaving like fucking human beings, what he did is horrible, INSIST ON THAT.
fuck you logan is the best
I actually thought it was good. Because some people might not think the suicide forest is real or that people don't do it. Even if I was wrong, he showed that a person will go out and kill him or herself. Also, you people who make videos about it are blowing it up. He know what he did. You're just doing it to get views.
that is sad cuz he ended his carrer from that video and all the hate
Why is everyone saying he laughed at it. He's not like that. He respects the views of everyone. He didn't show the face.
Besides. Its a vlog! He shows what happens on a daily basis to him
I watched it and I actually threw up
A positive ripple????? wow
Logang4life
#LogangForLife
Youtube got this video on trending! ON TRENDING! And any other content creator is being kicked and demonetized for a simple swear word! Is that fair Youtube?! Is that fair media?!
DID SHE JUST SAY 15 MILLION FREAKING FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE
All these triggered kids try to defend Logan even though he is clearly in the wrong.
Already huh, it's only January and the fuckery is early
He does way to much and needs to stop
just the second day in 2018, and now we have this.
Tbh I think what Logan did isnt right but I Also liked that he still posted that video. He was simply not trying to get views this kid averages 5mil is 24hrs and he was trying to spread awareness for depression mental illness and suicide so you really  cant bash a kid that is trying to do right. And also he demonized his one video so he would not make money off that video so the views thing wouldnt even matter anyway
2018 he already fucked up, 2019 forshooo
"He's only 22... This is a learning experience"? Are you kidding me? When I was 16, I got my drivers license so I can help take my siblings to school. When I got out of high school,  I was sent to college with nothing but my clothes,  a laptop,  a car,  and $50. I had to learn how to cook,  clean,  spend,  as well as get a job on my own before my first semester. 22 years is too damn long for someone like him to be just learning about respecting the dead. 
This "child" is old enough to understand common sense, morality, and basic respect. The fact that none of those things were shown in his video and in his proxy apology letter,  makes me think this guy is either a psycho or has never had anyone in his life telling him the rights and wrongs. 
Remember people. He has a large viewer base of mostly children. The fact he has a big influence over them,  not to mention he probably scared some of them with that video, should worry some of you parents out there.
Oh please he did it for VIEWS that's his job and of course he must keep his views up
It was an accident
This motherfucker would never have apologized if nobody said anything about it. Such a fucking piece of scum. I want to kick this child in the teeth.
Bro the Logang is too strong
He probably doesn't even regret it either he made that choice himself
He is not a child, he did not raise awareness period. He needs some help, because for a second he actually thought it was okay to post someones dead body on the internet for the whole world to see!  Reevaluate yourself logan paul because im pretty sure your "apology" was not sincere at all.
Sabrina carpenter is Queen I totally agree with EVERYTHING you just said
SHUT THE FUCK UP OKAY LOGAN PAUL APOLOGIZED HE'S FUCKING CRUSHED HE'S DISAPPOINTED IN HIMSELF IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT WHAT DO WANT FROM HIM TO SAY SORRY HUH YOU DON'T KNOW HIM WE ALL MAKE FUCKING MISTAKES OKAY WE'RE NOT ALL MR OR MRS PERFECT BUT JUST THINK FOR A SECOND LOGAN POSTED THAT VIDEO TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T THINK OF SUICIDE OR HURT OURSELVES HE WANTS US TO TALK WITH OUR PARENTS IF WE'RE FEELING LIKE THAT OR TALK WITH AN ADULT LOGAN CARES FOR US THAT WHAT'S MAKES HIM A HERO SO STOP SAYING SHIT TO HIM
Danitza Cruz exactly, he was not trying to raise awareness!!
Agreed. He used the old better to ask forgiveness, than ask permission  to an Extremely sensitive issue without so much as a decent warning or discussion on the reasons why someone might consider doing this and hurting themselves and many others in the process ,and how to get help if you feel this way. His apology is because he fears losing followers, I.e. promotion money, I.e. fancy cars and expensive houses . This is truly a sad moment in YouTube history and will challenge each of us to our moral core.
Danitza Cruz bitch how the fuck u have 15m sub..lol
REALLY ABC NEWS. YOU TOO??!!
Lets not be too quick to judge a cancerous person on the internet
Especially not when its the cancer calling out the tumor
I will never buy Pepsi again.
The video was super distasteful. He was not trying to raise awareness at all. In the video when they found the body they were all smiling. That's not the right way, or any way, to raise awareness.
I feel so bad for Logan ... hes ashamed now
stop hating
This is just no...no...Im so sad for him he doesnt deserve hate even tho he did this....
What a cunt
DEBUKLE
Why are people calling him trash and an idiot NOW? He always has been
Fuck Logan Paul. Go to hell
his channel deserves to be deleted if he does something like this do you think he would deserve so many people who like him?
He was not making fun of people the dead person
WTF is wrong with him
How is this trending
Ware Wolf because ppl made a big deal out of it so instead of just his followers knowing and he getting a strike or whatever, it's become a world issue that promotes cyberbullying instead of suicide prevention and also has given all the people who clearly have a lot of free time a new hobby
OMG STOP LEAVE HIM ALONE
"HATE watch"?
Well he did laugh after the incident
HOLY CRAP THIS HIT BIG
He was not trying to get views. The video had 6 million views which is the same amount of views that most of his vids get.
Logan Paul is a terrible human being! Logan Paul just cares about money he is a shitty person
Rip to the people that kill they self
Its subscribers not followers
Im a maverick and I saw that vlog.It was sad
The fact he edited it ( and editing takes some hours). He did not once to ever ask himself is this OK to be posting on the Internet. Will millions of children watch this and not be traumatized. And for this affect my career?
Such a great start to 2018 
Rlly your 22 years old Logan grow the hell up!!!!
DUDE ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL ITS NOT HIS FAULT
Americans, take note, life is not a reality show even though you have a president who is a reality star and your culture is the kardashians.........no respect for anyone or anything.....
damn logan little kids are now gonna start kill themselfs so they can be in your vlog
The trending page!?
HE IS NOT A CHILD. HE KNEW BETTER.
Lol... Second day of the new year and the drama is started
Can he please delete his presence from the internet
Kinda strange when role models are nothing but normal people doing stupid shit on YouTube. Since there are no jobs, I guess this is the new way of life.
My cousin commited suicide so this brought me to tears. How dare he disrespect people and that person. Thats twisted
WHO the hell is Logan Paul? And how can this idiot be so popular after saying "Come meet Amy and I"?!
Stop putting down Logan Paul he was respecting the person and raising awareness idc how much hate I get for this comment you all are wrong
sorry.. did i read that right? "he was respecting the person"???????????? did you watch the video in the first place? even people that talked about the video?
Respecting the body would be not putting the body in the video
This is the stupidest comment Ive seen all day here. He was just respecting the body.... really? Watch the vid a couple more times son maybe youll come to realize he was doing the opposite. And stop crying that he deleted it....the vid is everywhere now..
lmao filming a dead body is disrespectful, stop trying to defend him, HE FUCKED UP, JUST ACCEPT IT.
raising awareness... lmao who is more 'aware' of suicide as a result of this dude posing in front of a person's dead body and making it the title of his video? Were people unaware that suicide happens? It's not your place to say if he was respecting the guy or not. He did this for attention
Logan Paul was sorry then happy all of a sudden after that physco
Thats it!? Trump tweets something and everyone spends hours talking about it, this guy makes fun of a death person posting the video and it doesnt even get 5 mins of coverage and reflection... Also I think Youtube should be a target since they dont just let videos get on the trending page that easily...
i looked it up and the forest that logan went in was a forest that japanese people belive if they kill themselves their spirit will live on forever.........and that is the reason why there are a lot of people who are dead in that forest
also........he only went in there cause he knew there was going to be dead people there..........clickbate no?
Logan and Jake are so insincere
This woman  gave me  the early  morning  weather   in our hometown  on our local news  good for you DCU reporting national news on the national spotlight!!!!!
All the dislikes are from the logang  defending him that he didn't did nothing wrong
I'm unsubscribe Logan your a complete idiot I hope your taken into police custody
I do not care how much hate I get. Logan paul was in  shock and was trying to  lighten the mood. Yes he shouldn't have  filmed it but he is a good person. If your a loganster like this and prove your point. Logan is a good man. So stop hating where is the love?
He finally show us who he really is!
I have never subscribed his channel and i hope that everybody are gonna unsubscribe!!!
The best thing he can do is delete his channel!! That would be really sorry!! 
Such a disqusting and disrespectful reaction just for views :( :(
The worst youtuber ever??
He doesn't do endorsements anymore
He laughed at the dead body, how is he trying to prevent the suicide..
My younger brothers watch his videos and this is making me sick he's a scumbag.  I'm glad I never watched his videos and I hope my brothers won't watch his videos anymore and I don't care if he's saying sorry HE SHOULDN'T OF DONE IT. yeah eveone makes mistakes  but SERIOUSLY HE'S MENT TO BE A GROWN MAN FOR GODDESS SAKE.
This man isn't a youtube star. He is a boring, vapid idiot that children worship. But this is a big corporate news network so I doubt they see the difference or even care.
Either way I am glad he's getting the verbal lashing and outrage he is. Both of the Paul brothers have deserved it  for a long time.
What a _great_ way to start 2018
Oh and also dislike any of content associated with his actions or apology.
Mistake
He made a LOT of mistakes, too many to count. What he did was wrong and horrible. He shouldn't have posted the video, we get that. He has apologized, though. As a Christian, I believe that when some one apologizes it is on the person wronged to forgive. I'm not saying what he did was okay, at all, but we all have made terrible mistakes that we would give anything to undo. If he isn't qualified to help people dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, then who do you think is? Do you expect them to say, "We aren't qualified people to talk to and there probably aren't any that you know." Bottom line: he made a mistake, we all do. He said he's sorry, now we need to forgive him.
Guys it was a fuckin Fake
No one knows what to do when u see a dead body especially when ur recording ur self.... and he is not the only one who has gone there or anywhere and found a dead body and put it on YouTube knowing children watch their channel. So Logan paul had done it, he's not the only one and he apologized and deleted the video. Thank you
What a great way to start 2018...
I hate when people talk shit about him even if they never met him and then say he is a idiot he supports people and don't want people to commit suicide like the man
It's not even about what he showed it's about how we reacted he could have took that and it's not even about what he showed it's about how we reacted he could have took that and did a whole different approach.
BAN LOGAN PAUL FROM YOUTUBE!!!
Kelly Davis in Macon GA 2018
Logan blurred the face guys
Rude!!! Leave him alone he did not now!
Lets all troll his channel and get him off the YouTube.He is a danger for the young and impressionable minds! Protest him!!!
Another youtube channel spent the night in the forest and they found a body
You can secretly sense that all those reporter hate him.
*My kids said they hate him!*
They forgot the part where he made an inappropriate joke next to the man and continued to laugh hysterically
He mentioned before the actual video started that he was going to show that so if his viewers didnt want to see that he said dont watch it
Just shut the fuck up
This is low why and how could you do that to someone and joke about it he is being supported and defended for this bullshit and its sad cuz kids watch him dumbass honestly jake isn't even that stupid . 
R.I.P
my the man rest in peace
Society is way too sensitive. Logan did that man a favor. I wished someone told the whole world I died. Show my hanging body too. I would enjoy the publicity before traveling to the after life land as a star spirit
He will be band from yt
No their has been many bodies out in that forest it isn't his fault
Why is he even well known
ok look he never thaught he was going to see a dead body he posted a video a few hrs ago he feels so sorry stop hating
Dont Attaked him it it his fault its no ones fault
He is turning into his brother Jake. Come on Logan!
I SAW THE VID SUCK IT NORMIES
It's not followers it's subscribers
My f ing god he said sorry
never liked him in the first place
I'm upset seeing all of these videos...
I actually feel bad for him. but yes it was not right to post that video but it is still not right to give death threats to anyone thats just going to far he mad a dumbass mistaken and now there is consequence so yeah and his sorry did seem genuine when he posted the new vid but oh well hopefully he learns from his mistakes
behold the drop of logan paul. He is crazy for views and fame and he uploaded whats not he suppose to. Suicide is not a joke
You did not cover how it was for views because 1) he used the duded photo in the thumbnail to get people to click. 2) the title...   Also you did not cover how youtube put it in the top trending page.  like wtf..
Never thought  I would ever day this but
Jake Paul might have a better attitude than Logan like I don't think he would be stupid enough to post a dead body and laugh about it tbh
Only my opinion don't bash me for it
in hot water ironic cause Im making ramen
HOLLY CRAP. LOGAN PAUL IS A SICKO
hes 22 years old. the crazy thing is that logans video recorder said give me the camera lets go but no logan had to completely show the god danm body.
Logan paul is a poor excuse of a human. I can not believe he would talk, joke, laugh about suicide.
Stupid paul
damn Logan, you fucked up.
They make it sound like people are being negative to attack him??????
He ruined his career
People makes mistakes in life
People need to calm down. People have to step into reality eventually. It happens although it is not ok to commit suicide. But he even put viewer discretion advised and he is against suicide.
Mason O'Brien so if his family dies he would laugh cuz hes in shock right
Trap maybe not weed, but heroine or cocaine. cops need to search his house
Pfft Logan Paul needs to step back into reality. Does he smoke pot or weed or something? By the looks of how he acts...he looks as if he has a mental problem.
Mason O'Brien but he kept recording, he could of just stop and he laughed and also that one girl was laughing
Mason O'Brien so? It is still sick to record/take the time to edit/upload it. It is disrespectfull towards the victim. He even put  viewer discretion advised he should not have uploaded it to begin with. He joked because he was shocked it is still disrespectfull and tasteless no matter How shocked he felt. He had the chance to edit it out/ not upload it but did not think anything was morally wrong  with uploading it anyway, otherwise he would have not done it to begin with. A measly viewer discretion advised warning or his shock does not justify his actions.
Its fake you all are idiots its staged
Fuck him and his stupid so sorry. Video. Hes not sorry he did it for views and he went too far and wants to stay relevant thats the only reason hes saying sorry
Am I the only one that doesnt give a fuck
"growing up experience" he's already a grown man! his behaviour is unacceptable
rebecca lewis this is youtube not English class
learn to spell behavior
he acts too childish for his age as soon as he saw the body he should've turned the camera off and left
CT Myers he's 22...he's still got loads to learn...
Logan you are a disgusting idiot you showed a xd person on camera you are so rude
look at all what you are saying about him you are bullies! the man that was found might of did what he did because of what you people are doing right NOW!!! Logan Paul uploads videos of everything that happens in his life, this happened to be a sad event, nobody had to watch it he clearly stated viewer discretion advised and it's on the name of the video you didn't have to press play!  but yet here you all are bullying him and being hypocrites and yes I have seen a dead body my own sisters and it was traumatic but you guys don't know this person you really don't care you all just want to bully and that is what's wrong with this world!!! and it's so sad BUT  death is real and all over the world we have to deal with it he did nothing wrong you're  in the wrong for clicking on the video if you did not want to see it and now bullying HIM!!!! this world is sad wake up and focus on what's important in life take a look at your own actions before you judge his!! calling him names and cursing and also how many of you pay billions of dollars to go watch a movies of people getting murdered?!?! But yet he showed something in real life and that makes him bad!?! NO! but yet it's okay for all of you to attack him and Bully him some of you make no sense he did everything right as to blur the face and prepare everyone for what was in the video. and yet you all clicked on it and now you're mad what Hypocrites are you? and on all the shootings that have happened in the world I bet none of you have clicked on that yeah right this world is disgusting! you're all upset because he posted something that happened in his life and he loves his life every single day but yet you all attack him and click on all those videos of others dying around the world?! It makes no sense and this man that took his life probably was bullied himself and yet here you all are doing the same worldwide horrible epidemic that Logan Paul was trying to address! this is a sad world. sorry to the man that took his life only the Lord knows what he went through, and sorry to Logan Paul for being attacked and bullied for posting something that he experienced in his life and that is real life! and shame on all of you that are being bullies, that is all I see bullies and hypocrites. death is real and everyday so what did he do wrong, bullying and suicide is every day and what are you doing wrong right now?!
Him and his brother can both go to hell there so annoying
Hes on the news!!! 
Ok, where the hell was YouTube!!!
They remove videos for much less, unfortunately always conservative.
There are lots of people who tell other people to kill their self and they dont get in trouble but when Famoud pleople do it theres a problem
Logan is his own person he made a mistake but is a tiny 80 but tiny mistake the person kill himself because he wanted to Logan was going to go do an overnight challenge in the forest and he came across the body are you all getting mad at him so fuck everybody in the world that is criticizing him
Whoever watches this guy any way is a loser . Come on people you are making this guy rich.. he has probably never had a real hard working job before
This is getting ridiculous. Everyone is using Logans mistake for their own gain
There went his career in 2018. Kids watch him. He messed up big time. I unsubscribed.
I cant tell how mad I am about everyYoutube Group like this has a attention of Logan, i get it
The truth is he want views for money like his brother
Paul Brothers = SCUM!!
Viners are the scum of YouTube.
he messed up and said he was sorry multiple times and especially to the family. haters back off. it was disgusting but he owned up to it. move on people.
$400000* js
"Allegedly"
Like he said just a couple of dumb americans going camping in a suicide forest
WOAH WOAH WOAH, 
 yall do realize that there are more videos that have shown worse? 
Just because he is popular you automatically go 
"This is a problem, what about the kids, teens, and more." There is much more worse things on here then ever.
Found a d-dalla
He should goto jail
Jake Paul is an awful person. I've never liked him. He should be removed from YouTube.
I never thought I would see the day that I would think that Jake Paul is more competent and less arrogant than Logan Paul
Both of them are becoming more evolving autistic.
on the edge of nineteen I know right
Jake Paul wasn't there so we don't know that actually.
Chellotum okay, both the Pauls are shit
Chellotum doesn't matter Logan Paul did something worse STOP GIVING HIM EXCUSES
Oh! Come on! It was a mistakes... he is not perfect!
Everything Logan said is bullshit he's not raising awareness his apology is retarted the guy who killed himself RIP Logan can go kill himself and burn in hell fu Logan nobody believes in your apology.
I don't know why the f**k you tube dosent take your channel probably only 4 money but screw your money that is hurtful to everybody my sister's freind commited suicide and your just gonna make fun of the people that died yeah well next time your gonna upload a stupid video remember this jackass
If he is trying to stop suicide thats why theres is logic 1-800
He wanted to raise awareness for suicide but he laughed about it in his video
This was the opposite of suicide prevention or suicide awareness. As someone who suffers from depression this has a negative effect on me. I feel utterly disgusted from what I saw in that video.
rebecca lewis amen
Ryan Stotler Hi! I saw your comment.
I just want to let you know that I made a video about Logan Paul and this serious problem 
I hope you can join me, it is critical to know: be respectful to a person's death
Ryan Stotler he was just saying that it was to raise awareness to justify his stupidity.
Have you never seen someone so shocked that they start laughing, not knowing how to react?
Please get rid of this idiot. Him. And that pedophile RiceGum. And that guy Josh Paler Lin exploiting homeless guy. Team 10. All of them. SMH
*@LOGAN PUAL is human. no one is prefect. and the good news is he APOLOGIZED. so many haters may use that point to the negative side.lets be honest if he is self-fish he wouldn't get such huge success and yea he is truly good and honesty and he is king of YOUTUBE and he will be for ever.. logan4life*
Safana Bafana Ok dumbass think about it like this. Logan Paul and his cronies had to record the video of the dead guy, download the video of the dead guy, edit the video, make a thumbnail showing the body then publish. The publication of the video was deliberate not accidental. They had multiple opportunities to trash the project and make another video. They didnt. This is unacceptable. No normal human could do possible sit throughout the entire process and think yeah lets go ahead and show young kids the corpse of a man who killed himself. Get real kiddo
rebecca lewis At least you know Martinez is a rapist, glad we agree on that. Marilyn is a sex symbol? Wtf are you talking about. Nice try on roasting me, you get a good job sticker for that, darling
+Melanie Monroe OMG ur name is horrible first name of a rapist ( melanie martinez ) and ur last name of a sex symbol ( marylin monroe )
YESSSSSSS
-HOMINIX  I am DO not talking about how much money$ he making. *LOVE IS WORTH THAN MONEY* bro _u got me_ i thing u said something about learning.. i am just letting you know I Earned last semester *HIGH HONOR ROLL*  if u know what iam talking about unless get interpreter 
and thank you for you reply next time try it  *positively* 
by the way happy new year
Everyone hang on. .  Go look up a channel called TFIL. They went to suicide forest and they found the same thing. Wheres that on the news!
Its sad cause if you go to his comment section on his blog channel, all of his supporters are comforting him. Meanwhile other comment sections from other YouTubers are just bashing him over and over again. People need to chill cause with this much hate, Im afraid that the next body he will stumble upon will be his own.
He can not be forgiven at all that idiot this is a sin and not cool other people that go with family and friends and some of them did suicide
Wtf omg
WTF THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HIS MONEY
Even with Logan Paul in the video they couldn't break even 40k views ....poor mainstream media
Logan never should of shown the body and then laughed about it his ridiculous his disgusting
Im a person who believes in forgiveness but this is very much different because what he did is disrespectful and rude to the family of the person even if he took it of the internet it still has been seen thats why when u put stuff out there you can never take it of Im very disappointed in him and he should too.By the way I know he made a sorry video but thats not enough  ps.plz no hate my opinion
This guy just acts like hes coked up; hes not funny whatsoever.
honestly leave him the fuck alone
HE HAS 15MILLION FOLLOWERS ON YOUTUBE! XD XD XD have you ever heard of pewdiepie hahahaha
SHUT UP U ARE STUPID!!!!!!!!!
Came to dislike.. cuz you know ABC News did this also for views
Yah they reported this cause they know Logan is famous and they'll get more $$
Hahah Burn
Diaxide GT they also leftout many details that should have been added, but tbh it what they do
Diaxide GT or you know because theyre news and its their job to report things like this
Leon Achille exactly
I have a feeling Logan Paul knew the backlash will get him more views in the end, until of course YouTube demonetize everyone else except him or his brother.
He didn't mean to
maannnn fu.ck you abc news
He deleted the video
maannnn fuck you abc news shit fuck
maannnn fuck you abc news shit fuck
"Raise awareness" my ass
OH SHIT ABC COVERED IT OH SHIT SHOOK
I already saw the vid. And it is now down but I still remember it.
Why do we have to start 2018 like this?
You stupid
2018 is already done man
He sucks
He shouldnt have post this
I swear that guy is a sociopath
Please dont not post no more videos like this, Logan is trying to fix his mistake he doesnt need this hate.
Over 15 mil follower's actually it's 15 mil subscribers
Maddie and its followers not follower's
He was trying to promote suicide prevention? By telling people that if they commit suicide theyll be filmed and laughed at by stupid little kids?
In his apology he put I get views is he trying to show off or something he gets money from brainwashed 8 year olds who watch his shit
God, hes a douchebag and he KNOWS it. It was just incredibly disrespectful
Raised awareness? By doing what? Laughing at the dead body?
yep he was trying to dissuade people from committing suicide by telling them if they do he is going to come over and laugh at their body
These kids who agree with Logan's insensitive humor are growing irrational! I feel sorry for the next generation to come!
If Logan has a fucking brain he would have edited his laughing and the dead body out of the video. What a dumbass...
You people are all fucking retarded  you don't just film a dead body. you sick fucks are still defending.
Get over it, do something else with your loved people leave him alone #standwithlogan
1:44 bull shit he cant make a "positive ripple on the internet" hes making the internet worse Logan Paul fucking sucks.
What is wrong with him really?!
this guy is a fucking idiot
Logan do you know that people are going destroy you YouTube because is all on TV
I have no idea who the fuck this guy is, but the fact that stupid people defend him is beyond me. he's just a nobody with 13 year old ''fan girls'' whom based on comments have no clue about anything and what he did wrong.
IT WAS ON TH TRENDING PAGE AS NUMBER 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Biggest L of 2018
I can appreciate Logan saying sorry, He needed to say I'm sorry to his young fans, they didn't need to see that! To the people that were mad that he deleted the video, yes he needed to delete it, like I said the kids didn't need to see that! & he needed to apologize to the family of the suicide victim! So I can appreciate that, however... He needs to change a lot about his self. I mean this wasn't a little mistake,  From the time they found the victim he acted like a inconsiderate prick through the whole video, & even asked for subs at the end of the video so that means he had no remorse all day that day & all day the next day, But now he has Remorse now that he is getting flack! I'm not trying to run the guy into the ground but I mean This kinda shows you what kind of person he & the friends that were with him that day are! I'm just very disappointed in him! He is supposed to be a role model for our young generation! I sure hope they don't follow these actions.
Nobody hate Logan Paul please because he said sorry and sorry means some thing and dont say mean stuff about him and he does not care about the money or any thing so please dont hate Logan
Hey at least the dead guy got to meet a famous person tho so good job Logan
Fuck Logan paul
HOW WAS THAT VLOG ON TRENDING?!?
What. The. F*ck!
I didn't think the Pauls could hit a new low.
Next thing you know,he quits YouTube and we all miss him
Why are people defending him?
Its was a mistake come over it, seriously just stop it!!
He said he is sorry, so keep him alone
Malou Nielsen you are a little slow arent u
AstralRush he was laughin at that dead person u fuckin idiot kid
If an apology is all it takes, then I guess I can commit murder now.
AstralRush hahahaha keep on crying kid....I drink tears when Im thirsty..
His tweet is bull. You don't raise awareness showing the body multiple times and the poor mans hands. He tried to save himself, but unfortunately for him, we all see through his bs.
rebecca lewis Logan Paul cooked up a bullshit apology.
Jinxing Minx GOT EM
u have it all wrong logan said that suicide isn't ok and that mental illness are not jokes and he even out the suicide hotline in his description ur probably a 5 year old trying to make sense of the situation
Awareness by Laughing, smiling, and joking right next to a Suicide Victim. Yup "Awareness" reached 'Like if your sad bro'
Fuck off Paul.
HERE IS THE VIDEO HE DELETED................https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whLaRjHiJxI
HERE IS THE VIDEO HE DELETED................https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whLaRjHiJxI
See kids this is what happens when you become stupid on the internet. It will never leave. Thanks Logan for the start of 2018
Logans apology was probably written by his manager.
Owen Rezabek lol yup
Dino Rachael Go watch Minecraft let's plays
Stupid 12 year olds what do you know about him then
Dude you user is stupid 12 year olds which obvisly you are
$300,000 vehicle
Is it just me or did anyone else not find it bad that Logan posted the video
To say the least, this guy seriously has a lot of growing up to do smh
LMAO HE ENDED HIS CAREER
His parents raised him like an idiot.
This is disgusting... it makes me sad that our world has come to this...
FaZe Rug wont even show his dead hamster
That news anchor tho
He is full of shit.
Do have no words but disgust.
Adpocolypse part 2
He's my fav
that dead guy took the easy way out
Logan is Asom
I think YOUTUBE should End His Channel and BAN him from the website for Life!
What He Did was Disgusting, Disgraceful, and Absolutely Cruel on Just about Every Single Level.
OK I get it he got in trouble but I used to watch Aldo and one of his friends posted a video of him finding a dead body and Logan called the police, he still got in trouble but he reported it and apologized but the other guy didn't reported it and he also didn't apologize, so how did he didn't get in trouble but Logan did
ban that mofo from youtube
#Idubbbz I know who's getting a Content Cop next!
my 8 year old son  told me he seen this video  .. i am pissed . you tube needs to do something about this idiot...young kids look up to these  you tube people
lyandra lisaola ikr I hope they close his channel
That's why I'm glad there were (almost) no vloggers or money given away on Youtube when I was 8 at the time
I knew this ass clown would eventually fuck up.
He didnt make money from it
this kid is on the news?!
"Only 22"? That is a full grown adult. Can we please stop giving white men so many chances after doing despicable things?
Everyone is so triggered
How you go to a suicided forest and not find a dead body . So he did this on purpose just for money that's gone to far
OH YAY MY NAME IS LOGAN PAUL ONLY THING A CARE ABOUT IS VIEWS AND MONEY prick.
Ya he was laughing like y
my kids say they like to "hate watch him"  LOL fucking awesome
It's awful to see people in the comment section who still support that dumpster fire of a person. He was so disrespectful to the body. Logan should have shut off cameras immediately and called the authorities.
Xxdoge21 hbu
Tsuvani excuse me i have more matureness then my 48yr stepdad do you think im not able to judge myself and others
hermon demsas 1. Im not your dude im a girl
2. You obvisly cant read so hbu really read it
Teily Wathen ....youre too young to even judge yourself and others
Ikr he should have been arrested, police impersonation, disturbing the peace, etc. Already.
It will go away in like a few day....tbh I think what he did was disrespectful but thats how people are.
Exposed
Why does YouTube has to suffer
It is truly disgusting to know human beings like him live on this earth . Logan Paul is disgusting laughing when seeing the poor man . He used that poor man for views its sickening .
ikr also he created a huge problem regarding relations between the locals and foreigners. This makes people in japan feel more uncomfortable towards people coming into japan
K9 Just the same as white people still being fucking racist and acting like their not
there is nothing about his video to show any type of awareness on suicide.He was even standing less then 5 foot away filming a dead body.He should have turned off his gear when they first noticed the person hanging.He wanted the views and the money for posting that video period.
it's how he deals with things like that, with humor
He makes mistakes jeez... u all guys in the comments are so weak and butthurt HE SAID FKN SORRY
https://youtu.be/PyihHuINXC4
Who came from Eh bee family?
LEAVE LOGAN
This was an unnecessary topic
All of these youtubers are getting content off of a 22 year olds mistake. I make a lot of mistakes every day and I dont get judged for it, but he makes one mistake and it will stick with him for a lifetime! Imagine if you were in his shoes, what would you do? We all make mistakes, so lets stop being babies and let it go. Why are all of the youtubers being pathetic and getting content off of it, how about you go get content instead of talking bad about other people.
let me just say its not he planned to see a dead body
Crimson Tide But he shouldn't film it
nuff said
CANCER ! fucking CANCER ! fuck these arseholes like him
Embrace the adpocalypse!
How dare you! You disgust me. I can't believe that so many young people look up to you. So sad. Hopefully this latest video woke them up. You are pure trash. Plain and simple. Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell. -AARON PAUL
HE   MADE  A   MISTAKE     EVERY    BODY    DOES   HE    SAID    SORRY    ,   PLEASE    STOP
growing up experience what he's an adult that's like saying i raped a girl because i was drunk and his apology is weak it was all about him.
I watched before it was deleted and the body is still pictured in the back of my mind. It was disturbing even for a teen so image like a 8-9 year old. Crazy.
Stephen Bowen i didnt see the video because you took the phone 
He should be fired you shouldnt be seeing stuff like that your only 11
Stephen Bowen  
Don't want him to get fired from youtube 
EmilieTGM The golden minecart hello emilie b
I watched it and I am 29 years old. It was still disturbing. No kids should be looking at stuff like that. It can really mess you up at that age.
Just last week i was dying. Wait- thats not- I was sick! He says this while laughing. How is anyone still offending this piece of trash?
Check mine out on my channel
who fucking cares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this makes GMA? fuck off
ABC  you don't have any news to broadcast again. This is not a news, talk about what is happening in Chicago talk about genetically modified food that America is producing.
He apologized ok he made a mistake everyone makes a mistake 
A b c d e f g somone shud have told you never to fuck with me
Does anyone get annoyed when they said he has 15 followers on YouTube I surely did
ABC news I love your company but give long an Paul his YouTube
....... I have no idea what to say....
Raise awareness? Positive? How dare you even put that in your make believe apology typed letter. @Jakepaul And the fact that you were laughing about it is even more sickening to even watch. You should be a shamed of yourself. I suffer with depression, severe major depression its nothing to make fun about and definitely not a joke to video tape a man that had suffer and did that to him self. You know exactly where you were going. They have plenty of signs at the park and its well known. And your title was out of this world disgusting for the video. So dont you dare say raise awareness because you werent even close. SHAME ON YOU! Oh also lets not beat around the bush its all about money always was. I just hope for this young generation does not follow your footsteps and they should open up their eyes after this. This is disgusting. Im literally crying.
Please give Logan Paul his YouTube channel back
I wouldnt have cut the camera either but I would have called 911 and ran
You guys are ass holes go fuck your self he apologized so get off his ass you guys can go to he'll
This is the part of the video the media took out -.- please know the truth before you judge https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/logan-paul-youtube-video-latest-dead-body-suicide-apology-career-over-social-media-stars-money-rich-a8138716.html%3Famp
Logan even got frustrated in the video cause kids were running around and might see the body.
I subscribed to Logan Paul. Should i unsubscribe to him or is it okay???
You left out the most important part. He was laughing about it.
Nature's Dildo he turns bad things to comedy cause thats his thing he also is doing that because he doesnt want us to feel completely scared
No wasn't
U ARE A DILDO HE IS A GOOD KID
Phycologists call it a nervous laughter you stupid fucker
Nature's Dildo Like its the first time someone has committed suicide
fuck this ass clown
If i catch him in Chicago, Ima shoot him
You made a huge mistake !!
AstralRush I looked at ur channel lmao 
AstralRush i looked at your channel and all i see is literally a little child that doesnt know shit about what is goin on he is a grown man who recorded this poor soul for views he deserve this
Would you idiots shut up? We have this YouTuber who films a dead person who had committed suicide, laughing at it. Stop justifying it.
Chill everyone makes mistakes. Do not reply cuz i ain't comin back.
WTH IS A WRONG WITH YOUUUUUU LOGAN PAUL.
I use to love his YouTube channel
Uhhhhhhhhh I'm done with him
He is so stupid
Him and his brother are cancer. They are some of the scummiest guys on YouTube!!!
The only reason people defend him is because he's "hot". If he was ugly, no one would defend him. Such a disturbed world we live. Luckily I'm better than most idiots, which makes me stronger.
Anyone who doesnt normally watch YouTube dont judge the community by people like this the rest of the community hates him this is the bad part of YouTube thats always frowned open by everyone else
ugh he's disgusting
Hoefully this isn't a sign of what's to come in 2018.
Shut the fuck dude he had no clue how to respond, he vlogged it because he wanted people to know about suicide. He had no clue that he would see that. So learn your facts before you say shit .
Omg logan paul is on abc news damm
Do fucking disrispecting, hope karma and some ghosts haunts him
FOLLOWERS its a news channel get it right its SUBSCRIBERS
Adout
i shouldve watched the fucking video
watched it on Logan's channel now it's gone YouTube deleted it then brought me here
Stop talking adroit it we are not make it any better
A POSITIVE RIPPLE MY ASS
What is the problem with that
Everyone One And This Channel If Your Not A Jake Pauler Or If Your Not In The Logang Like Abc News Well FUCK YOU THEY ARE JUST 20 And 22 They ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR YOUNG LIVES FUCK WHO ISNT IN THE LOGANG PAULERS
Logan paul is idiot
He said sorry
IT WAS ON THE NEWS!! WTFFFFFFFFT
Everyone is picking this up
what do you expect that's his job and if you finished watching the video he was talking about how you can get help you cant criticize him for it
So raise awareness for suicide? Even after laughing and making jokes about that poor soul? He didn't need to record it he could of turn off the camera , call the police and leave at that and he could gone back to record other parts of the forest but noooo seeing it was his opportunity to make an uproar and get likes since the social media is so cancerous , what he did is disrespectful to the person who took away his life and to his family....
Shut up Logan Paul is messed up ok so shut your mouth shite ass
Shut up
Melvin Harris typical fancvnt , would you like it if a complete stranger found your loved one who just killed themselves and made jokes or laugh bc they were nervous? You don't see the point it was disrespectful to even upload it , the person who they found dead was disrespected by Logan and his minions , and yet he still disrespected the family of his and to know he said it was about suicide awareness is complete bs and we all know it....his followers are basically kids you imbecile they shouldn't be expose to that kind of crap...now stop being a fancvnt
Danna Rosas but this isn't a horror movie , this is real life, would you like it if someone find a love one of yours and they laugh and made jokes ?
this made me cry he apologized and its ok to make mistakes...
Fuck you abc news I dont like Logan that much but all yall do Is report drama
This dude is fucking cancer, I do not think he was trying to raise awareness for suicide he just wants views. I wonder what Idubbz would have to say about this?!
Logan paul dont worried we forgive u i know it mistake no one perfect tho we love ya rememeber always be logang be a maverick <3
We want to see the body 
Ppl shut up
The Paul Brothers stay alive through drama
JUST GIVE LOGAN SLAKE YOUR MAKING me Cry poor Logan He Must Feel Horrible Everyone Just Shut The F*** Up He's Just 22 He Made A Mistake We are Not All Perfect We Make Mistakes Well Apparently BIG CELEBRITY BITCHES DONT well they Do Give The Paul's So Slake Please And If A Celebrity Like Justin Beiber Or Pewdiepie Um And Celebrities from Disney Or Nickoldeon And Normal People Who Arnt Backing Up The Paul Brothers Well FUCK YOU
Its not for children its for teens
HelloCompanion Id even describe Logan as a kid...
Lol, same thing. Teenagers are basically children in most peoples eyes.
First of all, that doesn't make it better. Second, according to his demographics it is people that are 8-15 on average that watch his videos. So yea, his channel is mostly watched by kids.
What they don't understand about why we make fun of him in general. Is that hes an obnoxious blowhard. And doesn't belong here.
OMG GET OFF HIM HE IS SORRY
I honestly thought he was better than jake and I liked him for that reason but they are both the same. Logan is probably worse than jake. 6 million views on that video where all of them were maybe kids. he couldnt just stop recording and went and got help? he just gets close to the body and records it like is there any respect.
*im not trying to be rude* ok like geeees don't call people an idiot like they always say treat others the way you wanna be treated OK we get it you don't have to be mean to Logan Paul deleted the video everybody calm down it's just a video but he took it off by the way no hate please this is my opinion so you don't have to go all baddie baddie
AllisonT501 Dancergirl Just because that it is your opinion doesn't mean that you can't be judged
Imagine if a person rapes someone then gets backlash then he or she makes an apology video
What would you feel?
THIS VIDEO IS RETARED CUZ ALL OF THEM KNOW NO SHIT
I feel so bad for him...
1978: maybe in the future humans will have advanced technology and use it for good
2018:
Viners have ruined youtube
Daammnn!!!
I love Logan Paul
Omg I feel so bad for Logan he freaked out and now he's scared he could be guilty
Wait it's his fault someone hanged themselves in the forest? Tf
Just leave Logan Paul loan its not his fault that hes recording is it its stupid that hes getting arranged it doesnt really matter because its not his fault that he found the body its not his fault that the parties that everyone should just leave Logan Paul alone
SlimeMaker That loves cats Yet he made fun of the dead person which is a really bad thing 
Seriously, you are a fucking idiot
Yo it not realy not that big deal bro but I get that suiside is a big deal but realy bro
What an awful human.
Check my snap
I don't think logan meant to but i saw that video and it was sad
YouTube should be taken down period! And stop making these idiots famous
joel tapia bitch stop
joel tapia Orrrrr they can just bann these channels like Jake's channel too
joel tapia says the one whose on youtube
joel tapia No one can take down YouTube bruh its a very very big company worth billions
He should of never posted it ever in the first place. If you wanted to adress suicide you do not post a video of someone who just hung themselfs...also you do not laugh about it
Bruh the news is retarded calls subscribers followers
This is what people wanna get all up in arms for.  Compared to whats on regular tv everyday.  Really!! Get a hobby people, really.
Mind your own buisness*
AvGeek Well sometimes someone has to stand up. And that someone is me. I don't mean to be mean but if Aaron Paul is going to do that then I'm on Logans side. And I mean come on, I'm a loganger, loganger always have Logans side so how about you just stop and mud your own buisness!!!
My daughters wanted me to buy them Logan Paul merch. Hahaha!! NEVER! Id never support him!!
Ok Logan that person took his life because of the torment and suffering that he went through. Think about his family and the sorrow they are going through. Show respect for his soul it was not appropriate to show his body on your video.
I COMPLETELY understand why people were outraged and got angry at both him and the video. It was kind of hypocritical for people to call him names and to tell him to rot in hell. Theyre just adding more drama and attracting more negative attention to what he did. If someone did something bad why would you harass and call them names when youre not only adding drama but bullying them as well?
Laka Sude What do you expect though?
Logan and his brother Jake are materialistic pieces of shit.
people and thats the guy youtube have it on the youtube rewind 2017, this really tell us that youtube is pretty FUCK UP, fuck you Logan
Just to be honest it was a mistake and everyone makes mistakes 
Fuck this guy
Even So, his apology was VERY WEAK and you can clearly tell he wasn't trying to "raise awareness".
It's Sad because logan cared more about himself while writing that apology and he knows that. People like Aaron Paul have the right to call him out for such disgusting behavior and because of that he should have his fame taken from him.
And in the end everyone (even logan) knows that filming this dead body will help him profit. It wasn't for awareness or prevention he was just in it for the money
I loved his videos but now idk anymore wtf i'm so offended!
he took the time to video this then edit it and not in all that time it would have taken did he really not take a second to understand how fucking disgusting it was to do this. He is pure scum. Only cares for money.
I still like him 
Who is aron Paul?
Nikilmista too lazy
google it
So disrespectful
IDIOT the fucken pauls
He posted a video saying so sorry
And its not like he didnt blur out the face he only showed the purple hands
O lord.
Stop talking crap about Logan he was just trying to tell people if thinking about that then go to a doctor he even showed that in that vlog
Pooh Bear wow this little kid thinking he's strong on the internet and even if he's a grown man its still not right to laugh at the body and record the body
Miranda Jenks cool he took down the video that doesn't matter, many kids still saw the video and people. Reuploaded it
Nikilmista people like you should be banned from the internet - Im in the Logang and I am supporting him - all Im trying to say is he knows hes done wrong - he took the vid down and apologized - you act like they showed his faces and touched him  but no he blurred it out and only showed the hands
Far online Gamers bitch shut the fuck up dude he is a grown ass man
You think laughing at the body and recording the  body okay? He's disrespectful like his cancerous fans
Well, he got attention
Logan Paul:
>demonetized video since he knew it would contain sensitive topics
>wants to go camping in a haunted forest for the luls
>heard about suicide stories but meh that's just a legend
>goes inside forest with mates
>discovers dead body
>obviously freaked out
>blurs out man's face to protect identity
>subsequently gives speech on why suicide is never the answer
>is only laughing because in shock
>calls police
>helped to find a man that killed himself who's been missing for God knows how long
>still in shock
>cuts to the end of the video and gives another speech on why suicide is never an answer
>gets so much hate and contoversy that he is forced to remove the video
>called out by dozens of big YouTubers
>reputation ruined
Everybody needs to chill out about this situation. It's blown way out of proportion.
ok but the video was about suicide prevention and how to get help that was shown to 15 million people is that a bad thing? and to kids our next generation and also our current generation suicide has popped up by 33% we need the message out
Ain't a legend, it's literally called Suicide Forest where people end themselves, so our precious Logan went there in search for his vlog-material.
Demonetization only affects his income, nothing else.
Dude has 15 million subscribers, most of which are little kids, yet he still shows them a deceased body (sure something i'd want my kids to see).
He deserves the hate, man
i have forgiven him because people misunderstude the reason he has went into the forest he wants to tell people that they should not do that and hater need to back of because knowing reality today none of you would have put down the camrea
Trap just ignore him, he won't get any sense into that thick skull of his.
AstralRush hahaha you crying loganger......
I would like to think that most people would have the common sense not to go off the trail in a FUCKING SUICIDE FOREST in the first fucking place. What the fuck do you think he expected to find huh? A mystical land of fucking make-believe? Aokigahara is called the suicide forest for a fucking reason. You stupid fucking nitwits keep defending the indefensible and it is seriously ruining my faith in fucking humanity right now.
he was after clicks, astral, dont be naive
The yeti actually cost $300,000
All the kids that watch his content will now be traumatized and will end up needing some type of counseling
Me: *not listening to anything*
Also me: "Did they just say *FOLLOWERS* on YouTube?"
y'all forgot to mention...he blurred the face
What a fucking idiot
Welp. Great job everyone. Letting something like this happen. Whats next?.
Just leave him alone he said sorry 
Everybody makes mistakes
This is so sad. These parents don't even know who their even watching. Smh.
Fuck Logan pauls bitch ass
The Paul brothers can truly go fuck themselves up their own assholes to death.
It's not about YOU, Logan Paul. A man who had family and friends chose to end his life, and you chose to share his death to your millions of followers without thinking about how his family/friends felt? It's disgusting and shouldn't be tolerated. IF U MISSED VIDEO CHECK ON MY CHANNEL . FULL LENGTH VIDEO ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED !
Ayyyy I saw the vid
He still alive he posted a new video
Stfu new bitches.....plz leave him alone
Logan said sorry
Logan Paul died the cops looking for the person who killed him.
this is so messed up. how can people still support him? one apology doesnt change what he did. he is already an adult and can think with logic. w t f.
0:21 you mean in America *
Logan Paul dont deserve his fame just like the kardashians.
Ohh he didnt it for views 
Thus guy is ling!! He gets money for showing a dead body!! That is so horrible, i wish his youtube channale would have been deleted!!!
Shut up he is Better then all of you.he tuke it Down so stop talking about it #logang4life
Well he got fired good for him but McDonalds are hiring right now
Screw all of youuuuuu and there not 15 millon FOLLERS its SUBSCRIBERS
Raising awareness would be witnessing... deleting any footage of the actual event and sitting down and talking one on one with the camera, telling his viewers about suicide prevention. SO.... not at all what he was trying to do. The fact that his fan base are so blind just gives you a little glimpse of the future of Americas youth. 
He is 22.... he is not even a dumb teenager anymore.
It honestly made me sick watching it.
Did u watch the actual Logan Paul video that he posted and took down?
I intended to prevent suicides and raise awareness. 
Logan Im surely showing people a DEAD CORPSE will fucking help with that.
Fuck off Logan Paul and fuck off youtube
Unacceptable!!I hope the parents of that suicide boy pay Logan a visit to get a REALITY CHECK!!
I hate these people there making me think Logan is a dumb youtuber
You are joking right? Eh put the mans blurred body into the thumbnail to get more clicks
He was not click baiting he is the best person ever
He filmed a dead persons body, click baiting it for the views. He is more than dumb, he is brain dead and so are you.
allegedly
Logan apologized to the victim and his family... how could he apologize to the victim if hes already dead?
So fucking what big fucking deal he showed a video of someone who hung them self this is what pisses me off completely all you haters wanna cry and complain about a dead body but its ok for your kids to learn that sex is ok or what stupid tv shows of people hurting them selves or drugs or crime like what do you think you are promoting that its ok for that stuff everybody has a bad day everybody fucks up in life thats what life is and your just a pussy or a bitch for talking shit about someone behind there back through a damn computer or screen or a phone so your just as worthless his videos make me laugh yes it was a serious video I get that but its more serious when you belittle someone behind a keyboard do you realize thats a leading cause of suicide its called cyber bullying get a fucking life you ungreatful degenerates
I feel bad 4 Logan
"15M followers on youtube' Omg
He laughed at the dead body! -_- he knows exactly what he was doing.
I want to see this 
Anyone know where i can find this vidoe
Shut the fuck up leave long paul
He's a disgusting piece of shit. He even made jokes about it on the spot. This fucker should've been swallowed.
#MAVERICK4LIFE
Everybody stop exaggerating he just showed a dead guy
ABC NEWS just leave Logan alone
Selena Garza ok but that doesn't mean he should be hated
Alessandra Lopez you need to grow up & undertstand what Logan did was really wrong!!
Imagine all the parents that watched there children watch this
F U C K L O G A N P A U L H E I S A C U N T
LOGAN IS THE BEST I HOPE YOU DIE IN THE PITS OF HELL ABNC NEWS DIE GO SUBSCRIBE TO ME
Ok Logan stfu we all know that was clickbait it's just that your 8 year old fans will always be on your side
AstralRush My intention is not to attack you- I would like to put this situation in a different perspective for you. The reason there is so much hate isn't because we're all "sensitive pussies". Where was the respect for the person who just died, their family, and the culture of Japan? Where was the conscience of Logan when his group came across the body? Any respectful person would have turned off the cameras or edited the footage out at least. It's not an accident that this footage made it through the editing process. Any person editing would have to review the footage first.  If his pure intention was to raise awareness of suicide, he should've said something sympathetic instead of going over to the body and getting a close up of this person. His actions proved that he most likely wanted views or publicity. I know somewhere in the video he said that something like this has never been done on Youtube  and there is a reason it's that way. It is completely against Youtube guidelines to show what Logan did in that video. A lot of people hate that Logan is not getting punished while others do minor infractions compared to this one.
Edit: I forgot to include what I meant about respecting the culture of Japan. In Japan, they treat the dead with utmost respect.
Instagram Daily lit yeah because that's sooo relevant.
Clickbait Master 11 says the guy with the fucked up profile picture
Clickbait Master 11 I am sorry you mean his 15 million subscribers oh wow sorry for liking a dude literally no ones perfect. Everybody makes mistakes and we may not know what to do or react to them. His fan base is a variety of ages you can see in multiple videos there are children, teens and parents who like him so stfu
AstralRush You're actually a fucking idiot if you think he did this to raise awareness rather than try to use that as a cover up to this bullshit.
White Boys acting a mess. Is this the one who got the chance to be on Disney channel?
And I bet none of you watched the video and your just on the team
"only 22" hes a grown ass man he knows what he did was wrong and for views
but he lost subs, because of your news.
ABC NEWS YOU ARE DUMB YOU ARE DOING IT FOR THE VIEWS
ABC just standing in the blood are we?
Logan Paul just made a mistake but he also he confessed and apologize, so I think that's a great gift from God for some people's...
You all are idiots
I saw that original vlog before he took it down
And you guy are cuting parts of the video but he sees that he tries to help peppol out so they won't have as menny problums
Ohhhh the hypocrisy of the news
https://youtu.be/uHLHubGiRbA
THIS IS ALL OVER THE WEB!!! OH MY GOD, HOW DUMB IS LOGAN?
CBS news get over because he already apologized and he even erased the video off his channel
Stfu bitches u pay attention to the bad he does so fuck u guys fuck u!!!
That rude and be niccccccce
I will never hate Logan. I dont care what you all think, I wont ever hate him. 
Ill probably have some 8-11 year olds coming at me now oof
What a cunt.
He's always been shit what are you talking about
But he toke it way too fuckin far
You guys need to stop because I have watched that video more than one time
still better than Jake Paul
Idc that the guy died big whoop
A psychopath is someone who doesn't feel emotion. You sir seem to fit the bill perfectly
Now can we take the Paul brothers off youtube??????
he said it as his fucking mistake
shut up he just posted the vid that he was fucking sorry
bitch
Subs. Get ur shit straight
everyone makes mistakes dont come and yell at them
He's sorry so shut the fuck up
CANCEROUS PAULS ON YOUTUBE
i bet the people trying to make fun of this guy are the 10 year olds who watch that blonde fuckwits content
RUB MY ASS BISH
Nice, LOL.
SWAGgangstermcman EECKS DEE XD ur mom
I dont want my parents to watch this. lol
This guy is an idiot with a channel for idiots nothing more. He's what you tube was always meant to be.
The only prevention here is dont commit suicide or Logan Paul will laugh at your dead body and use it to benefit his career.
"He has 15 million followers on youtube," BAHHAHAHAHHAHA ITS CALLED SUBSCRIBERS
Screw Logan Paul! He is SCUM!
Do your fucked Logan Paul
LOGANG WHERE YOU AT
absolute scumbag. this is what happens when we get so overloaded on entertainment - we get the situations in which people go way too fucking far in the name of it. i haven't seen the video so i don't know this for sure, but it sounds like his reaction to seeing the body of someone who killed themselves wasn't sadness or fear or horror, but excitement at the prospect of having a shocking title, thumbnail, and video content that no one has had before. our culture's obsession with entertainment, fame, money, etc. is poisonous. fucking evil
your voice is soooooo monotone
What a loser
Honestly, who gives a fuck. Look at our president. Really dont care how anyone acts anymore, just going to do me. 
You guys look YouTube is a platform for over 18 and now it's for over 4 I don't get this
OJHHHH SHEET LOGAN I. TROUBLE!!!
THE LOGANG MUST BE STOPPED!!
pamela mendoza It will be stopped, everyone KNOWS about this lunatic
come_on_daisy XD Um...have u seen what Logan did, I hope many people sue him, and I think his channel might be taken down, so THE LOGANG MUST BE STOPPED
WILL HOLYGONS no you should be stop
stop posting all this stupid shit you all are makeing him feel bad even knkw he only did it to raise awareness
THIS IS NOT NEWS....
Logan Paul you fucking dumbass
Thats what he wants be on the news and get more famous like if you think the same
why tf would you laugh at a dead body and call it entertainment
Well yeah it its history because other people arent dumb enough like him
He sucks
I didnt do it for views. He had the dead body as the thumbnail for clickbate. Smh dude.
Unsubscribe logan
wow, he might even be more hated and disrespected than Donald Trump now...
He was scared he did not know what to do
lol another reason to hate Jake Paul
How insane do you have to be to do something like this?
"Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell." I don't support what Logan did, but that is so freaking ironic and stupid.
Im done with him im leaving him in 2017 just how I did with Jake when I found out how bad he was
What he did was completely wrong. Suicide is not a joking matter. There are people out there who are really suffering from mental health. It is a shame that he will go to that extent for views. Then again he is only 22, We all did stupid things at 22. His just happened to be in the public eyes. This should be a wake up call for him ( maturity wise).
You guys are idiots, he did not mean to offend anyone. He is a vlogger 80% of his life is on camera. Im not saying his actions were right because they are not, JUST STOP THE HATE. He is a great person. LOGANG4LIFE.
Abc news y'all are dumb he's really nice he just made some bad mistakes but we all do right
DAMN IT LOGAN 
WELL HELLO LOGAN I BET LOTSSSS OF YOUTUBERS HAVE SEEN A DEAD BODY IN THE FOREST AND DIDNT POST IT LIKE U DID
I forgive him he stumbled into something unspeakable yes he handled it the wrong way but he didn't mean the trouble
Honestly he made a mistake and we all make mistake
Wolfqueen Playz yes, but normally we dont make mistakes consciously.
This is a learning experience!!!!? I think it's pretty fucking clean you don't do this in the first place
Ya sure he tried to help. If he did then why was he joking around.
Bad start for Logan in 2018
So if Logan is in hot water does that mean that while everyone pissed at him he's just chilling in a hot tub??
Gilberto Paz yeah, metaphorically you could say hes chilling in a hot tub all by himself because he shit his pants in it.
logan paul is such trash....
YO HES FUCKED ITS ON FUCKING ABC NEWS
logan is still my fav youtuder and that was a good video that he made bc he say if you want to kill your self then he there for you or any one this is makeing me mad that not right if any of you people see a deadbody you will post it many of people post a dead body on there youtude and they are not getting no hate like they are
THIS SHIT ON THE NEWS
Half of you idiots didn't even watch the vlog. When he posted it, i agree i thought it was a bit much. But they notified authorities, directed the rescue personel to the body. And blurred out the man's face. He also mentioned how there was no way he was going to monetize the video. He started the video with a graphic content warning, he spent several minutes of the vlog reinforcing the narrative that depression should be taken seriously and if anyone viewing the video is feeling depressed or suicidal they need to seek help immediately. 
Im not sure what else he could've done to take a better approach to the situation, BESIDES not posting that poriton of the video which i think we can all agree he shouldn't have done. Stop acting like made this unforgiveable mistake. He's 22, he made a judgement call that wasn't great.
+Boshwa That wouldn't be quite the same as what Logan Paul did because you just asked for permission. Technically, even a request like that is more morally acceptable (while still being wrong) than what he did.
but he cared too much about the video that he literally edited the whole vlog, made the thumbnail of a dead person, and left it on youtube (for a few) expecting everyone to take his side, in my opinion he's just using that suicide victim for views.. & now he wants everyone to be sorry for him
Did you know someone who committed suicide?
If so, can I record them and laugh at their face so I can upload it to youtube?
I saw the vlog, but I think he should have entirely cut the part with the body out
Cory Shrewsbury you're just as pathetic as he is for defending this low life scum. I'd spit on his ugly butterface and light a match and throw it at his hay stack he calls hair.
LoganPaul is cool
he had plenty of time to not post but he EDITED TITLED and POSTED. 
what a dumbass.
Celebs telling him that suicide isnt a joke, and then they tell him to kill himself... Im done
You guys care more about this than other stuff happening...pathetic
Guys I got a photo of this his head is blurred
God damm i wanna see the vid
Hahahaha "you can't end your career bro you too lit"
Jp- hold my beer (2 days into 2018) 
Maybe 2019 will be your year
He apologized everyone
he is the best youtuber ever i love him he is the best and he posted a video today apologizing for his mistake
I honestly don't see the problem. After watching that vlog I didn't see anything wrong and I am surprised that he was put in a position where he felt like he needed to say sorry. He didn't make any mistake. And now I have to watch this short azz video that probably wouldn't have been made if some people weren't so sensitive. We all watch his vlogs and know he cares about people so you people saying y'all are disappointed don't know how you would have reacted in that same situation. Even though he knew what that place was, he probably didn't expect to actually see a dead body, therefore he was probably shocked. There is a such thing as laughing but not actually funny laughing and you people know it. People who watch his vlogs remember how sad he was when his friends puppy died... ok so chill out and enjoy the vlogs. Logan you did nothing wrong bro! Happy New Year!

He disgusts me
This is beyond disrespectful and just plain rude. As a mentally ill person I know how it feels. Logan is a terrible himan being for filming  a person who truly believed they were worthless enough to take their own life. He is a despicable person. His apology is not an actual apology. It's and excuse to save his rear. And no freaking duh you're going to find a dead body in a suicide forest. He shouldn't have even got in there in the first place.
It is just disgusting how he exploited a dead body to gain views. It is purely disgusting.
he didn't do it for views
PPLLLL STOP USING HIS NAME HE GOT THE IDEA AND HE APOLIGIZED THIS IS SO ANNOYING!!!!!!!
I WAS ON TV 
I don't like how they call Logan out for the things he buys it just makes kinda mad
sophie turner should turn the fuck off because logan paul is more popular then hi,
Yo-yo I I know I am gonna get a lot of hate because of this Logan4life
AstralRush "Pussies" Yeah. Because it's not at all fucking insensitive to film a victim of suicide.
Tomas ESCOBAR CARCAMO why would you still support Logan after what he did? He had hours to Edit the video of the body out, and him making jokes while laughing. So that was no mistake. He did this all for VIEWS!!!
Edit: btw AstralRush just stop!!!
Trap k
AstralRush yep
AstralRush Because the mistake is unforgivable. Very disrespectful. Very corrupt. Would you want your corpse to be filmed on? Since youre a loganger, maybe youll like being filmed because its lit. Just reevaluate yalls minds kids. Yalls parents need to teach you more about life.
There are already existing documentaries on the suicide forest and other things that raise awareness on suicide in general without him adding to it. Let's be honest, this guy did it (solely) for views because YouTubers like him get paid for views.
is so ugly
Poor logan he was trying to get a bright thing out and all he gets is hate
Is it bad that some animals make me hard
To all those with PTSD.....
Why the fuck did you click the video in the first place, you all seem to be grown adults, all seem to have reason, all seem to kick him in the crotch, all seem to send him to jail, skin him alive, make him a slave.....
My question is, why the fuck did you even watch that video when it had warnings!?
Both the Creator and the viewers are wrong in this scenario
This is why I hate Logan Paul. He does stupid things!
It's not a big deal damn
GET HIM GET HIM
Fucking ABC will do anything to spread gosp
Starting 2018 right!
Fuck you I love Logan Paul
Only for you a login form is apologizing your making a big mistake please do not do this BBC news of f****** something please the Logan Paul is so nice to be A Maverick will make sure I will send this to login the login for life
sounds about white I mean right
He intended to make awareness for suicide by making a mockery of it? Oh okay. 
If he really feels bad he'll give us some money for having to see his dumbas face all over the news and internet.
Wtf. Im 22, I wanna know how old you have to be to learn that footage of random dead people have no place a vlog channel, especially one aimed at children. This isnt a learning experience he got the attention he needed and because YT wont do anything about it, his numbers will spring back up in a month or so. Now he has a nasty tweet from Aaron Paul under his belt thatll only help further his career. This was all carefully thought out. Plain and simple.
U K eh. Ive got family that grew up in impoverish war zones. You have no idea what images of dead bodies can do to kids. If you really think that protecting your kids from stuff like this makes them SJW pussies then for the love of *god* do not have children.
Also, I fail to see how this is social. Its just common self respect
+Evan Devin Just like SJWs people here need to chill a bit lol Dont know who is worse. His 'brain dead' fan base as you call them or the people who are loosing their shit over nothing acting like they are some moral compass lol Miss me with that gay moral compass shit
Michael Schemmel "It's a dead body get over it" tell that to Japan. You understand how disrespectful that is over there? It's entirely disrespectful to even take pictures of people without consent too. That's even common sense here. It's more than just a dead body. It's this jackass fucking it up for anyone who wants to travel at all , any white men or women working over seas. We're already despied enough as it is. They might as well just have a fucking blood bath over here. It's disgustingly visable that a huge percentage of Americans are entirely incapable of learning respect.
U K SJW? how's that have to relate to anything, the only ppl who actually like him are his brain dead fan base
He needs to be kicked off YouTube he is disgusting who does something like that and he says it was a mistake thats bullshit he dosent mean that at all
Damn.. even sophie came over here? Holy shit paul you done fucked up.
Boycott Pepsi and all others that endorse this idiot! Raise suicide awareness, yeah right.
You can't say he did it for the money, because he says at the beginning of the video that didn't monetize the video.
Logan isn't a child he's a 20 something year old who knows wtf he's doing
FUCK THIS CHANNEL 
Stupid and senseless brat! Shame on him!
It makes me so sad for Logan, I mean yes HE FOR SUUUUUURE made a MAJOR mistake. But people take him wrong as the video had said. And yes he should have not showed the man to begin with but I mean if you think about it all this hate causes people to make those decisions. -cough- suicide
Lmao you cant keep apologizing for every mistake you make idiot. Fix your dumbass and use the money to put it to good cause, not for your own good
You know leave him alone
What a douche...
His apology is bullshit. He went into the forest KNOWN for scuicides, It's in the fucking TITLE of the name of the forest, there's WARNING SIGNS before you go in, and then he chose to Film, Edit, and Upload.
The Paul brothers are a terrible influence on their target demographic. They are teaching young impressionable teenage girls to fall for those with toxic, manipulative, emotionally abusive personalities like theirs.
 I get views lol wat a tool
Hey hey, no, it's not called followers, it's subscribers
Still interesting vid
Are you kidding hes still getting subscribers!! What is wrong with this world
I'm so glad I don't or ever watch him
Hey!!! Logan is my hero and he is the best family I have ever had. Even my family is trashy to me. But Logan and the Logang are always there for me. Logan Paul is not trash. If a 9 year old like me can see the good in him but you can't that's just sad
At least it wasn't clickbait 
U piece of shit! Who gives a damn about clickbait. We r talking about suicide
rebecca lewis yeah he didn't do it for views he did it for money
+odd boi he didn't do it for views
It was clickbait because it attracted people so his clickbait
clickbait
klikbt/Submit
nouninformal
(on the Internet) content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular web page.
yea its fucking clickbait
Tbh i dont care if it's disrespectful to view a dead body. After all they wanted to suicide by themselfs. Its really funny how one person dies due too suicide everyone in the world feels bad. It was his choice to suicide. I would have sone it for views after all.
This mans channel should have been taken down *LONG* before this drama happened...
This is the reason the US is a joke to the rest of the world now. Its not the kids complaining, its the new generation of bitches that run this country. Children are busy getting pleasure of killing others while playing games like Call on Duty, watching movies and TV shows where murder, sex and drugs run rampid, but show the blurred body of a dead person, everyone flips out. Breaking bad star was offended? How ironic when every household knows his stupid show but I bet he has no issue with that does he. North Korea needs to hurry up and shoot a nuke to wake this stupid country up to reality. And now the media is gonna twist it more to make even more people more mentally stupid.
He wasnt mocking the victim it was. Fucking way of getting around the concept when. My grandma died I laughed because I didnt know what else to do so I get Logan
Karma's a bitch. Its about time these idiots are recognized for the shit they do rather than it just being ignored
He deleted the video and made an apology video!!!
We all make mistakes. I am sad at the hate.
What a horrible human being.  And all his little cronies are with him, standing around and giggling about it.  Disgusting.
The real question is, is he sorry because he made a mistake, or is he sorry cause he knows this will damage his career.
Why do it in the first place
hes literally a sociopath, if this was the only thing he ever did wrong, then ok. But hes been shitting on his neighbors lives for 15 years. He will eventually be murdered or put in jail.
Not at all
I hate him
Definitely the carreer option. He is incapable of true regret like most human beings.
The kids i know that watch him are equally as disrespectful.
Hes not sorry, he was joking around with the body. Hes fucking trash! He should be banned for good!
He needs to be fired
Logan Paul ACCIDENTALLY went into a suicide forest. 
Logan Paul ACCIDENTALLY recorded a video of a dead person. 
Logan Paul ACCIDENTALLY posted that video to the internet to his following of 12-year-olds. 
See? Just a mistake. oh yeah he allowed used the hanging dead body in the thumbnail as click bait.
Fuck the news there always getting on people's business
allegedly
His fans are just ignorant 12 or younger year olds thinking everything is all fun and games when it comes to the reality of life.
this is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD
Logan has definitely torn apart YouTube. There's the side that hate Logan for uploading that video and are hating and there's the side that agree with Logan and have his back with this. I don't know what to do?
Breh stfu Logan is just straight trash and disgusting
Lol he he's a savage
Fatima Deleon what he did was part of his nature, being an idiot
+First name Last name there is
Look at all these hate comments, calling him a kid or little girl when you have a fucking angry birds pic or a fucking anime princess as your profile picture.  Sure, what logan did should not be easily forgiven, but you guys need the chill tf out.  Most of you guys probably dont even give a shit and just copy what others type to make yourself look good.
Maria Ysabel Delgado Finally, a person with common sense.
Smh, this people defending Jake Paul are idiots...
There should be an age restriction for Youtube
OMG this is all over yt
Stop getting mad a Logan pual Heres my favorite YouTuber  Im only 12 and saw the vid I have my own channel on here and Ill. Be making a video about whats happening mind your own business ABC people are 35 they know their abcs
You defend Logan and can't take this situation seriously? What are you, a delusional idiot? Do you know that he mocked a dead person? He had no empathy for him and his apologies are excuses to keep continuing his awful youtube career.
Logan Paul should have just walked away and not record the video because it just showed how him and his friends are. They were laughing and that really made me mad because someone ended their life due to an unknown reason and for him and his friends to have the guts to try to laugh at this is just disgusting. Suicide is not a joke and if you are trying to help people from committing suicide then dont show someone who committed suicide. I hope that him and his friends feel ashamed of themselves because life is not joke
unsub to you
I cant believe this is how we are starting are 2018
Phuck logan
He should be taken off yt NOW! Not good
Logan is horrible. He will do anything for views. So disrespectful
Followers!?!?
omg followers on youtube really
Unsub to this channel
omg 4 the last time he put a warning at the starting of the video so all can't go around saying things that never hapenned abc news. stop saying things you don't even know
Even if there was a warning, he can't not disrespect a dead person no matter what. Stop it with your delusional "defend logan" thing. He has made a mistake and has no empathy for it.
Logan Paul already fucked up and the year just started 
It was his copping mechanism dickheads......nd see the vedio first...he was educating people with humor against a sensitive issue.....LOVE LOGAN...fuck the butthurt motherfuckers
sorry is the milleniul way of  saying ooops. but im gonna get famous for this.
I SERIOUSLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WAT WRONG HAS HE DONE....
Its over its not a big deal
Yes it is. He has no empathy what so ever for the dead person.
The worst part was when he was talking to the dead men like he was alive. Frickin jerk 
MSM trying to take this poor guy down.  It's not like he killed the person.
he said SORRY NOW DROP IT YOUR MAKING HIM SAD THAT IS WHY I DISLIKED YOUR VIDEO SO STOP
Logan Paul has always been a SOB. He needs to commit seppuku.
I love you logan
Its not an audience of teenagers its an audience of little 10 year olds
Only kids are defending him smh
EDIT: if you actually support Logan after this I feel sorry for you and hope you learn to understand the difference between right and wrong
EDIT 2: brain washed supporters actually think people like me pointing out facts are in the wrong lmao yea ok
Melvin Harris: Great comeback
Smart Crackrr Mind your business and shut the fuck up.
Melvin Harris: Why don't you bother her with some real information hm? I've heard soap can clean a dirty mouth like yours.
Am Yav best comment I have seen all day
rebecca lewis "A single mistake" you know how much Japan hates us already? You realize what he did was seen by multiple countries , is about known by all of europe. They already have an issue with americans being jackasses and he just made that worse for us. He made it worse for any white man or women working overseas or even living on such places. They already all fucking fear having us near them. 
All these people talking about wanting to travel and shit might as well just give up considering we have multiple counts of assholes like that. You can't call it a "small mistake" because there are multiple things wrong with what he did and they are entirely fucked up and his dumb fans who are just as much of a jackass as he is , in fact even more of a problem than he is because they proceed to defend him despite even him knowing it's wrong can't bother to see that because they're so fucking narrow minded and don't even bother to find out why it was wrong.
I dont watch the paul brothers
I've always found him disturbing and as a young teenager I've always disliked his channel and everyone thought me wrong for it. And look at those people who thought me wrong now.
that's why i don't even care about Jake Paul or Logan Paul at all.
Every company funding this idiot needs to be boycotted! Period

Does it really trigger you? I mean shes not wrong in any means youre just little bitch
Itz Just Mairin ikr
Itz Just Mairin EXACTLY
Tks Logan for making Americans look shitty to the japanese.
How was he supposed to know he just wanted to tell you all that sucide is not a joke ok
If he doesn't want it to be a joke then why does he mock the dead person? It's just a excuse.
You know you didn't have to watch it no one forced anyone
But he also posted a video of him saying sorry logan Paul is awsome be a maverick
Wow!!
He did warn the ppl on the topic,
2018 barely started and ppl like him are already taking Ls
LEAVE LONGAN PAUL ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When logan paul dies I'm going to his grave and make jokes about him and record his grave , let's see if he likes that .
People he did not do it for views at all!and if u saw the VLOG you would understand the amount of shock he was in, all of u are just not understanding just wanting to hate, plus he blured his face, so I don't talk about stuff u don't know about!
Giselle Alvarez regardless it shouldnt have been posted in his stupid vlogs ! Both brothers are talentless and stupid . I cant believe youre actually defending him . Actors and actresses who actually have talent even say he should go to hell . But stupid 10 year olds try to defend him with the shitty grammar they have.
Myah Steele I don't know if u watched the vlog or not but he blurred the face, so how would the family know
Malcolm G yes he was going to do a 24 hour challenge in the forest, so ya shits and giggles
Maria Garcia first of all how do u know what he was thinking? Second if u saw a dead body would u really turn around and walk away? Think about it
agreed
Stop making logan feel so bad for him self and those tweets too when you called him that stuff didnt people call you that too when you were growing up.And yeah hes right its a learning experience.Are dont s guys like 30 when they wrote that tweet.Hes only 22.And Logan if your reading this Logang4Life
So he got a bad reputation now
It's so sad that some kids find him amusing, I am so glad my kids are grown and dislike this tool.
He just made a mistake does not have to be on the news so unnecessary
From my days helping my friend which is a funeral Director this is very very disrespectful and its nothing to joke about! People should not go to places like the Japanese Suicide Forest! Its a place to be left alone!!
Actually, suicide forest or Jukai, also known as Aokigahara, is a very beautiful place. It's a popular destination for tourists and even used for school trips. However, you are NOT allowed to be going off trails. There are some parts of the forest which are restricted, and that parts are where people ended their life. LP was going off trail, PURPOSEFULLY, to "look around". Such a disgusting individual. Smh.
Michael Stone Id go to the suicide forest but I wouldn't film anything but the entrance if i filmed at all. I tend to prefer experiencing things without a camera makes it more memorable in my opinion.
I watched the video it was blurred but it is still wrong to film a dead body cause god knows if the family that lost the man is watching he did not have permission to show his body and kids are watching what the 
Hell man
Please tell me this is fake and was not on the news
*SHUT HIM DOWN YOUTUBE!!!! THIS IS DISGUSTING AND  NEARLY 100% OF HIS VIEWERS ARE KIDS!!!!! HOW CAN YOU LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS???? OH WAIT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE HE HAS 15m Subs and MAKES YOUTUBE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN AD REVENUE????*
Yall are just making him more famous
im not a logan pauler i actually dont give a sh*t about this guy im a suicide preventionist on other people but im also a person that is suicidal..
Hes white so this was just a mistake he didnt know it would cause controversy....
great year start for him i bet
WHY DID HE NOT BLUR IT
this is why i hate logan paul fans, HE DID BLUR IT OUT, IT'S STILL NOT RIGHT TO FILM A DEAD BODY IT'S RUDE, STOP COMMENTING IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE VIDEO.
Dude, he was trying so hard to make people realize how bad this is. They made him look bad. He was just hoping this hadn't happened before, he was just trying to raise awareness.
yeah he may have said good things not to do but he still fucked up filming a dead body.
Logan Paul....you earned the biggest L of 2018.....and the year just started.
I agree
I hope they ban him!
What was going through his brain thinking that his young followers ages 8-13 would want to see a dead body of a poor man that killed himself.
His career is over :)
wow look at all these hate comments YOU THINK SAYING THIS SH*T WONT MAKE SOMEONE WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE EVERYONE IS REALLY F*CKING STUPID PEOPLE LIKE EVERYONE WHO IS HATING ON THIS IS MAKING ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE IM SICK OF PEOPLE BEING SUCH A LIL B*TCH AND NOT PULLING UP THEIR BIG BOY/GIRL PANTIES AND SAYING OH WELL..INSTEAD THEY WANT TO FIND SOMETHING TO B*TCH ABOUT CAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES BUT FIND REASONS TO RIOT AND WHINE ABOUT LIFE.....this is a suicide prevention video...do u guys think hes enjoying life more now that hes getting all this hate and he sees a suicide...wow no respect at all leave the hate behind...nobody deserves to be hated on for something that happens everyday....he should be told its ok and that apology is accepted....instead of dragging this on like a dog shaking a dead rabbit.....its done cant undo it go on through ur lives and try to help people not want to commit suicide unless everyone here just wants everyone to die.
See he apologized will you guys can't get over it you serious
Angel and Buddie that doesnt make up for making fun of a dead person Jesus are you dumb
HE DID NOTHING WRONG
Ariana how old are you
PURE SCUM ITS SICK AND ITS ALL FOR VIEWS AND $$$
It still disgusts me how he would still would post something like that. He says sorry but I bet he is going to do another stupid action again.I dont forgive him and your actions towards this innocent.Whos to say he will  do another stupid action then make another sorry video?? O please.
No this is bad content take down his channel
He didn't just show the body, he also made crude jokes like "What? You've never stood by a dead guy before?" as he smirked and laughed. As he made other stupids jokes and comedy skits near the body. And he barely even blurred the body out. Disgusting.
Sadly some of his fans are like "Cut him a break, hes only 22. It was a mistake!" Um, showing a dead body is a mistake MAYBE you can forgive....barely. But then making jokes about it and doing funny stuff around the body... that's not forgivable. You young people are so numb because of the internet that you think joking about someone who committed suicide is normal and ok. You can say otherwise but I've seen some sites you people hang out at like Reddit where there are super graphic videos of death and people are rating them based on best "puns" like a car wreck with a kid cut in half and teens are like "Kid has a split personality!". REALLY?!?! WTF is wrong with you teens today!!!  Its a person, a child. What kind of morbid person makes jokes like that?!?!?
Screw if you don't like Trump or Hillary. I'm more worried that these teens are our future presidents! >.<
Dont talk about logan paul like that
Antonia Montoya your dumb he mocked a dead person
You guys just targeted the bad stuff of him in that vid sure it was messed up but you just want to make someone even worse than they are you guys are just cruel to him
Beau Cunningham I get what you mean but he was laughing at a dead person does your mind not understand what he said
This is a "growing up" experience? Are you kidding me? 22-year-old men go to WAR. Have JOBS. Support kids! 22 is beyond old enough to know that this was wrong. Thanks for treating him like he's still a child, HE'S AN ADULT. He can face consequences like an adult AND LOSE HIS "JOB".
This is exactly why ads are boycotting YouTube.
My kids say they hate watch him haha yesss
damage has already been done well he did the awareness in the most disrespectful way possible
Its incredibly disrespectful. Its sick that people are standing up for him. The proper thing to do would be to not film at all and at the end say something about suicide awareness or not say anything at all. To video someone while they have just taken their own life is just unbelievable. You have to have no heart or sympathy for others. To make matters worse he was in another country. On behalf of the actually decent Americans. I apologize amd give all my blessings and thoughts to the young mans family who has to deal with their loss.
Fukan paul
he made a huge mistake and he deleted the video and he even said sorry and made a video about him saying sorry for his big mistake and it's good that he deleted it
Galaxy Univeres dude all u r is just hating and I'm not dumb
yosra nseirat your dumb
Roses are red 
Violets are blue 
If you don't shut up about the problem 
I will kill you
when the interpreter said that he wasn't supposed to enter the restricted area, he still think its a joke when it's actually a warning. don't act dumb like you didn't saw those signs warning people to not enter. those signs even have english translation. you and your friends don't seem to be talking about spreading awareness at all. all you do is holding back your laugh and snickers.
I saw the video. Didn't find it that shocking. It was a real life experience, stumbling upon a dead body and being unsure how to cope with the situation. Death is part of life.
Maybe i'm jaded..
Galaxy Univeres he was coping. I would maybe have laughed nervously as well. I rather laugh than cry when in stress.
queenira he was laughing at a dead person
*"15,000,000 followers on YouTube."*
I hate you.
Im so hurt and disgusted
Common youtube just ban him now
Not a good way to start off 2018
what the hell is wrong with people OMG A DEAD BODY grow the hell up who cares we are gonna see it in our life either way..ohh but what about the kids r u gonna keep death away from them everything dies...he just video a dead body and i think he acted ok in a serious situation u think ur kids will be tramatized for watching they probably already know what death is if u let them on the internet its not like they are there seeing the victim in real life they watched it on the internet they probably think its fake or the most part think its cool cause kids are twisted i think the only people who should crap their pants are the family of this suicide victim but i bet most people are only rioting because u didnt want to see a dead body but at funerals its okay to put ur love one on display for everyone to see..i am a suicidal person and i take the step to say he was trying to make a video where suicides like the one in the video dont happen...if the tour guy had a problem with him filming he would of told him to turn the camera off and im sure logan would of turned the camera off and would of posted a video of him sitting down and talking with the youtube family about how serious suicide is and how seeing it in real life changed his life...some people think suicide is a game...other people think suicide is really stupid and amazingly some want to stop it and say i want to prevent...im saying who cares to seeing a dead body on youtube im not there i cant do anything nobody else can do anything about that guys suicide but i say instead of crying in the corner and being soft weak cry babies i say we help the people who are depressed and have suicidal thoughts and reach out to them and drag them into the light and show them everything will be ok....some suicidal people see a suicide awareness video and soon later it gets old and they dont listen..this video could help suicidal people cause seeing someone commit it may change the way they feel seeing people feel broken and sad that that person commited suicide makes that suicidal person say maybe i shouldnt do that to people...i dont even watch this guy...
Sarah Crainick a dead body just a dead body that dead person was someones son, someones friend, someones loved one
he  DID NOTHING!!!! HE WAS JUST TRYING TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE THEN RAN INTOO THE PERSON!!!  At least HE CALLED THE POLICE!! he said SORRY in his new video! HE COULD OF NOT CALLED THE POLICE! He blocked his face! He didnt expose his face! Like u guys need to grow up!
I will forgive him only if he digs his grandma's grave and films the skeleton and uploads it to "spread awareness".
Just... shut the fuck up.
Sloth Godess ... you have to be joking ... He litterly FILMED SOMEONE WHO TOOK THEIR OWN LIFE, LAUGHED AND MADE JOKES ABOUT THE GUY....Then he goes to his computer intentionally  EDITS THE DEAD BODY INTO HIS VLOG , and USED A PHOTO OF THE DEAD BODY IN THE THUMBNAIL(for click bate),  but then goes on to say in his apology that he didn't make this video for "more veiws" but to spread awarness and help people... If he wanted to spread A warness and RESPECT THE GUY WHO TOOK HIS OWN LIFE, he wouldn't have made a joke out of the guy killing him self nor would he have made a video showing the dead body OF SOMEONE'S LOVED ONE!!! You need to grow up if you think that Logan Paul did no wrong.
showing the body of a person is like videoing the funeral of a random person death on a funeral home and makes jokes like "oh my god his cold! COLD AS ICE" n shit... it offends me for the first time recorded to a forest that people committed suicide.. and hell i love japan but not for animes but for there culture and technology.... anyway he shouldnt recorded in the first place and he KNOWS his subscribers are young childrens like u i never lile jake and logan paul in the first place... also the worst part hes white (im not saying all whites are stupid and jokeable but admitted most are stupid assholes who think there saving the world.... after i heard stories of logan shitape i lost respect from him negative to ZERO
Fuck you honestly
A way to start 2018...
Savannah Chisholm Okay you guys stop acting like idiots people can have their own opinion and thats okay I dont side with anyone and I dont care about Logan Paul but he said sorry what else do u want from him to kill him self ???????????? Next I get that he should have turned off the camera but just because people say he is the best you guys dont need to go being bitches sooo chill I get that everyones opinion but people make mistakes I just hope you guys stop bringing people down he may have done it for views or maybe he didnt we honestly dont know give your opinion and dont respond negative comments to others thx (dont like this post cause Im not a brat)
Polyhedrons I did the same thing #twining yassss
Alright, Im sorry that I mercilessly raped and impregnated a 14 year old girl and now Im making her pay child support, am I cleared up now?
I pray that your other brother is in heaven. To deal with your son killing himself is painful and I see the pain you and your other son have. May god bless your two sons and yourself and I hope you get better.
Julie D. Exactly sorry for your loss but Logan is dumb how could he laugh at a dead body honestly
I lost my son to suicide, so what do I want him to do? I want him to lose all of his sponsors, his youtube channel, his money, his advertisers, his fancy house, fancy cars, and ditto for his brother. My 11-year-old son watched his video. How do you think he feels, having lost his brother that way? Like it's funny?
I never was a fan of him so...but i do know my little sister is watching this idiot
Ay jake paulers where u at now
I like Logan but this is too much suicide is not a joke and it is very disrespectful to just put a dead man's body in a vlog or a thumbnail they have depression and it's not even their fault that the they commit suicide I am very disappointed with him even Jake won't do that
Wait was the body uncensored .
xKamariSims Logan only censored the mans face so you could see his body I know what a scumbag
Wow logan said he was SORRY JUST STOP UGH PEOPLE I HATE THIS
Hector Quintero just because he said sorry everything will magically fix itself well thats not how it works
Hector Quintero he said sorry how does that make up for the victim and the family and millions of kids and adults seeing the video do you know what he could of done he could of not posted the video
So are u on his side?
U friken stupid
I honestly hope ISIS beheads him. He's cancer of earth.
Guys he is apologizeing watch the video
Myah Hernandez that apology wont fix the fact he was a disrespectful son of a bitch
ITS SUBSCRIBERS NOT FOLLOWERS
He didnt mean it like that
Ya done fucked up douche bag
This forest is located near Mt.Fuji. Light and shadow are two sides of the same coin
Excuse me, popular???
He's fucking trash, he's not creative, he's not cool, he's not even funny. 
He's untalented. It's as simple as that. Also, isn't his channel aimed at children?? Yeah, process that.
I believe she didn't say he wasn't popular, he is indeed but I also believe by what she said "popular???" she meant him being popular for his dumb ass actions that made him be popular.
is that the only "insult" logan paul fans have.... really...
lmao nah, it's my opinion whether you like it or not.
I agree with you 100% he is an absolute scum bag. But you cant argue that he isnt popular. Unfortunately he is.
Animationwolfyumi14 lol Craig
Canadian news covers Logan Paul losing 15 million _followers_
Maverick BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIS
Wen u r digging a hole for people don't forget to dig one for yourself.
he's obviously an unempathetic p.o.s....parents really need to pay more attention to the bs their children watch. he's clearly dumb a f and a terrible example. that's why the only people who can stand his content are like 12 years old.
Stop hatting bitches
Well Logan was an ok YouTuber, but now he just straight up blew it like the Paul before him
Not to mention he was laughing and making jokes after he found the body.
99% of the people backing up Logan are like 12 year olds and dont understand what he did wrong haha. Check your facts. He fucked up. End of story. I dont care if he apologizes cuz its all bs.
Ya I know some people cope with laughing or whatever I get that. BUT... i feel like In some cases making JOKES just isnt okay. Like if I saw a dead body I would literally not know what to do and most definitely not make jokes and laugh out of RESPECT for the person who took there life. Just my opinion. I just dont think it was appropriate even if thats how he copes with things he still has over 15 million people watching and obviously people are gonna say something about him laughing the least he could have done is stop FILMING.
IDENTITY IS UNSTOPPABLE fr
he wasn't making jokes stfu
Liar watch the video  (:
Who would look up to him..
Idiots would. It is very unfortunate that parents don't check on their kids to see who they idolize.
Trap learn how to spell before you come at somebody neck
Janessa Tupas Saw a loganger/6 yr old comment, Who cares....the body is ded anyways it wont care either
I just wanted to vomit because of that one comment. It was so disgusting.
Watwazit at the age of 3-12
People roughly from the ages of 8-15 according to his demographics.
This is so stupid I swear Logan did nothing wrong
Dytto His spreading on awareness wouldnt stop me from committing suicide.
Dytto  I agree with you
Dytto Dytto he filmed , took time to edit and uploaded it , it is disrespectfull towards the victim , he had All the time to think about it he looked over the footage and still tought there was nothing morally wrong with it and uploaded it for millions to see he even fucking joked about it ,that is tasteless no matter How shocked he was.  he also disrespected the Japanese culture . The dead are very respected in japanese culture and he didnt give a shit . Even less about the victim.He is not innocent and if you do think so you must be missing Some chromosones.
Dytto, I can name plenty of reasons why Logan is not innocent:
1. Filming a dead body and posting it on YouTube is unacceptable. He had no reason to do it other than the lulz.
2. What he did, violates Japanese law. They are extremely strict about filming or photographing the dead as it is disrespectful.
3. Violating such a law shows that outsiders are not to be trusted as a stunt like this shows that people like him, not only have no care for the culture of Japan, but won't feel ashamed as he brings down those who wish to visit the country into the shit hole he dug himself in.
He has committed a heinous crime that no apology will make it better. He made it harder for outsiders to be accepted into a country that is hard to be accepted before.
Just cause I'm defending someone who's innocent he never had the intention to start anything
people need to stop hating on logan its not his fault he tried to raise awareness for suicide and they found the body and he just wanted to show it with the world of youtube and it was his choice to delete it and he did and he should not take the blame for all of it
Gubtan 21 yes!! Logan is good.
Gubtan 21 he said suicide isn't a joke, then made a joke about standing by the dead man. Please shut the fuck up.
Wow idk whether to laugh or cry
Gubtan 21 the fact you actually believe he did it to raise awareness concerns me. Get it through your thick skull that he doesn't give a shit about anyone, and all he wants is to exploit his young fans such as yourself to make gains. You're a part of the larger problem
Posting that video is a violation of the terms of service for youtube. That's only one part of how nasty he is.
He took a his life from watching Logan Pauls content obviously.
HE DID NOTHING WRONG , FUCK YOU IF YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY
Looks like his family (him and his brother) have been getting lots of attention lately and not the good kind
izaac gayton see I always thought it was just his brother being a douche, but I guess its a family thing.
but yet little children still defend and support them
Im mad that the reporter said followers on YouTube
So he went into Japan's Suicide Forest and found a dead person... What a shocker.
&He didn't mock the dead, he was just very suprised to actually find a body. We all deal with death differently and he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who deals with death that often so you really can't expect him to deal with it perfectly. It 's not like he cracked jokes about the dead person, mutilated the corpse or disturbed their peace. This is reality, seeing it speaks more volume than hearing about it. Many videos on Youtube cover this forest yet most never see anything besides trash or debri. Finding a corpse there was bound to happen and the only people who venture into that forest are the depressed and ready to die or the intrigued, ready to document.
Ahh, nothing like a witch-hunt towards a person trying to spread awareness.
Y A B O I 
Haha fair enough &well put. I agree he shouldn't have filmed it but my idea is he didn't really know how to handle it. Like he said in the video, it was his first time seeing a dead person. Also his behavior normally is borderline adhd, I don't think he could comprehend the situation mentally and fucked up in the end. I'd also imagine he didn't even know what was requested when finding a body. People keep giving him shit for laughing but I laughed when I saw my first body too. It's not laughing at the person, it's a shocked and baffled laugh trying to comprehend that it's happening and what to do next.
Many youtubers who go to the forest are told if they find a body, they have to turn off all their cameras and contact authorities. Even without being told to do so it would be absolute common  sense not to film it at all.
Good point about the grammar, although you put & right next to do and don't know how to spell debris 
Y A B O I 
No it's not about respect. They don't film the bodies because most don't find any. &Do yourself a favor and learn the difference between your and you're. Hard to take anyone serious when they don't know basic elementary school grammar.
Most youtubers who go to the forest don't film the dead bodies because they have a thing called RESPECT. Your also not supposed to go off trail because it's COMMON SENSE.
Well logan on abc wtf were you thinking jesus christ...
did he delete the video?
He said sorry gosh
Cutie Deer 
 So if he kills someone it's ok because "he said sorry"? Where's the limit?
Cutie Deer Deleted? Ive seen the vid more than 5 times in reactions and in reuploads. Once you post in the web it stays in the web. And stop following your god. Just stop it.
He can keep saying sorry. It doesn't mean he can take back what he did. And he was actually laughing in the video. A shit ton of people saw it. It's even worse if you're a fan who actually struggles or struggled with mental illness and saw his shitty vlog, because he made a joke out of something extremely serious.
Cutie Deer he aint sorry so shut the hell up u 7 year old
AstralRush Anyone with a brain would be "butthurt."
Guys need to chill its not his fault,
So when he zoomed in and got close to the body it wasnt his conscience decision?
He was laughing at a dead body
Game On Juan! Really it sure seems like hes the one who posted the video why dont I go and murder someone, video tape me mocking the person I killed, and say I didnt mean to murder someone because I was trying to spread a serious message about murder
I used to think logan was the better of the two pauls...
now i think jake is the better of the two retards
My man Logan fuck the haters.
AvGeek Im from the project in NY we are very ratchet out here. Im trying to get away from it. Anyhow just forget everything I said. Im sorry. I didnt mean it.
K Dot Im sorry 21 Im having a hard time believing that this whole pointless insult throwing session you had with me was the doing of a 21 year old
AvGeek im sorry I dont normally talk like this but when you replied back saying why dont I kill myself I got mad thats why I been going back and forth talking shit. Im sorry. Im not a kid Im 21.
AvGeek congratulation you played yourself.
K Dot oh and btw I dont get triggered every time someone insults Logan Paul like every single one of his fans youre also a pure example of the kids in logang easily triggered
"I didn't do it for views cause I already get views" That right there shows a clear indication of being egotistical.
Listen, I don't support him but they left out the part where he talked about how he said this isn't a joke and how depression and suicide are very serious things. Make sure you listen to the whole story before making up your mind on one thing. Yes he did something wrong, but shock fucks with your mind something fierce
Emily Form thank you! People are just totally forgetting the positive messages in all of this!
This is the part of the video the media took out -.- https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/logan-paul-youtube-video-latest-dead-body-suicide-apology-career-over-social-media-stars-money-rich-a8138716.html%3Famp
Joy Becker this is the part of the video the media took out https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/logan-paul-youtube-video-latest-dead-body-suicide-apology-career-over-social-media-stars-money-rich-a8138716.html%3Famp
lizzy panda Well I'm glad the body got help, I haven't actually saw the video because it was taken down by the time I even knew it was a thing. But I still don't agree on him posting the video, it should have been kept private. This was a serious situation that the internet didn't need to see. Even though the face was blurred from what I've heard, it was still highly inhumane to disrespect the man's body that way.
Purple Pillow Yeah but then how would of the body have gotten help? He did the right thing by calling the enforcement. He did stay there a little to long afterwards though I do agree on that..
On youtube you don't have followers you have subscribers
Aaron paul. Hey look on the bright side, Your a bitch. Logan apologized. If your gonna be a bitch then how about you go rot in hell.
KittyCatAmazing TV you think apologizing is going to magically make everything better well it wont because THATS NOT NOW IT WORKS
U r a cruel losing human
Who tf does that? This dude just ended his career 
gvbi unfortunately his career is gonna be fine since the only people who watch him are brainwashed little girls
It's on ABC news too he fucked up
fuck you
i hope his channel gets removed from utube...
Its sad that we have news channels taking about this stuff
Polyhedrons like its sad hes become so big his stupidity is broadcast every where like no matter what we say or do hes not going away he has everyones attention
solay what?
so instead of talking about mental health or telling people to get help if there feeling suicidal he did this? wtf is wrong with him?
btw your quote on him was wrong
What a piece of shit! Disgusting trash!
Logan Paul helped me so much from that video! I was about to comite scuicide when my phone got an alert that Logan Paul posted a video about it! When he was saying scuicude is not a funny thing and that the Logan is there for me is what stopped me. Guys he is so inspirational and always positive.
now THIS is shitposting
blueghostvalley in what word is it weird for a preteen to lie to defend their idols. Have you ever talked to a preteen? They are crazy. Remember all the girls that would scream themselves mad and mob one direction and justin? Let's take it darker. Remember all the YouTube fangirls that mobbed rape victimes and called them whores and sluts because they accused people like Toby of rape. Literally preteen fangirls are insane.
This sounds like a weird thing for a preteen (seemingly preteen) to lie about.
Abby Sherman there are hotlines and you have parents who love you and you could have gone to them instead
Abby Sherman literally go away liar. Don't fake a suicide story to take up for these losers.
U guys suck and you are like a dum media cuz y'all people hate him so piss off.
Every body stop hateing him we all make mistakes
IT WAS ON THE TRENDING PAGE. WTFF
I know! ! Not even YouTube cares!
Luke Lockhart he said to raise awareness for suicide stuff and prevent it
Youtube get your shit together!
PEOPLE MUST WANT TO SEE A DEAD BODY YALL ARE WHACK
Worst way to start 2018
Jake Paul fuck you fuck boy.
He recently released videos apologizing and telling everyone to not defend his actions because he knows he was wrong, so stop defending him.
WOW!!!! Everyone is so dumb why are people talking about this??????
when viners switch to youtube, this is what happens. please stick to other social media.
this guy is sickening. look at all the 8 yr olds in the comments of his apology
Fuck logan paul
Its too late apologize Logan!
H-O-A-X
Actually omargoshtv found a body 2
Logan Paul is an IDIOT!!!!!!!!! He likes to touch man pussy's too..........just saying
i saw the video when he went to the forest.i just dont know what to say
He knew exactly what he was doing. He isnt a child, there is literally no excuse. I saw the video, he blurred out just the face. You see the body, hands that are purple and the head is tilted. It was real. 
YouTube has some crazy stuff but this is literally something that I never expected to see; a dead body, on YouTube.
I mean seriously? He buys raw fish from the market, brings it into stores and touches their merchandise, rubs it against a Starbucks window then decides to leave it on the trunk of a taxi. And that's not the only thing he did, like wtf????
PJ Reactions Did you see his Japan videos? And his trip to Italy?  It's not just with the suicide video, it's clear that he was disrespectful in general.
EXACTLY! "raw emotion" my fucking ass. If it was a livestream, I might have understood why he laughed (some people laugh when they get anxious or scared, in situations such as the one he was in, however, he had time to not only go back and watch the video, but to fucking EDIT it as well, "trying to show suicide prevention" yeah right
PJ Reactions I just said i knew it was wrong but stop saying it's only him because I've seen too many videos with dead people, some guy found a dead guy in his garage bloody but his video and fine and people r saying cool! Awesome p! Man I came here to see the body and its soo cool! But l9gan makes a mistake apologizes and now u all fuckin gate on him but you don't see anything wrong with a bloody guy nothing blurted out shown on YouTube so really you guys r the stupid ones, as I've said I know what he did was wrong and I accept his apology and hope he continues to make videos
The age when people doesnt need to mature; click bait over human dignity.
Logan Paul Followers are dumb asses anyway. They probably don't know
What a dumb ass smh.. Now he can join Kathy Griffin lol 
Stop supporting his immature ass welcome to common life
Are we ingnore the fact that this woman said "followers" instead "subscribers" like jesus christ it even says it right there.
Alright first of... He said he was sorry "genuinely" but he had to make the video, edit it, then post it. And he never thought "Maybe this is a bad idea..."? Maybe he did but said "Screw it!" and when ahead with it anyway. Second, yeah maybe he is really sorry. He was disrespectful and rude to exploit the person PUBLICLY who decided to end their life.  It's disrespectful to the man and his family.  That being said, if any of the people at the scene of the crime said "Don't shoot this" or "Cameras are prohibited" or even "put the camera down" (Which someone should've)  and he just ignored them is even worse. And if his crew members didn't object to this im disappointed in them as well. 
Also the girl wasn't at all phased by the situation. I'd be an emotional mess. Maybe she got a little teary eyed, I wasn't exactly paying attention to her but her reaction is different than I would expect from a female. Which could very well be one of the hints they were "faking it" which is not okay with suicide being such a serious topic and all..
"15mil followers on youtube" what
Unfortunate but true. Smh.
Same thing
I know right
adorabeech@logan paul,loganpaul.com/hop
The fact Logan Paul is making all these news sites proves he really screwed up
he's a walking haircut.
Freemasons'conducting a humiliation ritual, and for the news to even spend the time proves that! MSM just like MTV is Mason TV and research Albert Pikes plan and what they are about by Google'n Morals and Dogma, Alester Crowly and the OTO, Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard connection but mainly WALTER VIETH ON THE OCCULT!
Logan only posted it because he does vlogs about whatever happens in his life it's not his fault he ran into him. he even blurred it out so I don't see wtf he did wrong #logang4life
I just want to say this: You never know what people are going through in life and if you clearly can't see that then there is something wrong. Also Logan Paul was about to cry so he was really sorry. Why don't you use your brain.
James Lutz I really don't care what you say about me because what you say to me is nothing. It is meaningless to me so keep on hating but I have better things to do than fool and play with you immature and disrespectful people. #nocyberbullying
Matt Bauler my boii you are right #LOGANG4LIFE
Your fucking retarded. Did you even watch the video he laughs at him.
Imagine if that dead body was one of your family members and this fuck head was laughing at his rotting corpse?
Logan Paul is cancelled
Im in the Logang and when that video came out. I didnt watch it because I knew it was not going to be a good outcome
is this on tv? if so, what channel for Spectrum?
emmelee ABC on spectrum here in Melbourne, FL, it is channel 7. It might vary. On your spectrum remote, open the guide and press the B button to search. Type in ABC and scroll down to the bottom, and click the one that says Channel next to it.
aokigahara live
I wish it was jake tough
Positive ripple? Suicide prevention? This piece of shit barnacle scum started LAUGHING after he saw the man who had taken his own life! How fucked up do you have to be to call that positive?
Hold up Logan Paul and Andy Altig posted a video of a dead person
15m follower that's instergram 15m SUBS that's YouTube u bitch
#Forgiveloganpaul
insane jake fuck off
Guys we all make mistakes and he did a mistake forgive him don't be rude
I don't understand how is showing a dead body awareness of helping someone? That's no type of help gosh what is going on with people
Man so many overly sensitive people. Dude killed himself in a forest (if it even actually happened anyway, I cannot find a video that actually shows the dead guy). If he didn't want his body to be found on display, he could have killed himself at home. Why blame someone for exploiting it for a bit of fame?. The news exploits tragedy for views on a daily basis, why fault him?.
he apologized to everybody and de are supporting him
He just apologize
he apologized
So people watch this guys videos?? This World is full of fools. And did that guys mom fuck a horse?
Maybe this will be a reality check to the man child that is Logan Paul.
your a sucker
YouTube star is the victim of his own PsyOp conducted by the Freemasons!
I really wish YouTube would stop giving these jerks a platform. He and his cronies are gross examples of how people should act.
Michelle G Thank you, you actually understand this isnt joke, like all these fuck tards in the comments
@YouTube fucking fire Logan Paul please, do this whole world a favor and dump his ass.
Some content creators get shutdown or demonitized but Logan Paul could get away with showing a full fledged dead body and still be making more money. This is sick YouTube. Fucking sick
he's not sorry about getting views from the video, a shit ton of money from the video or a shit ton of subscribers from the video people! He's only sorry because he got shit for it! that's how much of a shit person he is. If he didn't get shit for it he would still be happy with the video and not care about LAUGHING at a dead body
Poor Logan he rise awarenes againts suicide?
....Allegedly? IT'S A VIDEO IT IS NOT A CRIME CASE!
Guy cut him some slack he cant undo that
-_ - I do know what he did my uncle,friend,and dad committed suicide Ive tried to as well.its really hard to live with that but as a person I will forgive him and always back him up he did that right thing apologizing and taking the video down I think he has already took enough punishment he also has to live with what he saw and I doubt you saw the video and if he did it for views why did he tell half of his fans to click away and not watch the vid answer that
Tony Cohen Yea, for views. Just please stop supporting him, he did it for views, idk how old you are, but you just dont understand what he did.
-_ - he only laughed because that was his coping mechanism
Tony Cohen No one will fucking cut that shit bag some slack, he laughed at a dead body and made jokes.
Would u cut him slack if he was doing that to your mothers dead body?! Just think about it, and think about that guys family.
So... Won't he face any legal charges? Because I'm pretty sure he broke a couple of laws/rules and I guess YT is not very happy about this whole thing. They are trying to make the site as friendly for advertisers as possible lately and here a "man" uploads a video of the corpse of fresh suicide victim to an audience ranged mostly  from 9 to 14 year olds. It wasn't even age restricted.
He didnt take down the video 
Alexis Macias Dafuq?!
Such a Douchebag
Dont out hate on my boy thats being a maverick hes diffrent
He also showed a freaking dead body in his vlog, "my boy he's a maverick" well not this time kid
is this a joke? it seems a little sarcastic.
Different*
/Take _Notez\ look he does not care about you he is thirsty for the views
so ur saying hes autistic?
He is the scum of YouTube. I used to love his channel and after this Im done. I dont care what he says but he did it for money. He trying to make a positive difference but he is making a negative difference.
Namath Intemann yes
/\wntyePlts/\ Idiots preach
Julianna Rodriguez Im a kid idiot and use proper English.
Namath Intemann OMG of this  is and adult Logan forgived and WTF maybe I u are an adult u should be more updated on YT
So I can kill your family and say, " It's the past it's okay"? Extreme example ,but it's true.
get this
some of his obsessed fans are like "nothing's wrong about that" "don't be over dramatic" "maybe it's just a dummy"
They just don't like the idea that their internet God can do any wrong.
"I didn't do it for views"
Then why the FUCK did you put the dead body in the THUMBNAIL!?
He saw the body, he filmed the body, edited the video, and uploaded to YouTube. Tell me how this is a mistake? It never crossed his mind that this was not okay. Screw his apology.
TA A you are literally 12 , calm down and go play roblox
Was it okay for the Japanese to take their elderly there to die??
@aubrey cathleen FU
@Kaisha FU
@Elizabeth Schaumburg Some act like they've never made a mistake before. Gah. They need therapy!!!
Logan didnt know
He does stuff like this, gets put all over the news, makes a stupid apology video, gains more followers because people LOVE a train wreck, and therefore gets more and more rich.
I was just saying the he is a amazing YouTube  and his videos are  funny I didt what to piss anny won off so sorry to all who took  it to haret
There no needed apologize it too late he going have to deal with his own mistake he a jackass
Hes so stupiddd Dammn it!! What did he expect going in this forest a slumber party?!?! His appology was so self- praised  like I GET VIEWS hes pure trash !! So sad so many kids and teen look up to him  smh 
I would've laughed.
Haha...Rip Logan Paul...you could've avoided this...but no...you had to upload that suicide body exposure video on the 1 st of January 2018 didn't you!!!???!!!
He didn't attempt anything but views, but he ended up looking like a piece of garbage. His channels need to be suspended.
I knew this would be on the news
Show some respect dude.
i am just saying soo fuck off he is funny
His evil ass.
Fuck Logan Paul
No, he's not sorry... it's marketing. let me go search whos this guy... next thing you know he's up 5million subscribers bc of this dumb abc propaganda
Family and I were watching this and my parents turned to me and asked
*You watch this piece of shit on YouTube?*
positive?? raise awareness?? only an EXCUSE bleah
mistake?? he had that crazy hat, he wanted to do en epic thing in the YouTube in Order to gain more views, he has no respect, no sensititvity, no compassion, no taste whatsoever, so sad he has been called a role model
+AstralRush nobody with a heart make fun of suicide victims, so shut up
mi 13 your comment bleah it's a excuse to make fun of him
rulethefool it was monetized tho...
rulethefool and if he really wanted to raise awareness why not just sit down and talk about it you don't have to show a dead body it's like Raising awareness of cancer and showing a cancer patient dying also suicide is the second cause of death in Japan so there already is awareness and a rapper (logic) posted a song about the suicide hotline and the number was the name of the song but he didn't show a dead body he showed the pain and it was one of the most popular song in rap so there is sooo much awareness
He wanted more rates so more money
1: I thought his name was Jake paul. I'm confused. is this someone else? 
2: why does anyone pay attention to this twat, anyway?
I WANT THE FAMILY TO SUE HIM AND MAKE HIM DELETE HIS CHANNEL
Wow another YouTuber acting up
Are all yall seriously this upset about it? Man I swear ppl cry for everything now a days thats y ppl needa defend them selfs and not be so weak. N take the easy way out ik ima get a lotta hate but Im serious parents need to teach there kids to be strong n dont let ppl push them to do this its sad
Raiyn Walker would never happen and id be sad but u gotta think about it if they didnt want ppl to see them they wouldnt be doing it so the public could see they would do it in private but they didnt
So if that were your mother hanging on that branch and good 'ole Logan Paul came stumbling in and decided to make a video about her, how would you feel about it?
Rock And Roller ur the 1 coming at me lol n I have the problem?
Mark Meza You're fucking brain dead lmao
Wtf are you on about? Set your bravado aside for one minute and you might understand why people are upset.
I dont even know or care who this guy is.
This is just disgusting and disturbing.
Him: I did it not for views
His thumbnail is a picture of him having a selfie with the dead body. 
People: rigggghhhhttttt....
more reason to ban YouTube. I'm all for it.
MaskHero Zo get off YouTube lol no 1s making u watch it
Who knows logan paul is an actor that dead body could have been fake its what he does for a living but still it is pretty fucked up for what he did
I've always hated him. This makes me hate him even more
Mystical Girl You make me want to pull out my fucking hair. You're so dense as putting words into my fucking mouth. I never said ANYWHERE that I don't care about people who commit suicide. Stop talking to me. This is why I should have never commented on a stupid Logan Paul video that is discussing this.
So you are basically saying you don't care about people who commit suicide and/or who have depression and self harm.Because he did talk about suicide and how it's now a joke in the video twice not once but twice.So he did not do it for views it was an awareness.And if you are actually stupid enough to think he did to make other people feel bad or to just make views or for fun you are wrong.
I wish he suffers alot due to his dumb ass post!
Yup. I have always thought that Pauls are not the smartest people, but now it's legit. Those men don't deserve children...
JohnTheBabyDuck same 
eh, i always knew he was an awful peice of sh*t.
That video broke my heart honestly. I could not fucking believe it when I seen it. The amount of disrespect that was shown to that man is un fucking believable.
Mark Snchez nice one, bro, calling suicide/depression stupid
Jolie Mou can you fuckin shut up !! He is a bad guy who laughed at a dead guy and posted it on the internet so stop defend him
Mark Snchez some people have this mental disorder called depression, or schizophrenia  which causes them to think of killing themselves or hear voices insulting them and telling them to kill themselves. watch "schizophrenia simulation" on youtube. If I had to live like that I would fucking kill myself.
Mark Snchez you didn't know his life, stop being insensitive
Heather Louise insensitive ? hahaha I mean yeah I would feal sorry for the guy if he got murdered but to hang himself that's like the stupidest thing you could do plus IDK why people are so mad it's his YouTube channel he can do whatever the fuck he feels like and you don't need to worry bout me you bimbo I'm out
Aaaand it's on the news, goodbye Logan's Career
ain't the end of the world is it. them woods are known for it it's an every day thing in Japan in those woods
Jake paul can go to hell tbh
SilentSense1 How could you wish for someone to go to hell. I understand he made a mistake but that shouldn't result for you to wish him to hell
You mean Logan no??
Hailie K Whats the difference? Lol theyre both idiots
SilentSense1 you can go to hell
Spherical it's the older retarded brother
The Paul brothers are and always will be straight fucking cancer.
Why is he relevant?? Why pay millions of $$$ for someone who is so disrespectful of everything? Is this a role model we want for our kids??
AstralRush  My ass he did!! He wanted attention!! This wasnt a mistake as people are calling it!! He made the worst judgement possible with millions of people watching!
People/companies will think twice now!!
Diane Fitzpatrick he's relevant cause little girls exist only YouTube is paying him and anyone who he acts for and also we don't choose are childrens role models nor can we do anything to Logan Paul directly since his audince is little girls who treat him like a god and will watch his videos that run ads no matter what
He should have cut the camera and left
@Arely Ochoa 
He could have cut the camera off not posted the video in the first place and called the police it's not that hard stop defending him.
Zorg 47 BUT THE CONTENT
and not call authorities?
Well at least he called the police
Morgiemoo 222 EXACTLY
RIP Fuckboi!!!! lmao
This isn't such a joyous occasion to be laughing about. Don't you remember what happened during the PewDiePie controversy? And he didn't film a dead body. In my opinion, this is a million times worse because he doesn't even have the luxury of trying to claim it was a joke in poor taste or anything.
This is going to end up being adpocalypse 2.0
Logan is an awesome person fuck you guys
Captain Obvious just because you think hes awesome doesnt mean he doesnt have to face consequences like everyone else
He makes more than all of you assholes
No ethics all for money he do not care for humans only money
TommyTom the sad thing is they won't stop because they're brainwashed kids who don't understand properly how disgusting an horrible he is
If you see the full video he said he didnt monetize it so he didnt make money off the video.
He didn't monetize it, but in that video, he mentioned that there's no way the video would ever get monetized. So it's not exactly a noble gesture on his part. It's purely business for him.
Red Head99 Shut the fuck up. Logan did it for attention. You need to stop defending this dumbass.
Despiertame Con un cuento how you know
Logan fucked up
god how did I know this was gonna make headlines when I saw that disgusting title.
Too bad he's not the dead body yet 
Logan Paul is a serious piece of shit but come on man. Don't wish death on people. Not cool.
Gamer narwal I agree
He shouldn't have posted that.
Take away any funds he garnered from that viewing.
The problem is, he didn't monetize that video. When you're as big as Logan, brand recognition is far more important than single-video payouts. So, we'll never know exactly how much money he makes as a result of that video.
Annie Mitchell he didn't get any money from it the video didn't have ads
Fucktard.
I have PTSD vision loss from witnessing my husband's suicide ! I'd kick him in the balls if I see him
Tina Bishop he is making sure his viewers don't commit suicide
: Insta:savage_kingdom Then why are you here?
Ben Grazer Why don't you you fucking waste of air.
+Tina Bishop Give him another kick for me please.
Tina Bishop im so sorry you had to witness that
His channel is aimed at children... what child (or adult) would want to see that?
this isn't the first time hes exploited death for views actually.
TableStable His content was trash anyway
I agree
TableStable U ARE DUMB GHO TO TWITTER INSTEAD
How rude...
joe cole ur point?
@AstralRush  is still a kid.
AstralRush can you not paste this reply in every comment. Logan fucked up and were just acknowledging it.
AstralRush recording a corpse, zooming in, laughing at it, and uploading it to YouTube is not a mistake.
Whose Logan Paul? Lolz
Hes a fanny
why is this shit monetized
Starting 2018 on the right foot -_-
Ikr XD
And tripping,
Down a cliff
RIP LOGANS CAREER LMAOOO
I WISH...but we all know his little fans aren't gonna let that happen
Bernie Sanders YASSSSS DRAG HIM SIS
Bernie Sanders I doubt it, I mean look at RiceGum, he got destroyed but his 9 year old fans are still sucking him off.
I believe he is really sorry, and for that I'm still going to watch him. I believe in second chance
Original video of the vlog reuploaded to my channel
He exploited a dead body for views? He filmed a person who committed suicide, made a conscious decision to edit the video, and post it. Then he lies and says he didn't do it for views. His account needs to be suspended forever. I would never support anything he is associated with.
Polyhedrons what can you do to a die-hard fans anyway
New Jack Swing evidently the people responding to you didnt read your entire comment, but the first sentence. You said he, made a conscious decision to edit, and post the video. There is absolutely nothing you can do to defend this guy after that sentence. And I cant believe people actually believe this dudes lies. Make a positive ripple(lmao) on the internet. What the fuck would filming a dead body do for the internet, does he think hes gonna stop people from committing suicide like that?
All the ten year old Logan Paul fans are so annoying. Logan said NOT to defend hin
He is ugly af to me him and his brother Idc
Spot on
I hate that I share the same first name as him and that my younger brother (8th grade) likes him.
Gavin Richardson do you even know what gay means. lmao let me guess you learned that from logan paul  there are so many dickriding logan fans like you in the comments section
Logan Cascio I feel so sorry for you 
You need to help him before he ends up as disgusting as Logan
Art Trash that's good
Logan Cascio I feel sorry for you
Fuck off you are gay
Someone Explaine What Heppened!?
sophia plays He post a video over A popular Japanese suicide hotspot called suicide forest in which he found a dead body and continued to laugh and joke and show the dead body to his viewers. He made snarky remarks about the dead body and zoomed in to show his viewer how the body looked.
Logan paul stinks and his channel should be shutdown
Gianella For life Why did youreply if you dont care. Weird ass lier.
THAD YT 
I really don't care what any of you guys say to be honest
Gianella For life Oh boo hoo Poor Pauler fan he's getting cursed at on the fucking internet. Your douchbag role model Logan curses alot along with Jake Paul who's cheating on his girlfriend for real.
Gianella For life And Logan's apology can't fix anything either, he's still loosing views.
THAD YT 
Cursing does not fix anything
What a waste of a human being, fuck this dumbass.
logan is amazing YouTube
fuck uuui7
Kittylovespie Kittylovespie by posting this comment, you are showing the contrary of what you are saying.
People make mistakes all the time. Logan and Jake Paul have a pattern. Its not the first time. Yet, his YOUNG fan base are still very blind... children and teenagers are growing up thinking everything is fair game in life. They are growing up watching these kind of entertainers believing its the only way to be entertained. 
I can see how people are trying to open these little kids eyes, they seem to be very blind. I support that.
All Ive ever heard from Jake and Logan Paul is dehumanizing everything they touch. 
Check yourself. 
If you dont believe in what Im saying, read your comment again.
Kittylovespie Kittylovespie what you just said, made no sense what so ever. Nowhere in your incoherent, idiotic, rambling did you ever even come close to a a solid point. May God have mercy on your soul
Savannah Chisholm said no one ever 
Savannah Chisholm Okay you guys stop acting like idiots people can have their own opinion and thats okay I dont side with anyone and I dont care about Logan Paul but he said sorry what else do u want from him to kill him self ???????????? Next I get that he should have turned off the camera but just because people say he is the best you guys dont need to go being bitches sooo chill I get that everyones opinion but people make mistakes I just hope you guys stop bringing people down he may have done it for views or maybe he didnt we honestly dont know give your opinion and dont respond negative comments to others thx (dont like this post cause Im not a brat)
THIS GUY IS SUCH A DOUCHE BAG!
Galxer The Dutchie you are right he is my biggest favorite youtuber
Unicorn Willo Vlogs you dont laugh at someone after theyve just killed themselves.
F***you because he just made a video apologizing
Baby Bear what name is that for that kind of a guy and you are the douche bag he just wanted to tell u guys that sucide is not a joke
S 1 RIGHT
Only a true ass would/could do such a thing..  It's 2 late to apologize..
Its too laattteeeee *onerepublic song XD*
Your emojis really emphasize that point youre trying to make
thxbangta
   #Sorry is as #Sorry Does...
Oso Adventures 
  Poor Judgement... Careless Message... This Man Should Not/Be Not Given Thought To As A Roll Model.. Yet there are those who #worship#this#stooge
Well I agree with you he is very stupid and it does not mater what he said.
What a jackass.
Lol sounds white
Seraphim Light Bearer WAIT SO U JUST AGREED THAT EVERY RACE IS EQUAL BASICALLY so howre u still racist? also just like to add in u dont know if im black so all the insults towards black ppl r useless they just make u look like u were raised by losers who neglected to do right raising.

Lol sounds racist

targannington wow youre actually fucking stupid. props to that comeback;)
Trump killed the Japanese Guy!
You guys are just as painful, to mock this situation and support it more, do you guys even have empathy for that man who has killed himself? Btw zorg, I've seen your comments and I thank you for being a good man, thank you for showing the truth to these idiots who defend logan or mock the situation.
-_- Trolls.
Rob Simpson Ok, tell me, how did Donald kill that innocent poor man?!
Oh fuck off, at least he is better than lying Hillary and you

My family owns a farm and we dont do this
Hopefully no vegans say oh you break there heads off but we have to keep them in cages that are because animal snatchers
All people must slaughter animals in a humane way for they wouldnt feel pain. Failure to do so will be sentenced to prison time behind bars and condemn the industrial slaughtering factory.
Wow why people don't think God created this creature. People don't read the bible these people don't care for these poor creatures god please help us these abusive people don't even care nothing at all 
All I can is GO VEGAN people it might make them stop doing this
If they dont kill chickens we will be died 
this is like hell for chickens. this is absaloutly terrible. chickens should be killed peacefully.  actually, they shouldn't even kill chickens!!
You peoples that work there don't believe in god
How cruel
i know its like a cruel thing but we are omnivore creatures would you prefer if we killed wild animals for food and all of them end up extinct? no
also im against not the killing but the way they raise them they hit them they put them in dificulties and more things this is what i think is wrong
i wish i could blow that industry and free all of em
I still love my Chicken Nuggets
animals should be made to feel comfortable until the very end and when it is time they should killed quickly and painlessly but this is vile this is evil! needs to be stopped
This is vile

Mercy
How can people be so cruel
I just want to say one thing the company is shit
Damn its cruel but I cant resist eating chicken wings
THEIR CHICKENS !!!! WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THEIR WELFARE, YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY.
You need to find the order of visible creations, on your own, in order to estimate the probability of reincarnation in human form for a soul having a single un-punished crime on its tab.
The unit hydrograph concept. Spoon feeding is bad for kids.
I wish I would have studied electro-megnetism as well.
A jassad has no soul, only ghost. Think rationally.
The baldies are serving us. We don't serve them or any other species other than our own.
People being like poor chickens but still eating them...... wut???
Sure I eat chicken, but I really can't control how they die, neither can anyone else. If it was up to me I'd have them, and all other animals killed alot less cruel. So yea "poor chickens" I feel bad, but I'm not going to stop eating them just because of things like this. I can't control it and neither can you, the human race is cruel and always has been. My suggestion is if your sensitive to this sort of stuff than just ignore it. 
Why does this video have more likes than dislikes
Everyone here is a vegetarian or a hypocrite.
Why did gods create us?
Is this whole comment section just vegans? Or no?
Oh... That's terrible... what's wrong with these people...they don't have a heart...how can they treat another life like this.... bloody raskals....
(me: *takes another bite of my chicken wings*)
This is why you should buy humanely raised
:(((( this is sad Im going to DIE I NEED A THERAPIST!!!
If I ever saw the people that are doing this im gonna knock um upside the head and make them bleed
I hate when people slaughter farm animals some people say oh it's life but when it happens to a dog they are called cruel
We only need them for food
Who cares
I Cried for real i love chicken to
That's why slaughter  according to Islamic way. Please  learn about Islam
They r going to die just treat them them nicely in there last days!!!?!
Every sentient being deserves to live!  Please consider adding more plant-based foods to your diet: https://chooseveg.com/vsg/
The f is this?! This is literally terrible animal abuse! Watching this made me cry. :'(
It's awful.  To help animals suffering on factory farms, please consider adding more plant-based meals to your diet: https://chooseveg.com/vsg/
So cruel #chickenslivesmater
When I'm older I'm going to work at the RSPCA to help rescue animals
@mercyforanimals 
Amazing! 
Maple lodge farm gives u cancer...... so dont eat their food!!
I am happy Im allergic to eggs  this needs to stop 
It certainly does! https://chooseveg.com/vsg/
Is this at the facility down the street from me on Winston Churchill?
This is why I'm vegan.
A very, very good reason.
this video made me partially cry. chickens are my favorite animal!
It's so awful. 
Chickens are my favorite farm animals. It hurt to see this...
I hate people who kill animals
Woah.  Thats some good information to lose faith in humanity.
I do own chickens but i would NEVER eat them or do something like this.. i'd say chickens would be used for eggs not for meat
I Love meat products but seeing this kind of video wont stop me from eating meats, but it made me choose which company should i trust when it comes to processing the chickens, this company kills chickens in inhuman way! They dont have mercy into animals
If you are interested in eating more plant-based foods and cutting down on the amount of meat in your diet, this can help!https://chooseveg.com/vsg/
EVERYONE SAVE THE CHICKENSSSS
Why don't we eat male chickens?
Male and female chickens are both used for food.
Poor chickens Rest In Peace my babys
So sad...
Im sad they are innocent birds 
SAVE THEE CHICKENSS
IKR LETS SAVE THOSE CHICKENS
*crys* WHAT THE FUCK
im crying 
SAME HERE WE SHOULD SAVE THOSE CHICKENS
Im so happy I never liked eggs
This hard to watch i even stop at 0.32
*wow!*
*all frozen!*
*wat the fuck!*
*popsicles!*
Terrible...
Maple Lodge is a stupid company...
Omg why?!? What did the chickens do to deserve this?!?
They didn't. 
I'm not saying to be vegeterian but, for god  sake, just do it quick without pain!
Sadly, there's no humane way to kill someone who doesn't want to die. If you want to try more plant-based options, this can help!https://chooseveg.com/vsg/
This company should be shut down for being so inhuman
Is a legal slaughterhouse though. Its illegal to kill animals and they let them do this
Sadly, this kind of cruelty is happening at slaughterhouses all over the world.
it's so sad!!!if If i was there I would go save the chickens and take care them and then the chickens will  have a happy life just like humans do
Maybe one day! 
I left every non veg..but how to stop this slaughter
Thank you for your compassion! Please help spread the word by sharing information and videos like this. 
Omae wa m shinde iru
Is it really EXPOSING if we already know how my chicken is ready to put on my plate? not really no. We all know how it ends brusky
All the more reason to avoid paying for cruelty. https://mercyforanimals.org/files/VSG.pdf
damn this is why kfc is chicken is greasy...
I WILL SUE THEM
Help these little guys
Pls don't eat animals.
Happily in finland none of tgis happens
Sadly, abuse happens everywhere.
So horrible
Agreed...
This is wyd u don't eat meat
So true!
This is sad. I'd rather be eating a veggie burger. Veggie burgers contain ZERO meat and the patty is completely made out of vegetables.

i am trying my best to avoid eating chicken, but i can't stop drinking milk. milk is in many foods
You can do it, this can help!  https://mercyforanimals.org/files/VSG.pdf
If they were killed naturally not abused would you still be Mad? Because animals hunt and humans are animals
Unlike other animals, we humans can choose what we eat. Luckily, living plant-based is healthier as well! 
Shut them down
THIS IS MADNESS!!!
Couldn't agree more!
uhm im vegan now.
Thank you!
Hell is not under us it is us .obesely not me its those people
Thats hell on earth
So true. 
I wish those ppl working at such places have brutal and horrific death.
Why god why Im vegan now I
Thank you. 
Wtf!!!Why would you do that this company is disgusting.
Truly. 
please keep vegetarian dont use non veg
I'm all for eating meat, but there has to be a better way. I hope meat can be reproduced in a lab soon. Trying to eat more tofu and fruit smoothies. Wish i knew what resturants use free range farm animals.
If you're looking for ways to avoid this cruelty, please check out our Vegetarian Starter Guide: https://mfacdn.cachefly.net/tgp/VSG.pdf
1 like = 1 Chicken being saved 
Chickens are actually wise, they do recognize their owners. And also they can remember things for years. I had a 8 years old rooster, SHOCKING for me was, while he a kid of 2-3 months old, he used to sit on 1 branch of a small tree with his mom n brother. When he returned to that place after years after becoming old, HE WENT N SAT ON THAT SAME BRANCH, but he was alone, his new friends went n sat under another tree.
That's so sweet! Chickens are amazing.
Regardless of political views, this is disgusting!
Poor chicken
Oh my god why wont anyone stop this cruelty 
Don't kill the chicken
Oh God. This is horrible. How could anyone do this? I looked away from most of the video.
I cry so much to this stuff and not to brag, but I am so happy I dont eat or let this company profit from me. They are beautiful animals and are meant to be treated as such as do all animals. 
This is an abomination. There are other options, this is common practice with meat production responding to demand. You don't have to go vegan, just eat alot less! There are plenty of plant protein sources.
That so mean
Oh my god
Oh hell no poor chickens 
There is now a way to get chicken and beef with only extracting their cells which keeps them alive
why do so many people like this video!? whoever liked the vid is mean. thats not how you treat living animals
Disgusting
wow thats sick.
GO VEGAN
This is way too sad
And this is why I'm a vegetarian I don't eat meat never
What am i seeing. Such animal abuse! 
This is why I am vegetarian.
I proud myself, because i am vegan
Sorry no vegan but will not eat chicken

Horrid 
Thanks for exposing them home they stop
Don't just stop chicken abuse , but STOP all animal abuse.
eat vegan sausage sandwiches, mmmm
if you eat chicken you can't complain cause you're doing this
Were not doing this. The companies who want to gain as much money as possible, no matter what, are doing this. Most dont know about these horrid conditions. Dont blame it on us.
Were Monsters

While its certainly true that animals pay the ultimate price with their lives, farm workers are also oppressed by the very same system that values profit over everything else. Learn more here. http://www.mercyforanimals.org/heres-what-youre-missing-when-you-say-i-dont

No offense for the people who love meat, but torturing animals like this is unacceptable, Non-veg people should know their meat.
Can we get this place shut down?!?! This is awful
I cried watching this cus I love animals
Mercy
Ew! Im so happy I do not eat chicken. I love some veggie burger and salad 
Horrible....go vegan
They should remember all life is precious.
Imagine you were the chicken and you had a family,
But you were slaughtered...
Workers in the industry just work to keep up with the demand for these products. The best way to protect animals from situations like this is by going vegan! Learn more here.  http://www.mercyforanimals.org/if-youre-mad-as-hell-about-factory-farming
How painful and suffocating was that
Jesus man
How can some people even try to justify this?
Well guess who is going vegetarian
Chicken tastes good, but when they are treated like this, Im not eating it. They deserve the same respect as we do! Mercyforanimals
Right!? Why eat anything that had to suffer to end up on your plate? Thankfully, there are a lot of plant-based options!
this is disgusting and sick. If you are going to kill these living animals  at least treat them good before u kill them it's ashamed those creatures deserve way better than wtf you guys are doing to them.
mercyforanimals 
They deserve compassion and a life of freedom 
Fuck Maple Lodge
But srsly CUTTING OPEN THERE THROATS I NEVER LIKED EATING CHICKEN ANYWAY AND NOW IM NEVER EATING IT AGAIN
poor chickens ):
#GOVEGAN
Guys, the more vegans/vegetarians means the less chickens killed! We, humans, need to stop and work together to actually make this stop!
I turned vegetarian 
I'm vegan
Yep imma be a vegan now
I turned vegetarian 
What is wrong with these people? Who in their right mind would do that? I've seen people ripping off ducklings heads! The fact they break wings, freeze, kick, bash heads in, and more is terrible! If they don't shut down these slaughterhouses I don't know what I'll do. I'm becoming Vegan. Helps that I'm allergic to eggs and milk.
If they'll die, at least give them a shot to make them unconscious, what's the point of leaving them shackled by their legs and making them suffer? Absolutely sickening.
My school had chickens amd thia is sp hard to watch
Those poor baby's. I wish I could take a few of them. I couldn't even imagine, my chickens are like my children. I don't know how anyone can do that to them.
Maple lodge farms. Yeah right, they aint growing crops or crap so its like. Maple lodge harms chickens

IT IS NOT HUMANE 
IT IS NOT QUICK 
IT    IS.      C R U L E T Y
Sick amercians
i would love to rescue all of them and take them to my place and give them hugs and show them the other side of life.
Every-time an animal suffers, its never right. Whether they be a chicken on some factory farm, a minx in a fur farm, a rat in a animal experiment, a insect in a glue trap or a tiger in a circus. Its all the same, its all wrong. We can do better.
Animal abuse should be illegal in every country
I saved two battery hens from slaughter
there is also a company or something that saves battery hens from slaughter called Free as a bird
Noooo :c
WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO TO YOU !!!!
Im vegetarian
Jesus
The animals pay a huge price for our happiness and convenience.  I think I am going to give up meat...i want to puke now.
SAVE THE CHICKENS
so happy.i'm vegetarian.
I'm gonna puke!
Thats it, I'm a Vegetarian now -.-
Nooooo not the chickens 
I wish i could but my parents won't approve they l o v e meat maybe someday when i move out ill start going vegan
You can take action is by leaving ALL animals off your plate. Check out TheGreenPlate.com/VSG to get started.
This is why In fast food restaurants I only eat French fries.
Hi Mercy for Animals Team - may I use this footage (with credit) in a video?
Hey! Please e-mail your question to info@mercyforanimals.org. Thank you!! :-)
You people are so mean to thows chickens you should never kill anamals you just don't know what you are doing 
Humanity?
it's so sad they're so mean
Don't worry animals, soon this will stop, scientist are inventing lab grown meat. Don't worry, my furry friends... 
I feel very sad about animals.
This is terrible. I never wanna eat chicken again!!!
I hope the police see this shit and arrest them.
I wish animals can fight against cruel people and be friends with friendly people
How old were some of the workers?
CRIME!! Watch Earthlings full documentary and educate the children the next generation they need to know the truth. Watch COWSPIRACY sustainability secret full documentary and make the connection. Remember supply and demand. DEMAND cruelty free. Veganism is the future be on the right side of history
I have chickens so you have no idea how this make ls me feel.
this should be ban as soon as possible .....I am vegetarian and don't support such malicious activity
Stop Abusing Chickens
vegan people are more successful in life
Everyone is sitting here like they actually care or have any amount of empathy for these animals. But the vast majority still eats meat and doesn't do anything to stop this except complain on the internet. Don't get me wrong, I'm not any better but I'm just pointing it out.
This is what mcdonalds does
I'm not eating chixen anymore
Fuck all of you . They don't know what's happening there scared and very hurt I hope all of you go to hell .
We can't watch
Ellias Garcia dude this chickens are dying and yopyopu want this chickens to die be vegan
OMG I'm literally crying because of the  abuse
Hire a group of hit man and have them slaughter all the works in the industries
No. Most of these workers are poor people who can't get better jobs in this economy. They become desensitized, and though it's cruel to treat chickens this way, you might want to think about the conditions these people are forced to work in. Do you think they enjoy this job?
Human rights and animal rights are often interrelated. The owners of the corporations are the ones who need to die for this.
Ugh... Why dont they just killed them anyway...ugh..*vomit*
Phong Tran Hai I have lost a 1/3 of my brain cells after reading this comment...

This is cruelty must be stopped this way of slaughtering Islamic way of slaughtering must be adopted which is hygienic and have a proper respect of living life

Mmmmm chicken
i fell VERY offended
I HATE BEING OFFENDED ALOT
it's actually not bad since people have been doing this forever and it's not animal cruelty its there job and the camera isn't hidden
chickens are good animals not bad i hate people killing chickens!
Do u sue these people?
In Belgium they are friendly with the chickens. I saw it. Because i work in a slaughterhouse. Idk why they do this like this. Fuck cruelty!
dicks
This is making me hungry
I don't understand why they can't have them die more peacefully so no abuse and healthier meat and every one would be happy
Did you jst say.. Healthier meat... Really.   Even if kill them peacefully for eating it is not right... Its like you kill a person peacefully just to eat him... If you were told humans tastes well and.. Are full of protein... Ri8..
Because... money. Its fucked up but thats how it works. They kill the chickens so there can be more of them, therefore gaining more money..
Business..! Awful.
Stop it
Get some help
Heiss, they dont have to die in any way .. they are not meant to serve humans.. fuck you ..
yep I'm a 4-H member broken bones and dead before slaughter is dangerous meat
they are gonna die anyway but seems like these people get a kick out of it one guy hung it up and punched it what the fuck the gross thing I though was the machine they had to cut the heads off very gross and evil
NO I'm a 4-H member taking poultry... broken bones and dead before slaughter is dangerous meat
I'm planning to be pesco-vegetarian
Poor chickens
And just like that I'm a vegan
" WHAT THE FUCK!? ALL FROZEN! POPSICLES!"
when 5 billion people demand chicken and beef.....well...
People think rodeo is abuse? Rodeos have good food and water for the animals and vets near by + they don't suffer them they actually do care for them and they do have WAY BETTER pens then these animals... The dumb videos they make about rodeo abuse is the accidents that happen which can happen wen if your lightly riding any animal.. Sure Mexico is kinda rough with their animals in rodeo but Canada, America and most other countries do NOT torture their animals!
Do u chicken food is drop off the sky.
what do u think how chicken food is made?
oh no
How can someone work here??!?!?
Bob Nguyen No you dummy, she's asking how people can work in these conditions and that it's terrible.
Email your job application at careers@maplelodgefarms.com if you want to work there.
bastersds

damn what the hell did I just see
Reality
What do you mean... You skin animals....but yeah this is brutal
You just saw some scarring shit
You just seen how your meat is preparing to be served to your dinner plate.
Oh sorry
rofl lol XD
Murderous Cunts!!!!!
Not only did I throw up but I am crying so unbelievably hard rn.
Somone says all frozen ! What the fuck Popsicles
guys its fine we don't usually eat this, no need to be vegan lol we are probable eating ones that were killed nicely, like they won't even feel the pain
at least thats what I eat cause I am muslim,  but of course many other religions do the same:)
I felt really sad because I have a pet chicken and I love her so much I would never do anything like that to her!
+Charlie Piper yes there is a way to kill animals without pain its simple and tbey won't feel it trust me
+Charlie Piper I mean I do feel bad for animals and I too though that they do not deserve to die, , but really why did god make animals, so we could eat them
That is being slightly ignorant, there is no humane way to kill animals, if you want to do the ethically best thing and the best thing for the environment and your health you should go vegan.
Watching a ton of these to force myself to be vegetarian;~;
Same.
Same.
HOW do the sleep at night
POOR CHICKENS
I am not saying I am going to stop eating meat just chicken and more vegetables and fruits and grains,and to the owners of that place how would you feel if they were those chickens,there living things to,they feel. PAIN!

Damn whoever put the cameras in there pat yourself on the back, wear some sunglasses, get your "thug life" t-shirt, slap Dat baby on, and play rap music cause damn son.
OMG and I love chickens when there alive and on plate but I rather eat less chicks. so they don't die all the time I feel so bad..... I have no idea what to think but this is just wrong so wrong that they are killing that many chicken and doing all of the harm to them
I'm NEVER eating chicken again
we dont have a choice its our foods. if people dont want this to happen in chickens then stop eating animals. I dont know how is the right way to kill animals. i suggest that they should do a video on how to kill animals the right way if the slaughter house did not follow it. then thats the right time that they should be penalized.
Horrific. Karma will get these bitches
dont eat hehehehe
dont eat hehehehe
this is in human. I do not approve it. i will have my revenge. Thank you.
stupid people!!makes me sick too
FUCK YOU ANIMALS.  REPLY TO MY FICKING COMMENT NOW

It's fowl treatment of chicken.......
this makes me sick
WTF?..My BBQ chicken and favorite sauce for dinner just got fucked!
lol chickens like aaaah "dumped in scolding bath" >=[
Now it makes me wanna do that to animal abusers so good.
I WILL NEVER EAT CHIC-FIL-A EVER AGAIN!!!!!
Listen, abusing animals is wrong, unless you have the intent on eat it. Animals kill other animals and eat them but you don't see no dumb ass vegan being like "NO BEAR! YOU PUT THAT FISH DOWN! IT DID NOTHING TO YOU!" Carnivores eat meat, herbivores eat fruits, vegetables, etc. and omnivores eat a combination. If you don't want to eat meat then don't but you have no right to say others are wrong to eat it. Animals die all the time all over the world. How about you go to Africa and tell the natives that it's wrong for them to be slaughtering that animal and eating it. Also for those vegans that say it's abuse and you're hurting the animal did you know that plants can feel pain too, they just can't express it. Cucumbers feel pain, pineapples know when you're eating it and try to fight back with atoms or some science shit. Someone or something always gets hurts when someone/something consumes energy. So either you STFU and go on with your life or just eat air molecules.

how about the bloods. where do they throw it?
Abusing and neglecting chickens that are about to be slaughtered? This is the reality of modern farming.
I am a meat eater, but after watching many animal slaughter house videos, I sooned believed that every slaughter house is full of sick, abusing people. Im glad the person caught it on camera. Those ignorant sick people should deserve a death penality and thrown in hell.
i come back to videos like this to reaffirm why I turned to a vegan diet. Living & letting others live (animals & planet)
@Parker N.your personal choice of how you want to live life, good day
You have fun with that, I'm going to stick with my juicy burgers and chicken strips : )
Fuck,  I feel bad for eating chicken now.
And some people still continue to eat meat what a shame
+Joanna Dearman In truth there's nothing wrong with eating meat. What is is wrong is how we kill the animals. It is completely inhumane and needs to be stopped.
I hate humans sometimes. Including some people in this comment section. What happened that humanity is so rotten? We're terrible, I hope we go extinct. The world would be a better place without us. We're disgusting.
and now the chickens... want revenge. rated g
I'm still going to eat chicken
this is so sad
terrible terriiible *bite chicken sandwich* terrible terrible
That is animal abuse why wood they do that the workers say they have broken legs and broken wings that just makes me want to cry imagine they did that to us chickens are like humans they are alive like us
Popsicles 
They are animals for petes sake, you think they can fight back to these heartless humans? No, these are innocent animals amd they dont deserve your harsh words. Stop
I will have a big as he'll places were I live a gzillan animals and no one will sluter my animals
While I find this sick and fucked up, I'm not going to go vegetarian over it.
+Miranda Samuelsson Meat tastes too good.
I feel like throwing up.
+Taylor Mordoch same :(
I wonder if the farms in south africa are this bad?

WHAT THE FUCK?!
POPSICLES!
ok all those people who liked this can go to hell
+Angelina Ashley I think they liked it not because they agree on what is going on in the video but as a thanks for sharing the info on what is really happening in these places.
feels like i'm watching a fucked up horror movie
I hate chicken now, I wouldn't even eat it if I didn't have a heart they are so cruel. This isn't cruel, but spanking a kid where it leaves a bruise is...
fuck maple lodge farms meat products
I wanna go to Canada and beat some ass
what the fuck do you mean this is how you get chicken
everybody who watch this why do this to poor and sick animals think of it is you being abused and dameg do you know when you feel alone no body arond  how do dose that feel thats what the chickens feel just think that of it
Eating chicken while i watch this haha awkward
oh my gosh 
To all of who who think this is funny its not these poor innocent animals are sent to die just to feed your ass
can we eat our chickens in peace
Protein. I hate animal cruelty towards domestic and endangered animals. But chicken, beef and seafood should be a source food of meats. The food pyramid. Yes the way how they are handling them is fucked up. But you have to imagine how people in the world eat chicken and beef. So the process of getting these meats to companies have to be very fast everyday and people need jobs just like this to provide for alot of people.
3:01 "Tell Maple Lodge, it's FOWL treatment of chickens has got to stop." Really, you just had to use that inadvertently as a pun.
TheAlmightySmelldoor I caught that too 
sorry don't  care just give me my chicken leg
Im not from america so idk anything.... How are you souposed  to slaughter chickens without breaking the law ?
The food chain unfortunately.
The Sack We don't hunt for our food.
The Sack This isn't the food chain....
I hate that guy.
buffalo wild wings it is
These dicks
This is SO DISGUSTING!

verschrikkelijk. gedeeld op Facebook
Chickens are people to
CHICKENS ACTUALLY ARE PEOPLE MY MOM SAID YES
no there not there chickens thats why there name is chicken because there chickens and peoples names.are people because there people
I'm crying
Nora Thompson same 
Chickens are actually wise, they do recognize their owners. And also they can remember things for years. I had a 8 years old rooster, SHOCKING for me was, while he a kid of 2-3 months old, he used to sit on 1 branch of a small tree with his mom n brother. When he returned to that place after years after becoming old, HE WENT N SAT ON THAT SAME BRANCH, but he was alone, his new friends went n sat under another tree.
I might turn vegetarian now fuck these bastards
OMG hate you people that kills chicken I will treat u like those CHICKENS
chickens did attack my cousin and i hate them so take that chickens stay cruel
if u dun wan dat bitchas abusing u gotta do dis 1 easiest stap:
1. NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER buy meat ur wat evah
this will result dem bitch 2 quit workin cuz of bank kruptyyyy
+Cow  (Mooo) I agree with you but your English confuses me.
i will never eat meat again
THIS DISGUSTS THE HELL OUT OF ME!!! NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WOULD BE SO CRUEL TO A POOR DEFENSELESS CREATURE!!! THESE GUYS SHOULD BE THROWN IN JAIL FOR LIFE!!!
How can u stand killing thousands of animals and still have mercy , you people are the main reason for this to happen , dont blame maplelodge and your demand we have reached this stage .
Plus u dont need to shock the animal and then kill it and normally we dont need thousands of blades exposed to necks automatically killing animals daily You are decieved by capitalism , led by the devils in the world .
Everything is wrong and u are complaining about some dust ahhhh .
honestly! you people need to just go to your local grocer and buy some chicken nuggets and get over the cruelty bs, do you really think that if they pet the chicken and kiss it on the head before they cut its head off will make a difference. come on you bleeding hearts, the chicken was born to die and feed you just eat of its nutrient flesh already.
This is shocking & those involved should be punished
I'm trying to give a fuck but I can't. They're just chickens.
Sad, but I am not becoming a vegetarian.
mother fuller
Poor chickens.. 
Americans
+Lawrence It's a Canadian company....shit face.
I think I'm gonna cut down my chicken eating diet even more...
I'm still considering going vegan I love meat but this shit is to much
honestly who gives a fuck? whats the difference between how our ancestors have been butchering animals for thousands and years and now? is it bc we use knives that require electricity instead of a large stick? chicken is a staple food in a lot of cultures. its disrespectful and ignorant AF for you (mostly) white vegans and vegetarians to shame other ethnicities for eating something thats been apart of our culture since forever!
Fuck popsicles HA HA WHAT
I'm going to use this video for my class presentation. I will give you full credit, thank you :)
Wow you're awesome
I'm gonna order some KFC...this video makes me hungry for chicken
this is so sad :(
People who are doing these poor innocent chicken fuck you all I am sick of animal abuser
As the law of physics says every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The pain caused to these creatures gonna come back to the those who r the reason 
FUCK YOU ANIMAL ABUSERS
They kill for animals for extinct they want everything toxic nuclear gas lot of unnatural stuff
What they do is completely terrible, but I still find it hard to stop eating meat... I only like tacos and burritos... And salisbury steak. :/
This makes me think of Peta and why I hate them and like them...
no quisiera yo trabajar en un lugar asi mismo si no tubiera mas opcion
This is crazy.
This made me a vegetarian 
If you need protein eat bread!
I can't believe how some of u guys are laughing it is not funny ur  less
Bitch 
OMG  someone should do that to you and  let you die and go 
This is sad f it were me
I would put them to sleep and then do whatever so they don't doe in pain 
New creepy pasta
00:00:20....why the hell, on this earth,
somebody, working at a chicken farm, would
ever, EVER.... punched... a fried-to-be-chicken!!!
Guys plz go on my channel like and subscribe so I can stop animals cruelty
MOTHERFUCKERS
There stupid
Seriously y this humans are so mercy less , 
I actually heaved watching this
This is just sick! People are ruining the earth and we are going to pay for it one day! 
They will be eaten like every other chickens. The lucky ones are the ones that are bred to fight
I am not eating chicken ever again anyone else
I think I might become vegetarian again ... :/
+Banana Melon lol
I'm not a vegan because I love animals, I just think plants deserve to die
@Roger Levy Why not someone who could make factories adopt the necessary measures to give chickens a quick death instead and actually make a difference?
Terrible
Don't watch vid
I hope everyone  who works for this company gets fired lives onthe street  and has their family suffer
Thank god M pure Veg ...!!!
M saved from the curses of all those slaughtered animals ...
What you gonna do. If the chiken was you?
nothing really because we cant talk. or defend ourselves or call 911 because were chickens and no-one will understand  us
Do anywhere have free range chickens or do I have to raise  my own in my backyard?  And how to humanely kill a chicken or any other animals for food? I don't  want a headless chicken running  around 
If i ever met one of these people who have done this i would hang THEM!!!! This makes me sick !!
Half of the people that say "this is the last time i eat meat" there lying, i mean i feel bad how abused these chickens are but im sorry i have to eat. 
YOU SICK, SICK FUCKS!!! DOING THESE THINGS TO ANIMALS!! IF I NEVER FIND ONE OF YOU, I WILL DO THE SAME AS YOU DO FOR THE ANIMALS. YOU PEOPLE DESERVE DEATH!!! 
Obviously this is an injustice.. They dropped names of company so take matters in to your own hands. Fuck man they been caught and that didn't slow em down. These ppl are abominations that are owed a visit 
1:04 Their all frozen! Popsicles!
"Mercy for animals" here's the thing I don't want to live life on greens and meat is an important source of minerals, protein and dietary fat. We can prevent animals abuse in so many ways without shutting down slaughter houses. Just stop being like PETA so ignorant. 
Never knew they had chicken flavored popsicles
Star Bros Mario Thats so mean learn manners they are animals for gods sake
Lol @vegans saying we shouldn't eat such animals. If we didn't eat such animals, they would have no use in society and pretty much end up as an endangered/extinct species.
Criminal? Did the swat teams bomb the factory yet and kill all the chickens along the process?
THIS IS HORRIBLE THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I BECAME A VEGETARIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I know people are saying "I'm never going to eat meat again!" But we do need meat! Meat has iron and we need that. It's very hard to be a vegetarian. But this is truly cruel! There are others ways to kill animals in peace
I'll never eat a chicken product again except the eggs cuz you know I need to make my bacon egg and cheese if you know what I mean
I'm eating Maple Lodge Farms baloney sandwiches as I'm typing this....tastes great and I can actually afford it.
Thanks Maple Lodge Farms
Maybe mercyforanimals can head over to the halal slaughter houses and report some real suffering.
Hopefully  Maple Lodge Farms sues you.
Sadly farms lime these are not illegal and the treatment to these chickens is normal at factory farms
I can't get threw the first bit 
i signed up for mercyforanimals and i want to become vegiterian
dude you eat it anyways it doesn't matter
This is why people are turning vegan  its because what happy to being more humane its just bad  nothing but upsetting..
MONSTERS! HUMANS THEIR SICK! THEY ARE MURDERES! 
AHH i couldn't even get through the first 5 minutes. That was horrifying.
People are turning away from such farms -- they are turning to farms where animals are treated properly with care & respect from birth .... e.g., HFAC -- "Certified Humane -- Raised& Handled" -- ALL animals are comfortable 24/7 -- they eat healthy, nutritious, natural food, no drugs whatsoever no matter what ridiculous reason, etc. Watching your video of the savage cruelty to and disregard of animals, I am disgusted and so deeply saddened that sociopaths are freely roaming our planet in addition to being employed by you ....
Smack heads
Thank you Mercy for Animals!Fuck you Maple Lodge and all who support factory farming
Fuck you Maple Lodge Farms! You greedy disgusting bastards!
Chickens are giving their lives up to end up on our dinner plate, so at the very least they should be treated humanely!
Thank you to Mercy for Animals and to CTV/W5 for airing the "for the birds" segment. And thank you to The Toronto Sun for the link to this video. Send it to EVERYONE you know, and do not ever buy a single thing from these sons of bitches again!!!
it makes me sick that people could be so cruel and apathetic towards animals period!
First time they have to spend 1 million... how much would it be now?
That company shoulddisappear
Spent the entire time I watched this crying 
fuck maple lodge farms. I'm glad I don't eat meat, but... holy hell, some of you vegetarians/vegans commenting on this video sound like cult members trying to recruit people.
Every factory is the same 
Thank you Mercy for Animals!
Sorry MFA this is so bad I can't even watch it any more.
People should support their local farmers markets. Try healthy happy pasture raised eggs, poultry, pigs and beef then you will taste the difference between a sick antibiotic overdosed animal raised in a factory farm. The taste and quality of a happy healthy raised animal compared to a antibiotic fed sickly animals raised in a factory nightmare their entire life is night and day.
There really is only one way to be fully humane with regards to animals in this life - and that's to go vegan. Come on, people - the time for a more INCLUSIVE sense of empathy and compassion is well overdue!
Couldn't even watch half of the video, what a disgusting company.
Brandonluco u mean is a fucking hell company
This hard to take. Stop madness!
@The Big Game Theory how about just stop torturing them? HA
Stop eating chicken. HA!
Pobrecitos de ellos. Y pobres de nosotros que vemos esto y seguimos sin hacer nada....todos somos lo mismo....cuando lo vamos a comprender...
What's for dinner!!!???!!! Chicken Oh Boy!!!!!!
ARM you are doing a great job to expose cruelty in the dairy industry. God bless you!
how dare that woman smile shame on her I hope she gets arrested
It doesnt happen in my country. So why should i stop eating meat?
My country don't import meat from western world.
so you aren't supporting the murder of innocent beings
Because you can. As long as there is demand, there will be supply.
just become VEGAN to stop this madness
This is just sad
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY THE MOST EVIL OF PEOPLE WIND UP TAKING CARE OF OUR PRECIOUS ANIMALS?!!!!! DONT BUY DAIRY!!!!! DONT BUY Coca Cola!!!!
God told us to take care of the animals! Someone is going to have to explain to God why he treated these animals badly!
What I don't understand is the point of the temperature outside. At one point the person filming holds up a thermometer and it says 101, then he makes a comment that the cow is penned up with no shade, even though that particular shot shows it in the shade. If it's so bad for the cows to be outside, then why do other videos taken at indoor farms say that the cows should be outdoors? It seems like it doesn't matter because the activist groups will complain either way. They should focus on the abuse, like the farmers grabbing the calves and throwing them around, or kicking them. That stuff is never ok and needs to stop and the abusers need to be dealt with
I seriously hop that the producers of this video relise that this does not happen in every farm. And the way I see it they are just brainwashing people into becoming vegan do not trust these videos!
Who are the beasts?
May all involved be treated the same. May it come back to them and anyone associated with them! Curse them!
So mote it be.
The mother fuckers need shot
HOW DARE THEYY NA UHH UH I AM GOING VEGAN FORGET EATING MEAT I DONT WANT ANIMALS TO DIEEE HOW DARE THEYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Save these innocents we are with them stop this creulity you did same with your children i sak these fuked dairy owners and their servants
These people will die very painful deaths...karma is so real.
For piss-sake, at least provide the calves with adequate shelter, like those plastic calf-hutches. So at least they don't have to languish in the rain and sleep in puddles. Enduring oppressive heat is bad enough.
Thank you ARM you guys are a voice of the voiceless and protect these poor things
You can take your plant based diet and shove it up your ass.
Dumbass dairy farmers. Why not just sell the male calves for veal? Duh! They'll make extra money out of it rather tahn killing the calves which is both a waste and shame.
These people who hurt these cows have NO heart, this disgusts me, thank you ARM for putting attention to this cruelty to stop people from buying the products they make.
LOL...those are burger..why you sounds so suprise?
I cant believe these abusive, dickless workers dont get kicked or stomped on! I wish they would!
Thank you ARM for doing something and exposing this sick behavior bringing it into the light
I feel bad for them for being  killed
All that for milk..no thanks
OMG!!!! How could anybody do such a horrific thing to a poor defenseless animal?  Maybe someone needs to hang one of these fuckers by the balls or tits and cut THEIR throat.  My goodness what have humans become?  Sadistic to say the least.  May they all burn in Hell.
We humans are the fucking leaving on this earth
5:09 THAT WOMAN WAS SMILING!! I hope she goes to jail for the rest of her life
ken hale I 100% agree
@meme beam - because she smiled, I think? I guess smiling is a punishable offense that requires jail time.
ken hale for what?
i know you never take baby & mama away. & i own 5 cows, & one just birth. & she is with baby's happy as can be.
id love to work there and fucking whoop all their asses and hire better people....if they had better people and treated them right, tbis operation coulr turn around. youd have to totslly move the calf housing because of biohazards but other than that better people, house calfs with mothers, beside them evwn if they get too territorial if in the same pen..not the same but still better than seperste.. and bam your good...
fuck those hooker cows
now i eat 2 steaks every time
They should do the same to these ass holes as what they do to the animals...see how they like it!
esto es europa asesinos por naturaleza
Dieren verdienden dat niet
These are some mentally sick mutha fucking people treating these newborn calf's like bull shit.
NONHUMAN acting INHUMANE;  SLOWLY SUFFERING AND DEAD,  I WISH THE BEASTS  SUFFER as these POOR INNOCENT CREATURES DO IN THERE CARE.  where is animal welfare now...... AFRAID TO GO AGAINSt THE SYSTEM, SYSTEM NEEDS TO CHANGE OR DOES CULTURE DICTATES MORALITY .......
Treated like the dogs in Yulin packed in a cage  horrific, I hope these handlers roast
dirty horor farm
Brutti schifosi. Morite
Meat is murder.  I will not participate.
Teach your children early....
Meat is not murder. Get over yourself.
Don't have kids, you'll do society a favor.
Cum Expender 
Meat is delicious 
Teach your children early
Im so glad Im vegan and not contributing to this in any way. God bless them.
I wonder how many laws ARM broke while collecting this footage??
That's just wicked. Farming does not have to be like that! Some humans are just evil!
That's Cruelty!!!
There so many idiots working at the farms somebody needs to stop this activity there is no human people
Dit is echt niet normaal en worden die mensen dan gestraft ,.
Was fr Scheisskerle! Wie kann man nur so unmenschlich sein!
No need for that cruelty
Shame the cows dont kill the bastards beating them
stop this diary
BASTARD..
BASTARD.MAN.
Who cares.
Many people do! But nobody cares about you!
So sad
