This was heart melting and beautiful...someone kind and compassionate helped someone else in need so that sweet little girl, her brother, and Grama could bless grandpa with a nice birthday cake and he wouldn't feel forgotten on his birthday, and the young man who did this kind and loving gesture for them was paying it forward as he was asked to by the kind man who blessed him on his birthday when he was a little boy......recently my husband and i have been richly blessed at Christmas time by a couple of very kind, loving, and generous strangers, as well as surprised and blessed by friends of ours and I want to say a huge thank you to all of you lovely children of God who have done this for us both...we love you very much and you truly make a difference in our lives and others....we gratefully look forward with joy in paying it forward also and it so reminds me of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for every single one of us when he paid the price on the cross for us and saved us from all of our sins when we were hopeless sinners in need of a saviour......He took our place and cancelled our debt so we can be reunited with Him, our creator if we only accept His precious and beyond awesome gift of eternal life, safe with Him........Thank you precious Jesus and Heavenly Father...I love you forever and am so grateful and amazed at your love and grace!!!!!!!.....I love you all too, my brothers and sisters ...you are ALL PRECIOUS..EVERY ONE...MERRY CHRISTMAS  AND BLESSED NEW YEAR IN 2020!!!XOXOXOXO XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO	3

You are a fool to name this video, guaranteed to make you cry. Crying is sadness this is heart warming.	3
I am Youssef from Morocco, a student. I loved marriage. A professor older than me she is 32 years old. I am 21 years old. I love her for four years and do not like any girl without her. I always communicate with her on the communication sites and see her directly. Although four years have passed and I love her, I have not been able to tell her that I love her and wanted her to marry because I did not have a job currently and she has a job and a monthly income. That made me not be able to tell her about me I love her and wanted her to marry, she is very beautiful, I loved to follow her on a daily basis, and I see her pictures, and also religious and respectful, so her beauty is wonderful and I always see her in my mind is the beautiful princess in this whole world, but I fear that I did not tell her that I want her to marry and marry someone else, this matter will make me stay sad throughout my life Because I always find her sweet and a wonderful aura to me, and I wouldn't be able to give love to any other girl without her. Please if you have any advice, share it with me or contact me on the contact at this number 0613361717 with all my respects to you. Thank you.	3

I get the video is good and all, but honestly when doing an act of kindness, you shouldnt expect anything in return. Even if they offer to give you something in return, you shouldnt accept it as to me is seen as an act of payment for your deed. Doing good deeds or giving up things just to get nothing is the sure way that people should live.	1
I wasnt sad it was actually happy	1
I didn't cry ;-;	1
This was pretty funny 	1
I'm way to emotional I'm just stressed and I'm weird so I watch sad vids to cry	3
So sad and happy	3

3:36 try not to laugh 	0

Kill them with kindness 	1
This actually happened to me before but with a zebra cake instead. Me and my sister went to a tiny store super close to our house and we didn't have enough money for a zebra cake. We put it on the counter for someone else to buy. But went we exited the store the man ran up to us and said that he paid for it for us. I was so thankful. I gave him a hug then left! Everyone can show a spark of kindness by just handing out a gift. Every kindness has it's own world and anyone can join it if they really try!	3

If we can make up a word i would want one where no one goes hungry, where no one ever died. But you know such a world exists already don't you? The lord made that world, the question is are you ready to join it? ready to throw away sin for light? to help others? The lord will help you through it just keep praying, and we should do this for anyone, rich or not I will do it when I grow up. And everyday i will come and see how many people had actually read this through, and took the time to understand. The lord and i love you all so much. Your always loved and your always rich, you just don't know it yet.	1

A little lesson, your parents  may not afford things you want (a gaming system, clothes, toys etc.) , but they love you and re working hard to keep you under a roof and making sure youre loved and smart. Everytime I earn money, I give most of it to my mom because I dont live with her and she works very hard. Love yall <3	1

cuz same	3
Yep I'm here just for that	1
I've been crying for a solid 40 minutes watching other videos	3
Me. Not because it's 2020 now. I really hope that this year will be a great and beautiful one. But I'm so drained from the feeling that i'm alone despite having many friends around me. I'm drained from the feeling, that i'm not that emotional because i'm walking along poor men without the possibility to help them. I'm drained from the feeling that i'm losing my deepest friends, because they study elsewhere or because we don't meet us that much except going to gym or drinking alcohol to be 'happy'. I'm drained from the feeling being not accepted by people because my origin.	3
And it is so ironic that i'm trying to cry by watching this video because otherwise i couldn't... 	3
I hope for everyone that they will be happy for the rest of their lives, but it's unfortunately unrealistic...	3
honestly, yeah.	2

Uh no, because NOTHING makes me cry unless it has happened too in my life, well LIKE if you want to hear the story!	2
So I had a bunch of friends, I had an across the street neighbor who was a year younger than me, 3 years later, I met a close neighbor which I became very close friends. Then my ATSN (across the street neighbor) told her a secret, a secret which hurted me for months. My DTSN (which you can guess) told me the secret: She didnt like me. Her mom hated my mom. She didnt like the look at my face I am which she thought I wasnt telling the truth. It really hurt me. She also said that I dont say HI to her mom. Which I DO, sometimes I can be really shy. Then when my mom can back from China for 2 weeks, she met Annette. And my mom said Annette was pretty and I was ugly. So yeah.	0
Sometimes if someone is poor or not enough money. People's will have to safe them for their sadness. Everyone can be a hero to them.	1

 when i was in high school (2013), a people from academy pilot selection came and talked me, that I need to take examination test, for pilot academy, so I. Went to the hospital and have a health test, and my health is good, then the next day I came to get the results, then I ask the doctor, that, how much does it cost, and the doctor said its around 40 rupiah, then I only have 20 rupiah, so i said ok, not today but next week i will pick it up, then I left the room, and walked while sad and little tears for not having that much money to pay, and then I saw a woman running towards me, and called my name, then I turned and saw that woman, was a nurse, and she comes with  a white bag plastic and she gives it, then she says, this is the result of your examination, I have paid the fee, you are young, one day you will be a great person, God bless. She said that, and she left, I just kept quiet, and just said many thanks, because, I was nervous, after that I went home and opened a plasticist, then there was a paper that said 'I love, because life is love' then I cried but also happy because, the results were good and I graduated from pilot school. and then, now, as a pilot of Canada Airline, I work for ; Japan, Canada, USA, Mexico, and Brazil. this is, the thing of my life, great nurse, God bless that nurse 	0

Case yall didnt get it, the guy who bought the little girl the cake as a young boy had a cake bought for him. Causing the guy as a grown man to do good deeds and buy the cake for the little girl. The man who bought the little boy the cake for his birthday, had a cake bought for him by the little boy but as a grownup. Moral of the story. Karma is a bitch, but what comes around goes around.	0

I'm gonna crack like nobody's watching and eat like I skipped lunch. Why? Because Red Lobster's Crabfest is back. I'm diving into so much crab, so many ways. Like Crab Lover's Dream with luscious Snow and King crab legs and rich crab alfredo. Or, the Snow Crab bake. Who knew crab go's with everything? Whoever put crab on this salmon, that's who. With flavors like these, I'm almost too excited to eat! Hey, I said almost. Now that it's back, get crackin' while you still can.	2
