For piss-sake, at least provide the calves with adequate shelter, like those plastic calf-hutches. So at least they don't have to languish in the rain and sleep in puddles. Enduring oppressive heat is bad enough.	0
These people will die very painful deaths...karma is so real.	3

I'm NEVER eating chicken again	0
we dont have a choice its our foods. if people dont want this to happen in chickens then stop eating animals. I dont know how is the right way to kill animals. i suggest that they should do a video on how to kill animals the right way if the slaughter house did not follow it. then thats the right time that they should be penalized.	2
Horrific. Karma will get these bitches	2

Listen, abusing animals is wrong, unless you have the intent on eat it. Animals kill other animals and eat them but you don't see no dumb ass vegan being like "NO BEAR! YOU PUT THAT FISH DOWN! IT DID NOTHING TO YOU!" Carnivores eat meat, herbivores eat fruits, vegetables, etc. and omnivores eat a combination. If you don't want to eat meat then don't but you have no right to say others are wrong to eat it. Animals die all the time all over the world. How about you go to Africa and tell the natives that it's wrong for them to be slaughtering that animal and eating it. Also for those vegans that say it's abuse and you're hurting the animal did you know that plants can feel pain too, they just can't express it. Cucumbers feel pain, pineapples know when you're eating it and try to fight back with atoms or some science shit. Someone or something always gets hurts when someone/something consumes energy. So either you STFU and go on with your life or just eat air molecules.	2
how about the bloods. where do they throw it?	0
Abusing and neglecting chickens that are about to be slaughtered? This is the reality of modern farming.	3
I am a meat eater, but after watching many animal slaughter house videos, I sooned believed that every slaughter house is full of sick, abusing people. Im glad the person caught it on camera. Those ignorant sick people should deserve a death penality and thrown in hell.	2
@Parker N.your personal choice of how you want to live life, good day	1
i come back to videos like this to reaffirm why I turned to a vegan diet. Living & letting others live (animals & planet)	3
You have fun with that, I'm going to stick with my juicy burgers and chicken strips : )	1
Fuck,  I feel bad for eating chicken now.	3
And some people still continue to eat meat what a shame	0
+Joanna Dearman In truth there's nothing wrong with eating meat. What is is wrong is how we kill the animals. It is completely inhumane and needs to be stopped.	2
I hate humans sometimes. Including some people in this comment section. What happened that humanity is so rotten? We're terrible, I hope we go extinct. The world would be a better place without us. We're disgusting.	2

To all of who who think this is funny its not these poor innocent animals are sent to die just to feed your ass	2
can we eat our chickens in peace	3
Protein. I hate animal cruelty towards domestic and endangered animals. But chicken, beef and seafood should be a source food of meats. The food pyramid. Yes the way how they are handling them is fucked up. But you have to imagine how people in the world eat chicken and beef. So the process of getting these meats to companies have to be very fast everyday and people need jobs just like this to provide for alot of people.	2
3:01 "Tell Maple Lodge, it's FOWL treatment of chickens has got to stop." Really, you just had to use that inadvertently as a pun.	2

Chickens are actually wise, they do recognize their owners. And also they can remember things for years. I had a 8 years old rooster, SHOCKING for me was, while he a kid of 2-3 months old, he used to sit on 1 branch of a small tree with his mom n brother. When he returned to that place after years after becoming old, HE WENT N SAT ON THAT SAME BRANCH, but he was alone, his new friends went n sat under another tree.	0
I might turn vegetarian now fuck these bastards	2

How can u stand killing thousands of animals and still have mercy , you people are the main reason for this to happen , dont blame maplelodge and your demand we have reached this stage .	2
Plus u dont need to shock the animal and then kill it and normally we dont need thousands of blades exposed to necks automatically killing animals daily You are decieved by capitalism , led by the devils in the world .	2
Everything is wrong and u are complaining about some dust ahhhh .	2
honestly! you people need to just go to your local grocer and buy some chicken nuggets and get over the cruelty bs, do you really think that if they pet the chicken and kiss it on the head before they cut its head off will make a difference. come on you bleeding hearts, the chicken was born to die and feed you just eat of its nutrient flesh already.	2
This is shocking & those involved should be punished	2
I'm trying to give a fuck but I can't. They're just chickens.	2

honestly who gives a fuck? whats the difference between how our ancestors have been butchering animals for thousands and years and now? is it bc we use knives that require electricity instead of a large stick? chicken is a staple food in a lot of cultures. its disrespectful and ignorant AF for you (mostly) white vegans and vegetarians to shame other ethnicities for eating something thats been apart of our culture since forever!	2
Fuck popsicles HA HA WHAT	2

"Mercy for animals" here's the thing I don't want to live life on greens and meat is an important source of minerals, protein and dietary fat. We can prevent animals abuse in so many ways without shutting down slaughter houses. Just stop being like PETA so ignorant. 	2
Never knew they had chicken flavored popsicles	0

THIS IS HORRIBLE THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I BECAME A VEGETARIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	3
I know people are saying "I'm never going to eat meat again!" But we do need meat! Meat has iron and we need that. It's very hard to be a vegetarian. But this is truly cruel! There are others ways to kill animals in peace	2

MONSTERS! HUMANS THEIR SICK! THEY ARE MURDERES! 	0
AHH i couldn't even get through the first 5 minutes. That was horrifying.	3
People are turning away from such farms -- they are turning to farms where animals are treated properly with care & respect from birth .... e.g., HFAC -- "Certified Humane -- Raised& Handled" -- ALL animals are comfortable 24/7 -- they eat healthy, nutritious, natural food, no drugs whatsoever no matter what ridiculous reason, etc. Watching your video of the savage cruelty to and disregard of animals, I am disgusted and so deeply saddened that sociopaths are freely roaming our planet in addition to being employed by you ....	2
Smack heads	2
Thank you Mercy for Animals!Fuck you Maple Lodge and all who support factory farming	2
Fuck you Maple Lodge Farms! You greedy disgusting bastards!	2
Chickens are giving their lives up to end up on our dinner plate, so at the very least they should be treated humanely!	2
Thank you to Mercy for Animals and to CTV/W5 for airing the "for the birds" segment. And thank you to The Toronto Sun for the link to this video. Send it to EVERYONE you know, and do not ever buy a single thing from these sons of bitches again!!!	1
it makes me sick that people could be so cruel and apathetic towards animals period!	2

Thank you Mercy for Animals!	1
Sorry MFA this is so bad I can't even watch it any more.	3
People should support their local farmers markets. Try healthy happy pasture raised eggs, poultry, pigs and beef then you will taste the difference between a sick antibiotic overdosed animal raised in a factory farm. The taste and quality of a happy healthy raised animal compared to a antibiotic fed sickly animals raised in a factory nightmare their entire life is night and day.	0
There really is only one way to be fully humane with regards to animals in this life - and that's to go vegan. Come on, people - the time for a more INCLUSIVE sense of empathy and compassion is well overdue!	1
Couldn't even watch half of the video, what a disgusting company.	2

I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY THE MOST EVIL OF PEOPLE WIND UP TAKING CARE OF OUR PRECIOUS ANIMALS?!!!!! DONT BUY DAIRY!!!!! DONT BUY Coca Cola!!!!	2
God told us to take care of the animals! Someone is going to have to explain to God why he treated these animals badly!	3
What I don't understand is the point of the temperature outside. At one point the person filming holds up a thermometer and it says 101, then he makes a comment that the cow is penned up with no shade, even though that particular shot shows it in the shade. If it's so bad for the cows to be outside, then why do other videos taken at indoor farms say that the cows should be outdoors? It seems like it doesn't matter because the activist groups will complain either way. They should focus on the abuse, like the farmers grabbing the calves and throwing them around, or kicking them. That stuff is never ok and needs to stop and the abusers need to be dealt with	2
Who are the beasts?	1
I seriously hop that the producers of this video relise that this does not happen in every farm. And the way I see it they are just brainwashing people into becoming vegan do not trust these videos!	2
So mote it be.	1
Im not sad and cry	3
May all involved be treated the same. May it come back to them and anyone associated with them! Curse them!	2

And again, there is something very unsettling about a child's sexual organs being viewed as the most important trait to know about them. No one is throwing hair color reveal parties. Or blood type reveal parties. Or even chromosomal typing reveal parties.	3
Focusing so much on the configuration of a baby's external genitals is all it is. This extra focus on that specific quality is part of why there is such weight given to gender and gender roles in society, and is directly tied to the historic disenfranchisement of women, trans people, and anyone else who doesn't neatly fit into society's boxes.	1
@aijun ruan shut the fuck up, also you dont even know what thot means	2
aijun ruan how are suppose to find out the hair color and blood type??? Lol you cant be serious with those comparisons. We didnt know gender until ultrasound existed. You do know there are ppl who do prefer not to know till the day off. Why do ppl think they can control others beliefs? Youre doing exactly what you say you hate!	2
Welp this is 2019	0
Saying that gender is "just their genitals" is idiotic, men and women will act different based on their gender its not some type of social norm you moron	0

People should stop calling them "gender" reveal, gender and sex are soo different, sex is the part and gender is what the child chooses. They should call it sex reveal not gender, they don't know when their gender would change.	2

We take big wins? My name is variah	1
Fyi: The real reason white ppl are so weird about black ppl is because were not sure how to act. Growing up were told about slavery and racism which makes us feel guilty (even though we had nothing to do with it) so when we get around black ppl we act extra nice to them, while constantly thinking: Do they think Im a racist? Do they hate me? This "being nice" comes off as either patronizing or 2 faced. Like they think were just being nice to them so we can screw them over later. The whole thing is so confusing. 	3
RIDICULOUS trailer. Spoils everything.	2

I'm most definitely, maybe not the most multi coloured anti racist emoji that black and white history hasn't ever or never hasn't seen without not looking through somebody else's eyes that don't belong to them if you know what I'm not saying. Mr Towelie is the only thing missing from this movie.	2
Total BS.Racism and plagiarism.Jordan Peele winning the Oscar was as funny as any skit on Key And Peele	2
WHAT the FU** IS THIS  AND WHY is a "black Forrest Gump" RUNNING PAST the black dude at 1:02 ??!	2
THAT'S THE SCARIEST PART:    Seeing a "black Forrest Gump" coming AT YOU AT 70 MPH,  haa haa!  :-P	0
WHAT IS THIS sh**??!   "No, No, No, No, No, No, No, NO, NO, NO, NO...!"   	2
Lmbo, i might laugh OUT LOUD DURING those two sections:  when she keeps saying "NO" AND when "black Forrest Gump" comes at me AT 70 MPH  (i'd LIKE to SEE that "black Forrest Gump" part IN 3-D,  haahaa)!  :-D	2

Oh, come on! You just gave away the whole movie.	2
I am scared	3
It always amuses me how blacks and whites in the U.S. think they own views on prejudice.  I grew up in the bible belt.  Not dark enough to be black.  Not white enough to be white.  No support groups back then.  Where's my wellfare, my white supremacy, my identification with a culture.  Where's my woe is me I'm white or black.  Good riddance, U.S.A. and your nonsense.  Grow up and become a country some day.	3
Started out good  then got ridiculous.  Why he didn't just bolt after seeing those pictures pist me off.	2
Which pictures are you referring to?  If you mean those pictures of Alison Williams with those other folks, the movie would have been over too soon - and without any real 'climax'.	0
this trailer is full of spoilers,	2
Those white supremacists were handled. HA HA HA.	2

Jordan Peele, man, loved him since MadTv and now he's making amazing movies, I'm so pumped	1
why did they have to make it about race?	3
there are so many more less offending and actually philosophocal categories they could've chosen...	3

The racial issue masks the mk-ultra, illuminati theme. Kind of like 'They live'. That's my theory.	0

wow - i have to assume it's not going to be very good if they essentially trim the whole movie down into a 2 and a half minute trailer....	0
The whole point of a trailer is to give a mini-version of the movie, so that us ticket-buyers will want to go out and see the whole thing!	0

I bet this movie will have a secret twist that the black people are the ones that's the bad guys...and the whites are just pawns	0
I love Trance totally wrong	1
I don't know whether I'm supposed to laugh or be scared but damnnnnn. Also for people that don't understand the mind of Peele, it's satire. He doesn't really think white people are bad and anyone who is fueled by this movie is the problem, not the movie itself.	3

dude looks high as hell in this Movie	0
second trailer in a row i watched where somebody hits a deer. this has to stop	2
It actually worked in this movie, because it helps to both portend the future trouble in store for the male lead, and hints at the tragedy in his past.  Remember how those painful childhood memories came flooding back to him, when the deer was hit?	0
this movie is actually trying to take advantage of the racism going around in order to sell tickets. Stupid...	2
I hate racists 	2
I hate discrimination	2
I hate hate f^$*! HATE RACIST	2
I'm so confused wtf	3
That Trailer reminds me of bioshock and The phrase "Would You Kindly"	3
creativity is back in movie making......thank u!!!!!	1
I swear, white people are crazy AF 	0
So places with all-black populations should have the most 'sanity' in them - like no crime or deviant behavior of any kind?  Are you willing to make that statement?	0
Okay....that was fucking scary. A group of white people making sure to have a form of control over what goes on....I hope the bulk of them die for whatever crimes they have brought upon those who were unfortunate enough to end up there. But, then again...there is a twist to be seen in this trailer.	0
they showed half fucking movie jesus	2
I get robbed or shot at around too many black people. That's why I live in a mostly white community & skip the black family reunions in Atlanta.	2
nice. a movie that will divide the world even more.	1
this shit looks so retarded	3
i need to learn this hypnosis shit	2
Wow I'm the bad guy in this one I'm white btw	0
Considering this is from the mind of Jordan Peele, would this be considered a black comedy (no pun intended)?	0
Josh Lyman what happened to you man :(	3
People are ignoring the point of this movie. 	2
Horror plays off people's fears. Jason has the killer stalking in the woods. Freddy is the monster in your dreams. Poltergeist is about old houses that go creak. For some black folk there's a legitimate fear of white suburbia and how it can change a person.	0
That clearly was the point of the movie.  I would think enough people 'got' it, considering how well it did at the box office.	2
Saw the whole movie in the trailer	0
I love the description of this movie. "A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's cursed family estate. verrryy nice. beautiful undertones.	1

racist movie but cool	1
I don't get the plot of this story please explain	3
So this horror thriller is literally about whitewashing black people? Lol. It's Stepford Wives but only for people that're black. It seems so silly that I kind of wanna watch it to laugh the whole time. There's plenty of films that went about gentrification a lot more subtle and more entertaining.	0
Except this movie is not about 'gentrification'.  That terms means "Changing a neighborhood to make it more attractive to wealthy folks"!	2
hell ya.	1
just call it hypnosis aka DMT	1
hahahaghaahhahaha	1
this trailer was weird and funnu	0
the movie should be called is she worth it	1

im literally shakin in fetal position	3
This movie is actually perfect because as a black person that watches horror movies my first response is "you'll never see me in that situation" but my gf is white so now im looking at her parents in orange county like >.> lol 	3
stupid trailer tells almost all the story!!	2
Jordan Peele is known to create some serious looking stuff to be funny the funny thing about this is idk whether to take this as a parody or something serious and how ironic it releases during black history month	0
Fuckof! :p	1
George Zimmerman is hispanic....	0
Sooooo..... this is how BLM see white people???	0
its made by white people btw, its called a social commentary, everyone assumes all racism is dead in all corners of society which is obviously not true, this is just holding a magnifying glass to those more scary people who are still racist and i think everyone can feel how scary it must be if you in the situation shown in the film.	0
Still, could be good if it plays it's cards right. Needs to really try though	0
Interesting concept and idea but probably should have been done	0
based on a true story	1
ooooh heck nah bruh....	2
lmfao please tell me this is a joke	0
THIS LOOKS HILARIOUS!!	1

Pretty sure a buncha white people made this movie LOL. Hella racist, much?	0
That is actually more true of Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever".  Jordan Peele actually has a white wife.	0
I don't get the point of the movie	3
Idc, whoever made this seems to hate mixed race relationships	0
from Jordan peele dude!	1
Is this a modern day twist on auctioning people off? Hypnotizing them and inviting their friends over to bid on his life. I'm very intrigued.	0
I'm black and no doubt if the roles were reversed it would be the most racist movie of 2017!! This isn't funny it's kind of rude to whites	2
i think this was meant to be horror, not comedy	3
It's nice to hear at least one person say it -_-	1
The twist is, at the end they have a kid, and he sticks around to take care of it XD	1
I have a friend who is in this movie	0
I literally laughed thru out the whole trailer	1
That looks trippy	0
Jordan Peele is a fucking genius! Who else can make/write a script about scary white people and make it HORRIFIC!!! Lol	0
white people are really like this too	3
well that legit was the whole movie..	0
this movie looks stupid tbh id rather watch elmo and be more entertained	0
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this has my interest.	0
White People at there finest. Fuck all the Producers of this Movie. Yall are that comfortable to where yall want profit from it? That's not cool at all. And anybody who doesn't like this Fuck You 2 Times with the Megaplier No Cash Option.	2
I think they hypnotized the white girl. shes the bait. After they caught her with the first black guy they said "okay, bitch". Hypnoed her ass to get more free labor.	2

like how they say the name if the film in the trailer	0
this looks terrifying.... people, just stop putting rarcial bullshit in the comments	2
The funny part about this comment section is everyone not noticing Peele is both, black and white. So he has his cake and is eating it too. Bahahahahahaha! Nothing racist about the flick.	0
Demonize White people: Check	2
Victimize Black people: Check	1
Have racists in thread claim it's not racist to Whites despite obvious reality that it is: Check	0
Yep we have ourselves another racist White-bashing, race baiting movie. Now for the White guilt morons and the BLM racists to defend it despite the facts being right there to see.  	2
Let the trolling begin...	1
I like how nobody here has reached the point in commenting why the movie is critically acclaimed to begin with, where it's merit lies is because it is a satire about how friendly neighborhoods and sometimes being too friendly to black people just comes off as a forceful positive that is negative in the end. 	2
Of course, that is to imply that anyone that would look at it from a perspective in which it isn't progressing to something that actually has a reason for it and doesn't even know the dynamics of racial stuff at all or it's systematic basis would even think about rationality.	2
@Aamer Kastoff 	1
Two different races will always bring up racial tensions. It's always been a sensitive area in America. Also keep in mind he and his publicity team will say what they have to get it to sell. 	2
Either way don't surprised if a white person helps him to escape.	0
@Nak Loves Jesus That awkward moment when Jordan Peele, the director, describes Get Out as "a racial horror movie."	0
you're also trolling. the movie isn't racist. The lead villains are just white.  When you have both races in a movie things like this happens.	2
@Aamer Kastoff lol np	1
Wtf did i just watch 	0
White people be crazy.	0
Niggas would be saying: "No... No... No... no no no no no no no" to white girls after watching this flick.	2
This honestly looks really good.	0
....ooookay?!?!?	2
Is this funny?	0
This movie sucks.	2
bet his girl was in on it the WHOLE time.	0
I like the movie, but its not realistic. Im white, if I was trying to take over a black mans body and he found out about it, I wouldnt be smirking like that girl was. Id feel embarassed...also, I can honestly say I cant think of a single time where I wanted to take over anybodys body	3
mihai Inpusket is mmm white ass tasty af	1
That's how they lure brothers in...with that white ass:)))	1
Something is not right with this movie	3
Thats right black people. Be afraid! The white man is gonna get ya.... oh wait black on black violence is far more likely to get you killed... maybe you better move to a white community far more safe!	2
Spoiler alert he dies from his so called "girlfriend" murdering him and she was Luring him into a trap	2
that is a seriously trippy movie.	0
This looks soooo GOOOOD!	1
Well that was strange! This looks like a horror film for black people!lol!	0
Black version of the wicker man? This guy is a good actor though. I've liked him since Johnny English.	0
to every body complaining that white people being depicted "evil" thats not what this movie is about. Its about some crazy ass country folk on a cursed estate. also, i have money on the girlfriend is actually evil by the end.	2
this is going to be a weird experience	0
When I saw the deer fly across the road, I thought an actual monster had thrown is across, kinda dissapointed.	3

Hm, hypnosis and horror..... gonna give it a try.	0
When hypnosis goes wrong	2
I think this movie would be great if race relations weren't as shitty as they currently are.  Right now, this movie is only going to stir the pot of the "White Devil" and Blacks being "victims".  Bad timing.	2
Jordan Peele actually said that this movie was meant to be an 'olive branch', and it's worth noting that he proclaimed his love for 'everyone' at the 2018 Oscars.	1
wow, racist comments on a YouTube page.	2
it's only coming from one demographic 	1
shocking 	0
isn't it?	0
i'd laugh if this was just a social experiment to test the white community's sensitivity.	0
Won't lie, I cringed at this. [Systemic racism intensifies]	3
look at all these butthurt offended people who mist bring up the race. tbh i dont care the movie looks good and sure will shit like a baby in his new fresh diaper. I also like the idea of having another skin colour as main role	0
looks interesting.	0
I can't help but find this movie so outrageous, it's actuallyfunny	0
seems like a KKK movie, i dont know... just thoughts	3
Technically, its not. The KKK hate black ppl. *Spoiler alert* In this movie, the whites dont HATE black ppl. They envy them so much so that they want to take over their bodies. A KKK member would never do that. They enjoy being white	2
Lee Jun not at all, seems like a good film whit comedy.	1
dont u just love when trailer just reveals the ENTIRE movie. thanks trailer...thanks :)	2
"No, I mean do they know Im black, BLACK!"	0
me encant! se ve super diferente a todas las "tpicas"pelculas de terror! ;)	1
ya quiero verla!	3
jordan peele wrote this!!?!? i have to see this now	0
am I the only one that don't understand about this movie is going to be ?? but it's great , makes me curious	0
Don't be racist xD	2
the only agenda of this movie and why it is excepted on the big screen by hollywood is to get African men to stop seeing white women. Yeah they are getting tired of interracial couples and them having family's. I live in Houston TX. My girl friend is navajo. I view her in the same boat as i. She is an Ethnic women, with the same oppressor as i that have raped both of our people and have robed both alike of their identity.  However we get shit from people in public. ugly looks mostly from white men. side comments and all.	2
So a black racist paranormal movie huh?	0
Anyone else besides me suspect that the girlfriend is part of this whole plot? I hate to be the only one who is thinking this.	0
This is creepy as fuck.	0
so scary	0
If this is supposed to be a horror movie, I've lost all hope in the movie industry.	3
it's more of a satire if you don't get scared at things	1
psychological horror film.  more to do with fucked up mental situations than actual jump scares. truly more horrifying if you watch and think about that type of films	3
As a white guy I feel comfortable saying this looks pretty good.	1
the funny thing is being an indian guy i am comfortable watching this movie too hahaaha	1

Chris Newman as a Black guy im thinking. "What the fuck did I just watch"	0
What the fuck kinda shit is this  this is racist against white people	2
usually in movies one race is given lower roles. But with a mix of races in movies which one race is the hero and the other is the villain it's always going be racial arguments.	1
dude I'm black and I ain't think nothing like that.  it's actually good to see whites and blacks in movies together with major roles.	1
I'd say you here it a lot alright : )	1
Nope, 'Oirish.	2

The generalization based on white people comes from the fact that they benefit from their stereotypes, and all white people benefit from a system's white privilege, that ain't a generalization that's just how the dynamic is.	0
Evil as evil does.	1
Let them say what they want, their opinion should mean little or nothing to you.	1
All of you are generalizing white people. imagine if white people were generalizing black people. that would be racist to you right? yes. now stop being racist against white people	2
such fucked up perceptions.  All of you.	2

"Do the Right Thing" had a fairly incendiary climax, that also touched on racial tension, yet it was - and still  is - a highly regarded movie.	0

MUST...WATCH IT....	0
It's written by Jordan Peele, the real thing is probably morecomedy than anything, like Scream, the wickerman, or the happening. This trailer doesnt portrayz the real flow of the actual movie	3
Too many damn people are going political with this shit. It's written by Jordan Peele for Christ's sake. It is clearly not sending out the message that all white people are evil; the mane character is dating a white woman for Christ's sake, it's the parents and they're friends who are the psychos in the movie. And also, how is this movie propaganda for a mixed race relationship. Just because there's one in the movie, doesn't mean that the movie claims that all relationships must be mixed race.	2
I already saw the trailer bc it came before the video	0

Won't be long until the Black Lives Matter movement picks up on this movie and uses it to fuel the flame.	1
do you really wasting your time with "calling out fascists online" wow you must have a pretty boring life	0
Here's a rational explanation: Black lives matter was literally based on the idea of police brutality on murders based on profiling race.	3
Thank you, Sparks, that was a fantastic response. No anger, no name calling, just rational explanation.	1
discrimination on anyones part is wrong but it is vital to realize two key things. your experience is not the whole story, and media spotlight is not political sway. if blm had political sway many of the officers accused of killing unarmed black men would have been jailed before enough evidence could be compiled to even show what the truth is. secondly im sorry youve experienced racism and discrimination at all but just like youve experienced it so have others. you, i am assuming, are white while i am black. we each see a different side of this story that paints a very different picture. yours may be one of angry blacks who have political sway in ways that are comepletely unfair but mine is justt the opposite. what the otheer guy earlier said is key. we do need communication so we can fit these puzzle pieces together and figure out what the problem actually boils down to. while you yourself may not be racist you do have a "racist" viewpoint as do i. by that i mean that you are more sympathetic to the issues of your own race than that of another simply because you yourself understands these issues. i fear that 80% of america is guilty of this no matter their ethnicity but its something that can only be overcome by continued conversation. i hope this helped you understand things from the other side of the fence just a bit more and i wish you well. ps i know there are hella grammatical errors and spelling mistakes but i really dont give a flying fuck about fixing it. hope you any anyone else who reads dont have too much difficulty understanding my point.	2
Yes they are, you are mentioning it right now, everyone is mentioning it. Except the KKK does not have the support of the media. There aren't hundreds of videos made being made to support the KKK. Everyone except the KKK is against the KKK. The KKK has no where near as much political pull like BLM does, nor should they. Any movement that aims to place their race above anyone else should be disbanded, whether it be pro white or black.	2
This movie should do well to distract the public from the rising racial tensions happening as of late...	0
I'm going to take a guess that they've all be lobotomized.	1

@The Zee yea but i bet this will sell a ton of tickets because the media is really running with this lets hate white people narrative.	2
Oh man this shit has been happening. They pretty much have to cast white people as villains in almost everything because, you know, white people are the only ones who are capable of evil. Which is complete shit, if you have a shred of intelligence and pay attention to anything.	2
mk Ultra at its finest :)	1
Plus the mind is a terrible thing to waste.....so let them use it for you. Mk Ultra all the waaay	1
hypnosis. all the blacks and even the controllers (the "parents") themselves there seems to be in a trance. trust me, I know an mk Ultra undertone when I see one ;)	1
is the movie actually trying to connect in any way to MK ultra? I don't know much about the plot outside of what IO see in this trailer.	0
mind fuck	2
A movie about a black mans worst nightmare	3

If I remember correctly, Jordan Peele is a huge horror fan. This should be good.	0
Just another movie to paint black people ac victims and white people as super evil. If you are white and say anything negative about this movie you hate black people.	2
This is trash and fucking propaganda bullshit.	2

if she isn't I'd be suprised	0
And we have the whole movie in one sentence here folks.	2
that guy was a good actor in blackmirror	1
I watched this during the day and got slightly scared.	0
Indeed, the Night is awesome, calm. I do not understand the fear about the Night. Also such Trailer/Movie should be scary in any time of the day, if you are senitive about such. Imagin all the stuff we know already what can happen, things happen every time, every day. That is the most scariest thing ever, beside Humans overally.	0
you racist fuck lol	2
so u mean at night is more scary ! lmao why this association with night ?	0
What the hell is this? Some of it mad me think it was a comedy and the rest was a horror movie. I was so confused about the whole damn thing	3
Oh. My. God.	0
did any one saw "Joker'' of Suiside squad 1:42	0
it does look good and i'm probably gonna watch it to see what its like, its just that the whole "evil racist white people" element makes me uncomfortable. it just paints a bad picture of white Americans.	0
It only paints specifically racists in a bad light. The girlfriend is white and is clearly fine with black people, she seems like one of the heroes of the movie.	3
Damn this looks good	1
+free thinking Seriously,  as a black man, this movie might not be good. Lol	0
love you bro!!!	1
Holy Shit i want to see this	0
go post your comment elsewhere I'm sick of you ppl trolling the internet and falsely pinpointing everything to race TF i cant like dislike or comment on  something anymore these days without it being linked to race ... is race the most import factor of ourlives TF	2
Why everything has to do with race?	3
Are you serious ? Smh 	2
It looks good so I want to see it 	0
Does that clear it up 	0
RRRRRIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTTT wow	0
this strikes me as a comedy, but then also terrifyingly honest	0
@OkamsRazer "sort of people who vote for Trump", so half your country? idiot	2
Stepford Wives was my immediate thought too, it has the potential to be a good re-imagining of that story as long as it steers clear of divisive politics as much as possible. Hopefully not every white person is a bad guy. I do have the feeling the girlfriend is going to be something like the girlfriend from the Wicker Man remake though.	0
i know right	1
well it was written by jordan peele :P	1
This is from Jordan Peele?!  As in "Key & Peele"?  Wow, I knew he was funny and talented but this is a whole new side to him I haven't seen before.  I am looking forward to this!	0
I'm pretty sure its a satire	0
Watch the sketch "Make A Wish" and you'd be surprised at how fucking creepy he can be.	0
RIGHT! I just found that out today!!	0
this actually looks really good!	0
Seems as though they were all hypnotized. His warning is to GET OUT while he can.	2
could someone explain what the fuck was going on? could not understand shit with jump scare music going on and off.	2
@popeye697 thanks for clearing that for me... english is not my first language so I have trouble figuring what they say in their own accents and stuff...	0
Very simple	1
seemed pretty clear what was happening. black people going missing because they were being hypnotized/brainwashed into servitude.	3

Worst Joker In The Trilogy. His look is nothing like the joker he looks like a wall that's been graffitied if Warner brothers made him look better and gave him more screen time but he does not bet the bes joker heath ledger or Joaquin Phoenix or even the original joker from the first film.	2
Its not Joker, but The Joke	0
Joker may not have been 'joker' but it was still an interesting portrayal.. still entertaining.. im not one to compare things that were never meant to be exact.. Heath's was def more mesmerizing for me	0
The worst joker in history, thank god we are not going to see this clown again lmao	2
all that hate doesn't do nobody any good	0
This joker and this film are bad	0
Suicide Squad had a lot of potential. I couldn't help but before I even became a DC fan and watched this I just couldn't not cringe at some of the dialogues and the faces The Joker made. This is a shame for the DCEU.	0
this joker is pure crap!!!!.. margot playing Harley took away the whole movie(perfect pick)...but leto playing the joker makes me wanna barf... it's such a disrespect to the joker character as well as ledger and phoenix	0
Jared Leto couldnt carry a tune to keep his Joker	1
Jared Leto is my favorite joker of all time	1
Have u seen the other jokers?	0
I would pay big bucks for a movie just about joker and Harleys romance, joker just looks so hot in this movie and We really need some more spicy romance scenesssssss	0
What I hate about his character is that he literally has "damaged" tattooed on his forehead, like wtf.	2
you are HORNY.	0
This joker is bad	0
Why do ppl hate on Jared Lettos Joker?	3
Lmfao, call me uneducated but, you cant even use proper punctuation fam lmao. You look stupid asf:	0
I like to reply to a lot of uneducated people I heard he did try to stop the Joker movie, but then I heard that was a lie	0
Just look at him	0
Maybe because of HIS Joker himself. He's all gangster-ish, making those weird expressions on his face, a lot of reasons. Not even gonna lie, but Jared giving his castmates used condoms and anal beads as a "Joker Prank" and trying to stop Warner Bros from making Joaquin Phoenix's Joker just makes people hate him even more.	0
cuz he's acting as the joker is like real elephant crap in front of Heath and Phoenix's performances	3
Jared Leto is the worst Joker in the history	2
agreed...jared was a joke	2
Mox Milton This film doesn't do justice of him being the Joker	2
Worse joker out of the bunch	2
Nice!!!!	1
Respect tho he ain't want no beef that's his girl	2
Best joker  ever and he's Harley best duo ever man they smash that movie can't wait too see them again but both nor others nobody is going too make the movie better than them!!!!	1

Kills him.	2
This is my joker	1
I like to reply to a lot of uneducated people 	0
I was comparing him to Jared Letos joker for one.	1
Two, Joker has never been dark as you say. He scares you on a weird psychological level. Never in Jokers run has his appearance been scary, he always wears the trademark green and purple color way. 	0
In most of Jokers runs he is feared by his actions and intellect and the name he made for himself. (Which you see Amanda Waller state here)	0
The most scary thing about him is his pale face and red makeup.	0
Now the tattoos and grils were definitely there to modernize him, I dont mind it much. 	1
Again more of a joker than Jared was.	0
@Cloutless Gaming WTF LOL?!?! Im so sorry omg omg hold on. I appreciate your opinion with all due respect, but I can't help but say, this is not the accurate Joker. He's not supposed to have some sort of gold everywhere, grills, tattoos..he doesn't even have his signature smile. He's not as dark and scary as Heath's Joker, or even relatable. But opinions are opinions...I just had to scream this.	3
Sir Dankleberry 	1
Hes way more accurate. Joker has never been a weird, depressed, antisocial, introvert.	1
This joker is actually a mobster, dangerous (already killed Jason Todd), a true villain, joker was never an antihero.	1
Its good to acknowledge that you have terrible taste.	0
I love the joker	1

I don't no why people don't like him? I mean he made joker sexy	1
If you found that sexy then I think you need help.	1
Poor acting skills, bad writing, bad appearance...the only reason why people like him are probably because he's attractive. That's it. Most of them never actually look into the REAL joker.	2

Although it wasn't the best joker, there were moments that were likeable and I think Jared Leto did a great job creating a new and unique characteristic to someone who can have a lot of layers. Unfortunately, it wasn't something that everyone really accepted. But I like how he made the Joker twisted and cocky, a huge departure from the maniacal part of the character.	1
Ledger is better fuck	3
What is the name of movie	3
Jared leto is only good at being an emo fuck. Try being a man lol, thats what this role lacked. As fucked a joker was, he was a man. Can't cast a woman to do a man's job.	0

Dude, Jared Leto is fine, the writing for him is like the one thing they completely screwed up. Like, how DO you deliver the lines he had to say? Is everyone suddenly a Hollywood actor and know acting?	3

Jared was awful.. his facial structure, his voice, his laugh, his makeup, and his arc is just terrible. As much as I love Heath and Joaquin. It still isn't Arkham joker. Troy baker or some underated actor could deliver a great comic book joker that we're all waiting for.	3
Even the guy with the beard is sitting there finding Leto's joker cringey AF 	0

I just realised at 1:07 at the background Joker is killing a guy with a bat	0

Incredibly dumb, annoying and hilarious Joker	1
I like this movie because you see the softer parts of the relationship they have. Something else I have noticed that she is a masochist which is why she loves being with him. You could say he hurts her in all the right ways. I can also tell that she is the "glue" that holds him together. It is a messed up relationship? YES very much so but to each there own. I also noticed that the main reason why joker killed that guy is because he called her a B word. The need to be careful to with how you treat how you talk about the queen of Gotham.	1
I would like to say worst joker ever	1
I would like to beat her ass	2
U wanna know how I got this girl?	1
Eyyyyyyyyy thats Purple Lamborghini in the background! ;)	1
The Batman got me, locked me up, then this doctor came to me crazier than ever. I said to her "y so serious?" She smiled and flirted with me. I tricked her to help me escape. Then I betrayed her and tied her down. "Y so serious?" I wanted to hurt her. Very. Very. Bad	3

I think that Jared Leto when they were in the club actually proved he loved her. He said she was the itch in his crotch, AND he had also gotten upset that Monster T was hitting on her. He was crazy upset.	0
I still dont understand what Joker was trying to do with Harley and Common like why did he shoot him when he said no to taking Harley when he insisted on giving her to Common?	3

what you dont like me fine then dont waste my time	0
Jared Leto's joker cares about Harley Quinn, cause not only she fell in love with him - The joker did too, he was just scared of her cleaver and good mind, so he made her from a doctor to a criminal. John Doe ( The joker) created a sexy monster of his own.	1
I wanna beeeef	2
God help anyone who disrespect the queen.	2

se screen joker your the best	1

HUNKA HUNKA 	1
XD gets me every time	3
I understand why people hated this portrayal. However, as a fan of both the DC comics and this movie, I actually enjoyed the change in their relationship to a Bonnie/Clyde esque relationship. It's a different spin and something new than the same old storyline arcs. That's the one thing I've always took issues with involving the comics with Joker and Harley. The storylines were usually the same. Joker executes his plans to wreak chaos and fight with Batman, Harley backs him up, Joker tries to kill Harley or abuses her, etc. That's why I liked the switch up in Harley going from villain to anti-hero in more recent adaptations. It gets a little repetitive when the same thing happens each time.	1
So why did he kill him?	3
Yikes. I bet he's cute without green hair.	0
Worst Joker ever!!!.	2
Best joker ever	1
God this is a fucking joke. Harley was fine, surprised I liked her but joker, Jesus Christ he was an insult. This nigga be using his hands and snarling his teeth stupidly for no reason. Oh I'm so hot. Say blah blah blah to sound crazy and weird. Fucking pathetic. All this movie did was give girls a stupid dream fantasy joker to see on the screen. 	2
