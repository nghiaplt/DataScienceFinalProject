I just got back from an unforgettable seven day vacation; I miss you Hawaii and all the great memories you have given me and our family. Mahalo and God bless this paradise island.	1
@Super Saint Hawaii has many activities to take advantage of. Some are free and many are costly. The zoo was beautiful and FREE! I enjoyed zip lining in the rain forest and parasailing at Kona. Go to Groupon for better pricing. If relaxation is what you are looking for, many of the beaches like the Black Sand Beach will satisfy with the most jaw dropping sunrises and sunsets. Hapuna beach is beautiful too! The Tsunami museum in Hilo is only $8 adults and $4 kids. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is $25 per vehicle and open 24/7.  There is a beautiful view of the volcanoes and crater from the Volcanoe house. You don't have to eat at the restaurants but you can get a great view from there and they have a nice lounging area. The Big Island is so amazingly beautiful, but it is very hot and humid right now and it can rain at any time. Just be prepared! We were rained out for a couple of days. The scenic drives made the travel time short - minimal to no traffic. Food can be very costly so plan ahead. Shaka restaurant in Punalu'u has the best Moko Loco and other food items. You get a ton of food and the price is good for the quality and amount. Enjoy your time! Mahalo 	1

This is seriously amazing! Had I been given another life, I would have remained happy without any achievement,any victory, appreciation or acceptance. I would have started things  being happy, not to be happy. But hey! Can do that in this life as well! Happiness is a choice, not a destination. Be happy, Be sad. There is and will always be only one life!	1

Life goes on. Never forget that. Things seem bleak and painful and like the end of the world but your standing and breathing and thats a good thing. Life the life you have nothing will get in your way if you keep looking up to blue skys, yeah theres gonna be clouds. But thats like life. We all want blue skys and go back to the past where things seemed perfect but I can promise you. It gets perfect if you keep moving forward. One step at a time. You can do it I believe in you. From the bottom of my heart. Now go and live life.	1

VERY NICE!!!!	1
I don't mind the commercials - some are really entertaining even. But please don't play them in the middle of an on-going song. sometimes they come on and there's only 30 sec left of the song when it is interrupted. Really?!?!?!?!?	2
just add ads block plus extension into your chrome, you're never have to worry about youtube ads again	2

Listening to this after watching Boy in striped pajamas 	3
That sounds good, especially since I'm learning about World War II in class. I'll check it out!	1
Lovely	1
Right, I know that. It's about two boys; one a concentration camp commander's son the other the son of a Jewish prisoner during the Second World War. While it's not as humorous as the book it's based on (from John Boyne, if you're wondering) it's still a great movie.	2
Anna Mozatee sorry to interrupt but that movie was about war.	2
Well, nothing is wrong with me, actually. Why do you ask?	2
Very nice!	1

I completely forgot what it was called and have just this minute rediscovered it.

Not only are all these animals smart, emotional like people, innocent and so much more fun and rewarding to care for than to eat...but countless peer reviewed medical and nutritional studies have concluded meat and dairy is not healthy for humans.   The president of the US College of Cardiology Dr. Kim Williams is vegan.   He says a vegan improved his health and reduced his bad cholesterol (LDL) as well as his blood pressure.   Studies conclude vegans live longer than people whom consume meat and dairy with less heart disease, strokes, various kinds of cancer and bone fractures to name just a few.	3
Many global elite athletes are vegan too.   ie. Super strong Patrik Baboumian whom has won countless global weightlifting awards and is Germany's strongest man is vegan and he is huge.   Serena Williams whom is clearly in stellar health, is the top female tennis player globally is vegan, actually she says largely raw food vegan.   She also says in interviews that her vegan diet has improved her stamina  and mental focus.   I work in business and marketing, I always check facts verses marketing 'stories, spin..' not based on creditable research.   It is the meat and dairy industry continuing to perpetuate that meat and dairy are healthy but they are not, based on credible studies and population studies.    	1
There are countless delicious and nutritious vegan recipes online for people to get ideas.    Dr. Caldwell Esselsyn another top US cardiologist is vegan and he made the movie along with others called Forks Over Knives.    People can watch it on youtube wow, you will never heart disease causing meat again after watching it.	1

How much money we spent on toys of war by now we could have 'Replicators', machine to produce meat and other food and there are billions of planets I bet lots of those are Earth like so we could relocate surplus of animals there instead of killing it and relocate our self out in other planets to prevent overpopulation on Earth, Yeah! I know some of you will say how I have wild imagination but remember Star Trek and communicators prelude to cell phones we have today, matter of fact Star Trek communicators look primitive when you compare to I phones and Android phones today, so let quit wasting money and knowledge on stupidity and start doing something for good of all of us people and animals and plants as well.	3

'If we could live happy and healthy lives without harming others... why wouldn't we?' Good question, probably has something to do with not worrying where your next meal is coming from and possibly from not worrying about becoming someone else's meal.	1

WOW! Thank you Edgars Mission for creating such a beautiful happy Vegan world!	1
Happy and healthy lives are boring. Danger and adventure require trading happiness and health, and that's what many people prefer.	1
If this doesn't put a smile in your heart, you must not have one.	1
@Tm Phanlc no mt bt ci ny ln coi :*	1

So all of these animals are pretty much being raised for food.. kinda takes the cute out of it. 	1
No, this is a sanctuary! 'Edgar's Mission is currently providing life-long care to over 150 animals who have been neglected, abused and discarded by farming industries.'	2
This is a great video.	1
Il paradiso? Esiste!	2
#animali,  #animalia	1
This is beyond words. Almost surreal. Makes me wanna commit suicide living in a world where we slaughter daily innocent beings like cows, pigs and goats. We humans are the devil and animals are the innocent souls that we torment.	3
OMFG i hate these asswipes that come and comment dumb shit on positive videos just cause they clearly have no fucking life and feel the need to get attention, like just grow the fuck up and start using some logic. I'm talking bout you Venom Snake, get educated.	2
mmmmmmmhhh those lambs will make good food in a few years	1
Alexander Hellene i dont think she is now go away	2

Target practice	2
Love this!	1
Paradise :)	1
And we can, so we do 1:40. Vegan that is. You people are as awesome as those animals, and that's a lot of awesomeness.	1
The title doesn't lie. :D	1
This could possibly the best video I have ever seen!!  I didn't think there was anything cuter than baby goats and pigs, but baby anything in little coats just takes the cake.	1
Its 2020 now and this is cheating me up	2

Who else watching this because there doing their homework and really stressed?	2
Smiles for me, Finally! 	1
Thank you.	1
Whoever you are, wherever you are, I hope you have a wonderful morning/day/ night.  If youre doing homework, work or anything else boring, just remember to smile and think about why youre doing what youre doing. Example: school will help you get an amazing job as long as you work hard  sometimes, bravery means laying down your life for something greater or even having the courage to live another day. If your at rock bottom, remember the only way left to go is up and you cant be brave without being scared. Happy day! 	0

'solutions found' this music saved me $$.. I spent a week listening to this during..  a 1 hour commute. one unsuspecting day i ran into an officer who alarmed me suddenly, asked me to display my ride. i had to pull the earplugs with this song off... Since I dont have my ticket for the bus, $$$$ fine.. this music made me so positive, i was upset annoyed, but then I just suddenly KNEW what to do. While he has my ID, and is writing his ticket to give to unwilling me... I went for the ticket booth, and bought myself a ride ticket!! 'Here, i have my ticket!' i say.. he still did not finish writing the ticket, and now was pretty upset that I did that. But, I could not help it, the music helped me with a solution and I just went for it!! thanks to the positive vibe, helps us to be smarter!	0

I had to find some music to make me happy. I was depressed about missing Japan and I couldn't help myself crying. What I think that made me cry about it was the time I was at the top of Tokyo Tower with my dad and little bro. The rest went to a temple tour. It was complete and I almost cried, but I wiped it off quickly or held my tears. After the entire summer 2019, I still think about Japan, but it makes me sad about it. At home one day, I expressed how I felt about Japan and my dad supported me. After the talk, I decide to listen to this. That's why I found this video.	3
My birthday is on the 8th august too	1

I actually have repulsive depression and I literally typed happy music and I got here ...	3
@Muffers 1 Why are you talking like I am depressed?	3
I never said there's a cure for depression, I just said music won't cure it. I actually had depression. Was diagnosed, didn't want help, tried to kill my self, failed, finally accepted help. It's been a lot better after talking with a psychiatrist. But honestly you might have a point saying 'it always seems to come back'. I never really thought about it that way. Sometimes my day is ruined just because I think of past mistakes or events. I thought I was just being weak or overdramatic, but maybe not.	3
Emil  nope it wont	2
Music isn't going to cure your depression though	3
This song helps me get through watching two little girls all day almost every day (they are crazy but this puts them in a good mood and sometimes puts them a sleep)	1

Its a bright Sunday morning, the flowers are on the grass and trees. The light from the sun is shining through your blinds. You give a sigh of relief that you are in your summer holidays, and that theres no school/work tomorrow. You go and get a lovely breakfast, and throw a toy for your pet dog. Then you go and get ready for the day. Once your dressed and cleaned up, you step outside your house and sit on your sun bed, with your favourite book in your hands. There are children playing in the garden across from yours. They are so happy. You smile to yourself and read. Afterward, you make yourself some lunch, and you and your dog head off to the park. There are many people in this park. Young and old. Children and elderly. You can smell the fresh grass, while the sun is beaming on your face. Your dog is thoroughly enjoying the walk, and so are you. You cant wait to meet your sister and her children for the picnic! Speaking of that, here they are! They come with a basket wrapped in a blanket. You say hello to eachother and your sister lays out the food on the blanket. They food is lovely, and you and your sister chat while her kids and the dog plays. After a long while of playing, walking, singing, chatting and having a lot of fun, you all head off for dinner. You go to our favourite restaurant, and get a table for outside, so the dog can be near you and the sun is out. You get your favourite food! It was very tasty, but now its time to head home. You come to your estate, the children are now inside, but the happy vibes and the flowers on the trees and grass. There is still no school/work tomorrow. The sun is still shining. You step inside with your dog. What a lovely day. And Ill do it all over again tomorrow! You say to yourself and your dog. Your dog barks and you laugh. Everyone was happy. Your dog was happy. Your sister was happy. Your niece and nephew were happy. Those children were happy...	1
You are happy.	1
how long did it take for you to write this haha ? so inspirational hope you and everyone has a great day	1

I feel awesome	1
I really need this.  Even after my own online best friend is being a ass.  And him lying to me so much.  Idk if I can handle talking to him, nor, continue being his friend..be seriously didnt believe me that I was crying my balls off.  And going off, being high.  Like, are you kidding me.  He seriously doesnt believe me that I was crying while messaging him.  I had to leave my online game I play with him.  Cause I cant stand texting him or bother seeing him on..I just need a breath to bring some happiness in me.  I shouldnt let him get to me.  I only need to be concern about me and my mood.	3
Drop him honey. Some people aren't worth wasting time with. If your friend isn't supportive replace him with someone who is.	2
if someone share his sadness we don't have right to push him down if you don't respect feelings of someone else ... keep it for you next time... everybody feel bad sometime.... maybe one day it would be you.	1
This made me happy after what logans vlog made me think about him	1
Mikesityzx Maybe it's time to walk away. Lies etc are not part of a wholesome relationship especially if causing so much distress.	3
U have just to forgot him know life is too short to cry for someone like this	3
no one is really interested in your teenage style angst, there are some very real problems in the world, do try and get things in proportion please.	2
It is really happy music :)	1

Thank you so much for presenting such beautiful music. At the end of the day when activity is wrapped up I have gotten into the habit of searching for soothing music. It creates an aura of peace that banishes the stress and worry for a bit of time. I let it play in the background as I read or sleep. Thank you again.	1

I was listening to this song while  my 6 years old son was sleeping. I was reading some of the comments when my son woke up crying. He told me that by listening to this song made him remembered the awesome day we had together, that by listening to it he felt sad and happy at the same time because the day was gone,  and i just could hold to cry a little seeing how my son could identify his feeling through your music. It was awesome	3

I left a comment on one of your songs and it goes for all you have.  But I used the word simple. I mean clean clear easy to hear.  In no way do I think your work is simple basic or easy.  Hugs sweet.  I want you to understand the magnitude of how your music influences soul.	1
Very good i was bored then i feel to relax and mind went to peace very good music.:)	1
Some friendly advice from the Netherlands, go sit outside in the garden. Take some deep breaths and close your eyes for a second to listen to this peace going through your body just a few second enjoy that feeling of peace you have around you and if you are comfortable open your eyes and look up to the stars. Just to see how bright they are shining for you and just watch a little bit more and a little bit closer and see how all the stars come together at one place to give you all the love, all the energy, all the light and all the peace they what you needed. Now you've tasted this inner rest, go to sleep with a feeling you are blessed to day and knowing tomorrow will be a new day with new love, new light and new energy you needed for this day. Enjoy your day and love the people around you. If yo have been taking this advice I will promise you that you will enjoy every little thing in life, just like all these little stars in this bright sky	1

This song is beautiful, and Rebecca, totally agreed. Thought of suicide, never came close to doing it cuz I knew there was so much more, I can overcome struggles	3
Ute Jene oh lord only 10 years old. You have youre entire life ahead my love. Pre teen and teenage years go so fast. They are full of anxiety, the unknown, peer pressure and discovery. Everything at that age seems like the end of the world (Ive been there) but I promise you it will pass. There is life beyond school. Find what you love and go for it with all youre heart. What other people think is not important. Make yourself happy and try to make others happy and the world will seem like a nicer place. Please dont give up.	1

Without rain sounds or running water. That makes kids go to the bathroom more often while trying to sleep. I like the music with nature sounds but the best to me is the piano.	0

wonderful music	1
I am Mrs.Chong Won Kwak & today is December 23,2019. These beautiful places, resources of life including music like these gentle & loving should be enjoyed and shared by all, but should not be abused, used for evil and hurting. But then there is ugliness in world and some people cannot and never enjoy and experience. It is too much sadness, suffering, etc. How can certain people enjoy? Helping, serving, receiving together is happiness, not anything else. I cannot play music professionally even though I learned and enjoyed the experience of instrument and music with others. It was a good memory, too. Some do not get that experience, but it is not necessary. Having plenty, not being blocked of needs & healthy enjoyment and love with others is necessary. I did not and do not want to experience everything.	1
Thanks for helping people survive in even when they are depressed!!!	1
One day ur hard work will be paid off...one day u'll get all d mental peace that u deserve... One day u'll be so much blessed.... One day.... Insah Allah....one day	1

Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.	1
