I just got back from an unforgettable seven day vacation; I miss you Hawaii and all the great memories you have given me and our family. Mahalo and God bless this paradise island.	1	
@Super Saint Hawaii has many activities to take advantage of. Some are free and many are costly. The zoo was beautiful and FREE! I enjoyed zip lining in the rain forest and parasailing at Kona. Go to Groupon for better pricing. If relaxation is what you are looking for, many of the beaches like the Black Sand Beach will satisfy with the most jaw dropping sunrises and sunsets. Hapuna beach is beautiful too! The Tsunami museum in Hilo is only $8 adults and $4 kids. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is $25 per vehicle and open 24/7.  There is a beautiful view of the volcanoes and crater from the Volcanoe house. You don't have to eat at the restaurants but you can get a great view from there and they have a nice lounging area. The Big Island is so amazingly beautiful, but it is very hot and humid right now and it can rain at any time. Just be prepared! We were rained out for a couple of days. The scenic drives made the travel time short - minimal to no traffic. Food can be very costly so plan ahead. Shaka restaurant in Punalu'u has the best Moko Loco and other food items. You get a ton of food and the price is good for the quality and amount. Enjoy your time! Mahalo 	1	
Hawaii is amazing!! Went there last summer truly amazing 	1

I am 100% European & do love Hawaiian music, but this doesn't sound very traditional to me @ all. Not the Hawaiian/Polynesian style that i enjoy. For me, it must be fully traditional. Sorry guys, no offence. Just sayin.	3	
FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO THE VIDEO! Got the same freaking add 4 TIMES IN A ROW! Too many adds today, its annoying as carrot...	2

This is seriously amazing! Had I been given another life, I would have remained happy without any achievement,any victory, appreciation or acceptance. I would have started things  being happy, not to be happy. But hey! Can do that in this life as well! Happiness is a choice, not a destination. Be happy, Be sad. There is and will always be only one life!	1

Life goes on. Never forget that. Things seem bleak and painful and like the end of the world but your standing and breathing and thats a good thing. Life the life you have nothing will get in your way if you keep looking up to blue skys, yeah theres gonna be clouds. But thats like life. We all want blue skys and go back to the past where things seemed perfect but I can promise you. It gets perfect if you keep moving forward. One step at a time. You can do it I believe in you. From the bottom of my heart. Now go and live life.	0
