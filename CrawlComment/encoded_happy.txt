I played this while playing getting over it with bennett foddy
Aku suka
This music give me an erection
this is spent coding c++ = ))
This is my favorite music to murder to
Im here after Jo Koy
This is great!
                  
Sounds like the first 15 second introduction of every YouTube cooking video. 
How can be
Holy shit this is hilariously accurate. lol
@Si Hopebgood soooo i start my day with lemon water, it's soooo good and hydrating.......
Mmm! Especially vegan ones that start every sentence with "So..."
You can torture me with this
Serving as background music for every cute cat and dog video ever
Would love to have the sheet music for this, beautiful.
Is this available for download? iTunes?
Makes me think of one of those Spiderman and Elsa videos
35:01 I love that one
Could you please list the Name and Artist of the songs? Thank you! Very well done video/music. Perfect for relaxing!
I will play this in my new Ford Mustang while ripping around the coastline.
Weird flex but ok Micheal Jackson
good (*^^*)thankyou!!
I just got back from an unforgettable seven day vacation; I miss you Hawaii and all the great memories you have given me and our family. Mahalo and God bless this paradise island.
@Super Saint Hawaii has many activities to take advantage of. Some are free and many are costly. The zoo was beautiful and FREE! I enjoyed zip lining in the rain forest and parasailing at Kona. Go to Groupon for better pricing. If relaxation is what you are looking for, many of the beaches like the Black Sand Beach will satisfy with the most jaw dropping sunrises and sunsets. Hapuna beach is beautiful too! The Tsunami museum in Hilo is only $8 adults and $4 kids. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is $25 per vehicle and open 24/7.  There is a beautiful view of the volcanoes and crater from the Volcanoe house. You don't have to eat at the restaurants but you can get a great view from there and they have a nice lounging area. The Big Island is so amazingly beautiful, but it is very hot and humid right now and it can rain at any time. Just be prepared! We were rained out for a couple of days. The scenic drives made the travel time short - minimal to no traffic. Food can be very costly so plan ahead. Shaka restaurant in Punalu'u has the best Moko Loco and other food items. You get a ton of food and the price is good for the quality and amount. Enjoy your time! Mahalo 
Hawaii is amazing!! Went there last summer truly amazing 
E Z imma go to Hawaii Next week And I wonder if its fun over there.
Ill be there one day... one day
First song; who's whistling?  Soulful effort.
f you want to start day happy  verry good
Awesome :))
Good song
See white woman on the cover, thumbs down
And I love banjo too 
Is so  relaxing I love it 
Track list? whats the name of the first song?
My parrot gets so excited when i put this on.....he was hopping and swinging and flapping about.........actually so was i.
I am 100% European & do love Hawaiian music, but this doesn't sound very traditional to me @ all. Not the Hawaiian/Polynesian style that i enjoy. For me, it must be fully traditional. Sorry guys, no offence. Just sayin.
Name of first track please
Wht's the music playing 04:22?Who knows?
Can someone tell the chords? Please
FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO THE VIDEO! Got the same freaking add 4 TIMES IN A ROW! Too many adds today, its annoying as carrot...
love it i put it on when i do homework
This is seriously amazing! Had I been given another life, I would have remained happy without any achievement,any victory, appreciation or acceptance. I would have started things  being happy, not to be happy. But hey! Can do that in this life as well! Happiness is a choice, not a destination. Be happy, Be sad. There is and will always be only one life!
1:01:47
Playlist gniale, mais un peu beaucoup rptitive  la fin. (Les chansons sont passes en boucle)

Life goes on. Never forget that. Things seem bleak and painful and like the end of the world but your standing and breathing and thats a good thing. Life the life you have nothing will get in your way if you keep looking up to blue skys, yeah theres gonna be clouds. But thats like life. We all want blue skys and go back to the past where things seemed perfect but I can promise you. It gets perfect if you keep moving forward. One step at a time. You can do it I believe in you. From the bottom of my heart. Now go and live life.
TheTedHead thank you so much! God bless you this made me feel so much better

I enjoy these tunes I find them so relaxing and I like the different melodies and rhythms but I find the tracks very short as Im getting into the track I find it ending if whoever created this playlist could make all the tracks longer at least 4 mins for each track I would say.
i love your relaxing music
These are my favorite tunes. I listen to them when I am working to keep me happy!! I wish I could make music with my ukulele as good as these are!!!
I listen to this almost everyday with my friends! It makes me feel so happy!

4:18 - my favorite part
Love This 
second song, but only the second. How and where can i find it?
can anyone tell me about the title of first track ? i just want to search for the track.
When I need to get away from reality and go somewhere where no one can tell me no, where I'm not bothered I turn on the radio or I turn on music on YouTube and I go far away to an island that I only know about where everything is possible 
At one point the music got slow and it made me very depressed and upset it was unpleasant
Then it got happy again*
when your watching a scary video so you mute that video and turn on this it really work
I watched something so scary and I need this
this music makes me so happy cheerful.thank you
im still not happy i still want to die
love the music, thank you so much
G'morning!!!, This is my "get into my HAPPY ZONE" music. Thank You!
I listen to this while reading stuff about the paranormal online
love it make me happy always
Very nice )
this is awesome to listen to well i play my games like Minecraft to have this playing in the backround thanks!
I was curious what they meant by happy music, and i listened, and yea, that's what it is. But it's also a cell phone commercial soundtrack.
VERY NICE!!!!
I don't mind the commercials - some are really entertaining even. But please don't play them in the middle of an on-going song. sometimes they come on and there's only 30 sec left of the song when it is interrupted. Really?!?!?!?!?
just add ads block plus extension into your chrome, you're never have to worry about youtube ads again
Thank you for this lovely music. I really needed it on this rainy gray day in England :)
Patty Pereira Taylor z

Can someone tell me the chords to this? I want to play a ukulele fingerstyle cover of this.
Joelle Small Just kidding kkkkk but, If you don't know a major andar a Minor note, learn It first, then you can start playing
Oh, um, thank you? I still don'y understand.

Listening to this after watching Boy in striped pajamas 
That sounds good, especially since I'm learning about World War II in class. I'll check it out!
Lovely
Right, I know that. It's about two boys; one a concentration camp commander's son the other the son of a Jewish prisoner during the Second World War. While it's not as humorous as the book it's based on (from John Boyne, if you're wondering) it's still a great movie.
Anna Mozatee sorry to interrupt but that movie was about war.
Well, nothing is wrong with me, actually. Why do you ask?
Very nice!
sound good !

Is it non copy right Music ?
Very nice music for studying so far.  Hopefully, there are no vocals as it can be distracting while reading.
Samoan music
NO <<SO FAR>> YES 100%
Very true.
These images are the best gift for me this Christmas. Congratulations; people capable of feeling thrue compassion, are the people who will change the world!!!

I grew up on a small farm. Went to college on egg and milk money. Raised New Hampshire Reds. Kept  a crippled chick, Baby for 13 yrs. Chickens are wonderful it's just that people do not seem to understand that animals have feelings, are funny, etc. Thank you so much for bringing back memories-had a pygmy goat years later-Oh the JOY!! THANK YOU.
I came to watch this after watching a short film that I thought was cute and all, but no it's a stalker following a girl everywhere. I had a heart attack!!!!!!
My,Oh! My, what wonderful little characters they all are. It so heart-warming to see them having so much fun,when their fate could have been so much worse.Millions of bouquets to all at Edgar's Mission. Watching this has made  my day,and,it goes into my favourites,along with everything else Edgar's mission uploads.
Sup my ass
I had a nightmare thanks I really appreciate it
I wish we could
This video was released the week my cheating boyfriend dumped me, and I watched it endlessly just to help me get out of bed. It reminded me that there was goodness in the world. I completely forgot what it was called and have just this minute rediscovered it. I don't just want to thank you for the work you do, but for keeping me going when all I wanted to do was lie in bed until I died. Still alive, people! Still alive! xxxxxxxxxxx
Too cute to handle
48 dislikes

When you're done watching walking dead season 7 episode 1 and need happinesss
so cute
This is why I'm glad I don't eat goat or rabbit and the only pork I eat is bacon
24 people are crap heads
Needed a happy fix and got it!
I feel bad for eating bacon
I agree. This is why we have veggies. But unfortunately we need protein. I love baby pigs but people don't see that there not just food. They feel the same pain, stress, and feelings like we do.
aww im so happy
This video made me hungry O.o
You're trying to make me happy? Challenge excepted.
The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
And a dark wind blows 
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn 
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death 
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
came here before looking up who Charlie Charlie was..Thanks! This was adorable! Love the goats, pigs, and bunnies! 
I was watching something so sad and this has brightened up my life........I'm tearing up
at 1:44 is a dog in a red sweater at the base of the tree. this looks exactly like our tina! she lived t be 17 years old!
I downloaded a game that is about hacking and a unknown cellphone number just called me, its fucking midnight. The first video i see on my feed is "dead by daylight" now I'm legitimately fucking scared and now im here
this helps a little
if u are reading look back at the 2nd word then it is the best person in the world
I'm here cause I just a mailbox with my golf cart and I'm still crying only God can help me rn
good afternoon!
I am in love with the music at 0:36 can you tell me what the song is called so I can listen to it???

I was totally like omg this is gonna be lame, but I found myself with tears of joy at the end and not even knowing it! Anyone else.. Am I just weird...? Okay...
I really want to donate some money to them but I can't:(
A bit too awesome. Especially the goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits!
Not only are all these animals smart, emotional like people, innocent and so much more fun and rewarding to care for than to eat...but countless peer reviewed medical and nutritional studies have concluded meat and dairy is not healthy for humans.   The president of the US College of Cardiology Dr. Kim Williams is vegan.   He says a vegan improved his health and reduced his bad cholesterol (LDL) as well as his blood pressure.   Studies conclude vegans live longer than people whom consume meat and dairy with less heart disease, strokes, various kinds of cancer and bone fractures to name just a few.
Many global elite athletes are vegan too.   ie. Super strong Patrik Baboumian whom has won countless global weightlifting awards and is Germany's strongest man is vegan and he is huge.   Serena Williams whom is clearly in stellar health, is the top female tennis player globally is vegan, actually she says largely raw food vegan.   She also says in interviews that her vegan diet has improved her stamina  and mental focus.   I work in business and marketing, I always check facts verses marketing "stories, spin.." not based on creditable research.   It is the meat and dairy industry continuing to perpetuate that meat and dairy are healthy but they are not, based on credible studies and population studies.    
There are countless delicious and nutritious vegan recipes online for people to get ideas.    Dr. Caldwell Esselsyn another top US cardiologist is vegan and he made the movie along with others called Forks Over Knives.    People can watch it on youtube wow, you will never heart disease causing meat again after watching it.
I hit the read more button and said no
EVERYTHING  IS SO CUTE  
And then they ate them up
where is soda pop??
Needs more bunny footage.
Sooo Nice!
Here after watching @Mr. Nightmare videos for a couple hours in the dark... Why did I do that...
ahhh! that's better
Thanks, it's pretty late, and I just watched Obey the Walrus.
im so happy to have seen this
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
THE CUTEST AND WONDERFUL VIDEO MADE MY DAY. NOW I WATCG WATCH IT EVERY DAU DAY.
NEVER eating meat again
Can't stop watching this! What is the title of background music? :)
So nice...this is so motivating me to go volunteer for a local foster home near by. IMA DO IT!
I want to live there :(
omg i wanna cry !! i love them all :D
would love to be there, hug them, feed them <3
que vdeo tan emocionante
muchas gracias !
How much money we spent on toys of war by now we could have "Replicators", machine to produce meat and other food and there are billions of planets I bet lots of those are Earth like so we could relocate surplus of animals there instead of killing it and relocate our self out in other planets to prevent overpopulation on Earth, Yeah! I know some of you will say how I have wild imagination but remember Star Trek and communicators prelude to cell phones we have today, matter of fact Star Trek communicators look primitive when you compare to I phones and Android phones today, so let quit wasting money and knowledge on stupidity and start doing something for good of all of us people and animals and plants as well.
Muita fofurice reunida 
Como eu AMO ... 
most awesome..
This always makes me feel better. I want the pigs in the basket.
Now I'm HAPPY too! :-D
"If we could live happy and healthy lives without harming others... why wouldn't we?" Good question, probably has something to do with not worrying where your next meal is coming from and possibly from not worrying about becoming someone else's meal.
How very precious , this is awesome. Their happiness is so cool and REAL.
Does anybody know what the song is called? 
So cute~~~~~~~
yummy!!
WOW! Thank you Edgars Mission for creating such a beautiful happy Vegan world!
Happy and healthy lives are boring. Danger and adventure require trading happiness and health, and that's what many people prefer.
If this doesn't put a smile in your heart, you must not have one.
@Tm Phanlc no mt bt ci ny ln coi :*
this food is so cute!
OMG they are so cute! I've never seen such happy bacon in my life.
This is too adorable! Playing on repeat
too cute u are amazing,,
thats cute
the boring Happiness stuff
Sia brought me here :)
So all of these animals are pretty much being raised for food.. kinda takes the cute out of it. 
No, this is a sanctuary! "Edgar's Mission is currently providing life-long care to over 150 animals who have been neglected, abused and discarded by farming industries."
This is a great video.
Il paradiso? Esiste!
#animali,  #animalia
This is beyond words. Almost surreal. Makes me wanna commit suicide living in a world where we slaughter daily innocent beings like cows, pigs and goats. We humans are the devil and animals are the innocent souls that we torment.
I'd like to ask can I upload the video on my channel and putting you links in the description?
OMFG i hate these asswipes that come and comment dumb shit on positive videos just cause they clearly have no fucking life and feel the need to get attention, like just grow the fuck up and start using some logic. I'm talking bout you Venom Snake, get educated.
mmmmmmmhhh those lambs will make good food in a few years

Dobro jutro
I am very slow to wake up in the mornings. Music like this stimulates my mind and nervous system. I play it while I get ready for the day. It works!
People who listening this you are my kind people i wish I have a more friends like you!
What the hell everyone is disturbingly cheerful
I might not know who you are but I just want to say that you are beautiful!
Even though I know I dont know you but everyone in the world is pretty even if everyone agrees that your ugly it matters in the inside and whoever said that is probably jealous so.... just want to say you are beautiful!
You made me so happy I will you,s this very day for school 
I really can feel the music is very calming and makes you happy, best music for the best day.
love it
always look forward to it when i need music
Thank you so much for the song !!!
I just watched somebody's eye get lazered then destroyed. Shes dead.
@Pizza The VI yep
final destination movie?

Today I got a Lego tree house but when I finished building it I accidentally fell on it and it smashed. I was sooo sad and this music made me happy!( :
May you have a happy year!

Could listen to this all day! 
Head Up - Keep on keepin on !!
I was sad after my friend treated me in a "different" way. This really cheered me up! Thanks so much!
It's such good healing music! :) 
the first is the best in my opinyon

It's such nice music isn't it!

Thank you
dude thanck u for everything im cheerful as heck have one as well :>
Lol ayone just has this full time playing while doing stuff on computer? lol
Who else watching this because there doing their homework and really stressed?
Smiles for me, Finally! 
Thank you.
Whoever you are, wherever you are, I hope you have a wonderful morning/day/ night.  If youre doing homework, work or anything else boring, just remember to smile and think about why youre doing what youre doing. Example: school will help you get an amazing job as long as you work hard  sometimes, bravery means laying down your life for something greater or even having the courage to live another day. If your at rock bottom, remember the only way left to go is up and you cant be brave without being scared. Happy day! 
CetaceanRei Thank you! It makes me happy to know that I made someone else happy
I really needed that motivation thank youuuuu. I recently started online school and sometimes I just sit there staring at my work and don't feel like doing anything whatsoever.

Thank You.
"solutions found" this music saved me $$.. I spent a week listening to this during..  a 1 hour commute. one unsuspecting day i ran into an officer who alarmed me suddenly, asked me to display my ride. i had to pull the earplugs with this song off... Since I dont have my ticket for the bus, $$$$ fine.. this music made me so positive, i was upset annoyed, but then I just suddenly KNEW what to do. While he has my ID, and is writing his ticket to give to unwilling me... I went for the ticket booth, and bought myself a ride ticket!! "Here, i have my ticket!" i say.. he still did not finish writing the ticket, and now was pretty upset that I did that. But, I could not help it, the music helped me with a solution and I just went for it!! thanks to the positive vibe, helps us to be smarter!
Whos here 2019 september?

I wrote a song to this.....

I had to find some music to make me happy. I was depressed about missing Japan and I couldn't help myself crying. What I think that made me cry about it was the time I was at the top of Tokyo Tower with my dad and little bro. The rest went to a temple tour. It was complete and I almost cried, but I wiped it off quickly or held my tears. After the entire summer 2019, I still think about Japan, but it makes me sad about it. At home one day, I expressed how I felt about Japan and my dad supported me. After the talk, I decide to listen to this. That's why I found this video.
Im listening to this because Im watching a scary movie.. but I listen to this when Im sad too! :D
Its my little siss b-day! One like equals one b-day hug for her. August 8.
:o happy birthday random guy's little sis!

Playing Slenderman with this in the background lmao
Beautiful day today, bless you all. :) stay positive

I actually have repulsive depression and I literally typed happy music and I got here ...
@Muffers 1 Why are you talking like I am depressed?
I never said there's a cure for depression, I just said music won't cure it. I actually had depression. Was diagnosed, didn't want help, tried to kill my self, failed, finally accepted help. It's been a lot better after talking with a psychiatrist. But honestly you might have a point saying "it always seems to come back". I never really thought about it that way. Sometimes my day is ruined just because I think of past mistakes or events. I thought I was just being weak or overdramatic, but maybe not.
Emil  nope it wont
Music isn't going to cure your depression though
This song helps me get through watching two little girls all day almost every day (they are crazy but this puts them in a good mood and sometimes puts them a sleep)

Thx tou are so nice
Its a bright Sunday morning, the flowers are on the grass and trees. The light from the sun is shining through your blinds. You give a sigh of relief that you are in your summer holidays, and that theres no school/work tomorrow. You go and get a lovely breakfast, and throw a toy for your pet dog. Then you go and get ready for the day. Once your dressed and cleaned up, you step outside your house and sit on your sun bed, with your favourite book in your hands. There are children playing in the garden across from yours. They are so happy. You smile to yourself and read. Afterward, you make yourself some lunch, and you and your dog head off to the park. There are many people in this park. Young and old. Children and elderly. You can smell the fresh grass, while the sun is beaming on your face. Your dog is thoroughly enjoying the walk, and so are you. You cant wait to meet your sister and her children for the picnic! Speaking of that, here they are! They come with a basket wrapped in a blanket. You say hello to eachother and your sister lays out the food on the blanket. They food is lovely, and you and your sister chat while her kids and the dog plays. After a long while of playing, walking, singing, chatting and having a lot of fun, you all head off for dinner. You go to our favourite restaurant, and get a table for outside, so the dog can be near you and the sun is out. You get your favourite food! It was very tasty, but now its time to head home. You come to your estate, the children are now inside, but the happy vibes and the flowers on the trees and grass. There is still no school/work tomorrow. The sun is still shining. You step inside with your dog. What a lovely day. And Ill do it all over again tomorrow! You say to yourself and your dog. Your dog barks and you laugh. Everyone was happy. Your dog was happy. Your sister was happy. Your niece and nephew were happy. Those children were happy...
You are happy.
Let those three words bless everyone reading this, have a nice day!
how long did it take for you to write this haha ? so inspirational hope you and everyone has a great day
Honestly... my Sunday morning would be a LIIITTTLE different for me, considering I have church at, like, 9:00am 
This means a lot 
Made my day
Hello Everyone, I was feeling quite down at the moment. So i put this on, and it gave me joy! Also, remember that you are loved. No matter what situation you are in, don't let it get the best of you, You're an overcomer! God Bless You All!

Hi......
it's interesting comparing happy music to depressing/sad music. Who would want to make their sad situation worse by listening to a creepy minor-keyed song? This is like, the anti-depressant of all medicines XD
This makes me happy (:
Amei essa musica linda linda e incrvel
Oi Danny Linda mesmo ajuda ajenti mesmo
Sadoofhappy
I love this can't wait till i can play ukulele like this :D
Actually, most of the plating is fairly simple

Wow this is very upbeat better than I was expecting for sure I needed some sunshine and every other "happy and Uplifting" playlist I tried just made me feel Depressed so thanks Lounge Music!!!
I love it
Happy music indeed! I added to my playlist if you don't mind.
Yesterday was a very sad day for me one of my idols committed suicide,  Anthony Bordain.  So needed some happy music to start my day
Awesome always love another way to enjoy various instruments and their happy sounds Light airy and refreshing to listen to!
makes doing some of my physical therapies I have to do fun too.
cool :)
This music makes me feel happy and easy.
How could anybody dislike this ukulele music!!??
Love it

well hope this music calms you down! I really like the music lounge music gives us :)
Perfect for relaxing and studying!!! I love this music!
Beautiful music, This made my day

I feel awesome
This made me happy after what logans vlog made me think about him
I really need this.  Even after my own online best friend is being a ass.  And him lying to me so much.  Idk if I can handle talking to him, nor, continue being his friend..be seriously didnt believe me that I was crying my balls off.  And going off, being high.  Like, are you kidding me.  He seriously doesnt believe me that I was crying while messaging him.  I had to leave my online game I play with him.  Cause I cant stand texting him or bother seeing him on..I just need a breath to bring some happiness in me.  I shouldnt let him get to me.  I only need to be concern about me and my mood.
Drop him honey. Some people aren't worth wasting time with. If your friend isn't supportive replace him with someone who is.
if someone share his sadness we don't have right to push him down if you don't respect feelings of someone else ... keep it for you next time... everybody feel bad sometime.... maybe one day it would be you.
Mikesityzx Maybe it's time to walk away. Lies etc are not part of a wholesome relationship especially if causing so much distress.
U have just to forgot him know life is too short to cry for someone like this
no one is really interested in your teenage style angst, there are some very real problems in the world, do try and get things in proportion please.
It is really happy music :)
Just needed some music to kill myself to, this should work nicely. :)
Love this thank you so much x
so sweet music!

Thank you so much for presenting such beautiful music. At the end of the day when activity is wrapped up I have gotten into the habit of searching for soothing music. It creates an aura of peace that banishes the stress and worry for a bit of time. I let it play in the background as I read or sleep. Thank you again.

Love you 
Tanks you so mush
I was listening to this song while  my 6 years old son was sleeping. I was reading some of the comments when my son woke up crying. He told me that by listening to this song made him remembered the awesome day we had together, that by listening to it he felt sad and happy at the same time because the day was gone,  and i just could hold to cry a little seeing how my son could identify his feeling through your music. It was awesome
Thank you for sharing this beautiful story with your child.
This song just made me sad...
Awsome 
I am the best yes I am

I know i am late but can u make a piani music video with much more rain sounds and a lil fast music?  I need that kinda music for studying..
Piani?
I left a comment on one of your songs and it goes for all you have.  But I used the word simple. I mean clean clear easy to hear.  In no way do I think your work is simple basic or easy.  Hugs sweet.  I want you to understand the magnitude of how your music influences soul.
Very good i was bored then i feel to relax and mind went to peace very good music.:)
Some friendly advice from the Netherlands, go sit outside in the garden. Take some deep breaths and close your eyes for a second to listen to this peace going through your body just a few second enjoy that feeling of peace you have around you and if you are comfortable open your eyes and look up to the stars. Just to see how bright they are shining for you and just watch a little bit more and a little bit closer and see how all the stars come together at one place to give you all the love, all the energy, all the light and all the peace they what you needed. Now you've tasted this inner rest, go to sleep with a feeling you are blessed to day and knowing tomorrow will be a new day with new love, new light and new energy you needed for this day. Enjoy your day and love the people around you. If yo have been taking this advice I will promise you that you will enjoy every little thing in life, just like all these little stars in this bright sky
very good.
It's become a habit now I can't study without your music
Lovely music! Which album is thus on? I'd like to download it. Thank you!

The Most Beautiful Music To Listen
Beautiful
Im 10 and i had suicidal thoughts and this helps me feel better
This song is beautiful, and Rebecca, totally agreed. Thought of suicide, never came close to doing it cuz I knew there was so much more, I can overcome struggles
Ute Jene oh lord only 10 years old. You have youre entire life ahead my love. Pre teen and teenage years go so fast. They are full of anxiety, the unknown, peer pressure and discovery. Everything at that age seems like the end of the world (Ive been there) but I promise you it will pass. There is life beyond school. Find what you love and go for it with all youre heart. What other people think is not important. Make yourself happy and try to make others happy and the world will seem like a nicer place. Please dont give up.
I struggle with horrible insomnia. Thank you for making beautiful videos that helps me fall asleep. 
the sounds are great for relaxing too.
I feel you brother

What Mother of Nature Brings Us
That we Humans that we are Plague asemos the Wars killing the Animals to the Plants Etc Etc all
in a few words we are destroying Mother Nature
Because we have that Hate Envy and many more things

Anyway
Excellent Romantic Music that lasts three hours or maybe a little more than three hours but very nice great music

Thank you nice music 
wish you all a best life and this is a very good music
WOW SO AMAZING
thank you for such stress reliever. I was able to clear my mind  with this amazing work
Thank you so much feeling peace in this beautiful morning
wonderful music
I am Mrs.Chong Won Kwak & today is December 23,2019. These beautiful places, resources of life including music like these gentle & loving should be enjoyed and shared by all, but should not be abused, used for evil and hurting. But then there is ugliness in world and some people cannot and never enjoy and experience. It is too much sadness, suffering, etc. How can certain people enjoy? Helping, serving, receiving together is happiness, not anything else. I cannot play music professionally even though I learned and enjoyed the experience of instrument and music with others. It was a good memory, too. Some do not get that experience, but it is not necessary. Having plenty, not being blocked of needs & healthy enjoyment and love with others is necessary. I did not and do not want to experience everything.
Thanks for helping people survive in even when they are depressed!!!
One day ur hard work will be paid off...one day u"ll get all d mental peace that u deserve... One day u"ll be so much blessed.... One day.... Insah Allah....one day
Beautiful and peaceful music, thank you.

Listening to relaxing music can minimize undue stress. The relaxation response involves the muscle relaxing, respiration slowing down and blood pressure lowering. 
You can actually be more efficient and productive in the office with pleasant music playing in the background. 
Light and jazzy tunes can help you savor your meals and enjoy the company you are with better.
Beautiful  music that accompanies me while I am walking. Thanks a lot.
Nice thing to hear and for reading Thanks
This is beautiful music! I love it, it helps me read! Thank you so much!

Japan is real autumn .                                        I am listening to this music while hearing the songs of autumn insects that chirp with transient life .                                                                                   I will be drawn into the world of the deep meditation while listening to this sound .

Decide that no matter what happens, you will do what you set out to do. If you are determined, possible distractions will still be therebut you will continue on your path and remain undisturbed. Sankalpa (determination) is very important. You cannot change your circumstances, the world, or your society to suit you. But if you have strength and determination you can go through this procession of life very successfully.

The music and scenery is so beautiful and peaceful! It reminds me of when things were so simple! Oh, how I would love to go back to that time in my life! I could spend a lifetime enjoying all of God's creation and splendor!
Life without music would be a mistake

Beautiful, reminds me of a story about two lovers who become lost between worlds, but in the end they find themselves together in each others arms again.. dancing  and loving each other until the end of time in a world surrounded by souls they have saved from the darkness.

El amor pocas veces ofende pero cuando lo hace no existe comparacin alguna de aquellas que tal vez se puedan conocer; las nicas veces que se ofende el amor es cuando una persona tiene que cambiar para encajar, cambiar no es malo lo malo es cambiar esencias. 
It says it will make me focus wrongggg it makes me fall asleep HAHAHA

Sounds beautiful! Random question, but what reverb are you using on the piano here?
"The Angelic Presence that is here will respond to the yearning of the heart and the soul. They will respond to what is truly being communicated and expressed through your requests and through your prayers. You may think you want your business to work, or for some outcome to happen for a certain person, but really it is often about something else. For at the basis of your request is the desire to be reconnected to the power and presence of God within yourself, and the Power and Presence of God that exists within this worldin people and beyond people, all the way into the Angelic Presence.
You may ask God for a favor or a miracle, but the deeper request really is to become connected because once you are connected to Knowledge within yourself, then God can speak to you through Knowledge. The Will of God speaks to you. It is not as if God leaves the universe and comes to whisper in your ears. It is the Will and the Intention of God, directed by the Angelic Presence here on Earth, that communicates to you through Knowledge.
People may be very confused about what Knowledge is because they are thinking of it in terms of psychology or their understanding of religion. But essentially, Knowledge is the deeper mind within you, through which Gods Will can communicate to you and guide you.
God has imbued you with a deeper consciencefar deeper and more pervasive this is than your social conscience, which has been established by your family, your society and your religious training, if you have had religious training. There is a deeper sense of what is right and wrong, what is true and untrue, what is just and what is unjust, that goes beyond your social conditioning and the expectations of others.
[...]
The Will of God flows through the Angelic Presence, and all the levels of the Angelic Presence, and flows through Knowledge within the individual and expresses itself there. Just like life force expresses itself in the plants and the animals, with each beat of your heart, and each breath that you take, Gods Will permeates everythingfinding avenues of expression, translating through levels of relationships."

@Matthew Horn Thank you
@Audry Koh Thank you so much for sharing. The New Message is a vast wellspring of wisdom sent by God through the Angelic Assembly that watches over the Earth, sent for the spiritual renewal of a struggling and fractured humanity. Immerse yourself in the Revelation at newmessage dot org--and let your soul be refreshed.
i believe what you have mentioned as it happened to me...our life is different from God's plan but what i understand, God's will is for us to be nearer to Him and to understand His will is for our good.  Praise the Lord for His grace and mercy.

Voc nem precisa prestar ateno... tudo frui, criando uma maravilhasa  calmaria ao seu redor.

5:25  the boy: *NOOOO NO MORE SISTERS!!!!!!*
ILove Girl
Idk what's so bad about having multiple younger sister. You could have so much fun with their boyfriends. However I would be very aware of the month.
And that's at 6:56
The one was WWE The Miz and his wife Maryse
Me encanto todas las reacciones jajaja
1:49 not even i get THAT exited for food

3:25 
Doing my gender reveal on the 27th
5:32 when you know that you need to have one More annoying sister!q
Its interesting, but I feel like all those, crazy, unique ones are really just the adult version of those dumb, over-the-top promposals that the popular kids do in high school.
Goes to show that some people dont really change after high school
To be honest they really just attack each other
The Best 1:20
I'm from Brazil 0:08
6:43 The Miz AWESOME
1 ,2,3 am gril what boy
All this insanity in order to reveal the sex of the child I wished if I were in their place and celebrated me 
this is just non sense to me.. wtf
Marisse wwe sera
teacher: what's the definition of sexism?
me: showing him this video
So the result of this stupidity is A-everyone screams like idiots for a boy or B-everyone screams like idiots for a girl. Whats the point? These. Must. Stop.
https://youtu.be/f4Jso3x4BrI
8:13 
That is the coolest gender reveal
Bsmllah dinit din
why is this necessary though
Why is it such a big deal? I don't get it
Soooo what if their having twins and one of them doesnt know? Do they show both colors
y los q queran el otro sexo?? Porq hay personas q suean con una princesita toda su vida,,y de verdad no quieren mas varones o los q quieren varones porq tienen ya muchas hembras,,pienso q muchos gritan simulando alegra ante sus amistades y familias,. y en verdad deseaban el otro sexo,,es verdad q un hijo ya es un regalo hermoso,,pero siendo sincera,,cuando no te llega del sexo q deseabas,,ese momento ya no es tan feliz como lo soaste,,gritas,pero muchas pensando q ser para la prxima
The miz and maryse wwe Superstars 
so annoying when they find out its a girl and don't celebrate for it
Its kinda sad that most of the dad wasnt happy with daughter seems like they dont like whatever the baby is they will accept
Happy one year anniversary of this vid
**pink balloons start floating**
Kobe Bryant: FUCK!!!!!!
some people MAD some people HAPPY  but a MAN EXCITED for a GIRL NEVER SEEN before 
Lol the dude in number two lol that's how excited my boo will be when my next pregnancy is with a boy lol. . .
Who the hell would want a boy, thats gay
Great collection of baby gender reveal, lots of fun. I 've just posted our baby gender reveal and how they pranked me. I would love some support /feedback so please hit subscribe and check it out.  Many thanks in advance.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG538mujmPY
Disturbing
No one:
Literally no one:
Me at 5:51: you does anybody know what is the babys a boy or a girl or what exactly happened
Princess Lilo it was boy
Why r they so happy do they not know that they will probably switch genders midlife
6:12 scary but exciting and sad
SPLATOON 6:12
5:50 JAJA
4:04 IS THAT A TORNADO SIREN HOLY COW
nobody:
8:34 *kanye west*
Stop this gay ass shit, millennials. Just TELL people the gender.
Mucjas felidades boy
Ewww i hate baby ewww grosss
You were a baby once
Their expressions make me smile
5:27 YO QUERIA UN HERMANO !!!
En el minuto 5 : 50 me cage de risa
Just think of cleaning all that confeti
All fun in games until the kid is a teen 
4:05 I dont get it! Do they have a boy and a girl
0:20 poor little guy was like wtf
Its so rare that a dad gets excited when its a girl that when it  happens I get so emOTIONAL
Stupid shit
How's it stupid
0:48 
All of this extra parties for what ? Whats the purpose ? They know they will have a boy or a girl whats the big deal ? The women are just happy they have the babys  father next to them thats all! 
Most of these people in the video would be separated/divorced before the child reach age 6 !
I feel like its a true girls world with these gender reveals
Congrats
I wonder if somebody had tripplets what color would it turn
5:28 Gonna be my reaction when I see its a girl
Wtf is going on, they get high or something?
5:30 Bad luck for that brother. He will always be a minority.
5:29    
For the women who are complaining about men not being happy with a baby girl, well this is exactly why, a lot of complaining. We just want a mini version of us, some one we can relate to coz most of our younger years as men are over. We just want a bestfriend again,  someone we can watch sports with, play sports or video games with, drink beer with,  talk about women etc. In all honesty how does a man relate to a woman? Its very hard what do we do? Tea parties and braiding hairs? Its not that were not happy were getting a girl,  its just that women are very hard to relate to.
0:44 the dad was sooooooooo happy when he was having a baby boy
8:59 they must have scared that dog
Who wants a girl or boy link down
I want a girl
Payaso
Purple smoke/balloons
lol my dad didn't want me to be a girl 
he was disappointed
0:36 that's me when I find out I have no homework 
Aww so sweet! I love how the parents are so happy!
Check out our party video as welll :) https://youtu.be/RNFXnzafXsk
6:44 MIZ AND MARYSE 
8:34 KANYE WEST hahahahahhaha
Soy la unica que es Argentina y que v3 estas cosas en el 2019 ??
Nadie yo nomas?
Who puts the color in the items? The doctors? What?
Aw the second one 
About all this gender reveals, i wonder what would be the situation (color...), if the baby was HERMAPHRODITE.  (intersex)
Wait...what?!...what that mean?! 
I'm just kidding>>2nd degre.
5:49 xdd
KATTY 
1:50 "unfortunately the babys dad couldnt survive he broke his spin and head while all of the basket team fell on him :("
That happy dance tho
Rip my ears
We did a gender reveal and I got a baby brother
It kinda feels like everyone one wants a girl and it goes in the opposite direction if it's a boy
5:29 is such a mood
The flying balloons are bad for the environment
Whats the point of gender reveal if theyre going to identify themselves as penguins in the future
It's a boy= Guy's go nuts and tackle each other down or into the pool.
It's a girl= Girl's get all excited and Scream men just smile and stand not happy.
6:47 *it's actually the miz and maryse from wwe!!*
Share this gender reveal! 
https://youtu.be/_9a2Iih1JXk
3:06 when he ran off 
8:05, best one ever
3:08 literally just jumped off the distance
3:53 Poor guy popped the air LOL
1:06 el NICO que se super emociona por tener un "nia"
Some of these are mad weird 
17:16 what a unique type of gender reveal
I love the dad's who get excited when they find out they are having a girl! Get excited for both because child are a blessing! My dad left me in the hospital because I wasn't a boy and he wanted a son! I'm better off without that baster
The second one the man got exetied and i saw poor man he want a boy put whene they open it he was happy i was hapy what was his reaction
I love 8:13 & that bowling ball 1.
But man dat poor dog in a box.
The kid at 5:31 is me every time when the alarm goes off for school
5:26 yup that boy will be upset xD
0:10 who the hell cuts a cake like that
For me 8:05 is the best 
I liked the dancing one where the guys outfit lit up pink. That was really cool and original!!
1:57 that man in the basketball uniform at the end was like these men are my bed  and just plopped himself onto them
5:37 
That dog at 9:45 though!! His butt wiggles when he's happy!  What a damn cutie!! 
Ive got 2 months i cant WAIT
1:04 "It's a boy"
*pink smoke intensifies*
It's a boy
It's red
6:35 first dad who isnt excited about having a son
I love seeing dads that truly want little girls !  my boyfriend is praying for a little girl now
0:26 you could tell its a boy because if you look carefully on the right side it says BOY
What a great video! I wish all of these family's have a beautiful and   happy life! God bless them! 
Me when I watch these
_Am I even gonna get married ;-;_
https://youtu.be/07B9lMnkeeg watch our version of gender reveal, Hope you like it

I hate it how the first one the girl jumped like B**** YOU HAVE A BABY IN YOUR BELLY!!!
Can u imagine how disappointed the guy at 0:35 would have been if it was a girl 
Why are they shouting??? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:49 they all knock him down

Balloon poops and cake cutting and cupcakes are so common now :-: now its so depressing
How's that depressing?
5:32  When  I lose to a game
It's a boy cue the tackling!
I find it so cute that a good chunk of the time, the dad is super excited with either boy or girl. On one hand, if its a boy, hes probably thinking Ah yeah, Im gonna have junior to take to games and go fishing, while with girls its Im gonna protect this little angel with my life and treat her like a princess. Its always nice to see when both parents are equally excited about the reveal.
5:33 why is there always at least 1 kid that dousnt like the gender and starts to cry i mean just be happy that youre able to have another sibling!
Because they're kids
0:42       
https://youtu.be/7jEq0imF7-o this was our reveal!
for people who don't want to do it as big, i made an app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brandon.GenderReveal just hook it up to the tv and let the 30 second countdown begin for your friends and family to see or simply just screen record your phone of the app countdown and share it on facebook :)
5:28 when you didnt get what you wanted for Christmas
If again another girl I'm all like (nope see ya later ima be like I did not know
You know the vids where it's the kids who get the suprise well one of them is upset yeah that's kinda me but I dont cry if it's a girl I dont pay attention to them If they cry or need something if it's a boy I'm all
 in cuz I always wanted a  brother and I would do anything dont blame me I have 3 sister and want a brother
Kanye West :))))))))))

Awww that little boy in the corner of the first 1 just stood there  Idk why I found it so cute.
Yet another stupid excuse to waste money and time. Wait until u have the bloody baby. So much can go wrong
You can do that, some people want to have fun in the process.
Hater

First reveal will triggers you being an oc
8:57 POOR DOGGY U CANNOT DO THAT TO A LIVING ANIMAL?!!!

Hater

I feel bad for 5:43 that lady hit her nose
So lucky to have the tower coloured
5:30 I feel so bad for him

Right?!? Why do people keep doing this?? Research! Save yourself the LITERAL headache! LOL
3:15 did anyone else think he was finna jump in the lake. 
M Zazzy paper me
A cake is a *unique* shower idea?
I mean yeah the guys arent that happy if its a girl..but lets face it. If its a boy, the mother isnt that excited either you can tell. Its just natural but everyone is bashing guys for looking " sad" to have a girl. Moms do the same thing with having boys. Really!
How amma behave when I have get a boy
Boys=less work
I got pregnant at 13 years old
It seems that fathers are more exited for boys
Min 8:56 the dog ran for his life 
These babies gonna die if these pregnant women keep jumping like that XD

Imagine popping a gender reveal balloon, and all the confetti is pink, white, purple, black, and blue 
Can you tell me how to enable ppl to submit videos? how you created the link. Is it a Google feature? Thanks.
@2M Baby Gender Reveals ok, thanks. I see you have to pay $1.99 a month for 100gb of space?
5:31 poor child
0:36 i really wanted to see his face when he got a girl.
I love watching this ,, it gets me excited,,it makes me cry watching this videos ,,, if oneday I get pregnant Ill do this and be so happy and have happy tears 
The man at 00:43
1:50 the reason why I dont like playing basketball when Im doing a gender reveal
Can this video be used as proof against evolution?
Me chocking on water 2:22
So sad
How so many men just make this about jumping around like clowns 
instead of embracing their spouse and hugging and congratulating 
them, no mater what gender. Just making it a show about themselves.
Besides, guys, don't make it that obvious that you want a boy. 
Really embarrassing
0.45 thoes look like church moves 
If I was pregnant and I was having a son and I found out at my gender reveal party I would be so excited!!!! And if I found out I was having a daughter I'd be like "F**k." because I already have 2 sisters and I don't want to be around anymore girls.
Guys wanting boys only are part of what is wrong in this world !
Im pregnant with baby #2 and for some reason these videos make me emotional 
6:58 thats the Miz and Maryse from WEE
Legal a forma que os estrangeiros manifestam essa surpresa de saber sexo do beb. 
It works like this;
If its a boy- Everyone congratulates the father
If its a female-everyone congratulates the mother
These fill me with such joy 
0:36 me when I get over 60 on my math test...
3:26 a purple??
Transgender????
No it's Nation Girl

Omg, The Miz And Maryse 
5:30 the kid is so cute!

The miz and Maris was awesome
balela lquido siesbonito
Quebonito 
How does the bowling one work???
What does purple mean i thought it was pink
These 'Gender' Reveal parties make me sad now 'cause they make for way too much expectation. Also, the ones with the doggies are really cute but I feel badly for the first one 'cause he/she seemed terrified.
Um, I couldn't really tell but one of them was purple. Does that mean twins of both genders?
0:40 lol
The thing is..
Im 12..
And i enjoy watching this thing?
The basketball one was so cute and sweet
THESE ARE GORGEOUS
why is no one talking about 3:19
Are you assuming thileir genders?
Yay. No more good sleep.
0:01 WHO THE HELL CUTS CAKE LIKE THAT
3:25 when the daughter watches the video in the future: 
*Girl*: you didnt like me before I was even born dad!
he cried cus he was so happy !
Um ok it says happy new year in the beginning of the video but it was posted in November ...
I wanted to cry tbh
" Kanye West " 
I bet a lot of these eventually ended in miscarriages.  They should do a miscarriage reveal with balloons full of blood and meat.
I love the baby gender reveals that the mom and dads are happy no matter the gender
Why the fuck they always screaming
soy la unica que hablo espaol 
I didn't get the two box ones until I realised it was gains and they were girls
All the kids that where crying because they wanted a girl for example and got a boy would end up loving her or him just watch
Dog he like me boy so u better have a boy
5:27 F for that boy
"It's a boy " wooooaaww yeahhh
"ts A girl" wooooaaww yeHhhh.
So, It s enough to be healthy.
Thanks for this video so I can tell my mum about theses ideas cause she pregnant omg I want it to be a girl cause I already have one lil bro and I dont want an other one like HELL NO ONE IS ENOUGH 
The second one, the dad really made me laugh
5:28 THE KID THO HAHAHA
look at this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h02WrvANbY
At 1:57 the dude was just like  ok i am just gonna sit. Oh ya ok i am sitting now ya know how long is this gonna last?
2:05 oh my God twins  really !?
It's nice to see dad's happy to have a girl.
5:45 was the best reveal
I love motorcycle gender reveals
0:23 blue baby  Baby blue!! B L U E! 
con este video solo me dan ganas de tener otro bebe jajaja bueno tal vez solo hacer una revelacion :)
who came here from h3h3?
Did you just assume their gender?
I can send the butt hurt gender equality ppl coming
Who cuts cake like that...the first video made me mad
What do you call that pink "smoke? "
The reason husbands dont like baby girls is bc they have to deal with the dude they bring home pffff
Its basic biology that happens millions of times every day. Its not unique enough to warrant a special party to tell everyone what the gender is. Really... nobody with a working brain cares. Thats what registries are for. Stupid humans.
why are gender reveals or anything like that even a thing?
that baby is gonna hate their parents anyway in like 16 years but they are making a whole party for them yikes
Why do i feel like they are more excited when its a boy
Meu sonho  um bb menino
Why do kids cry over these things
Why would it matter if it is a boy or girl? What a stupid tradition is this. Animals are better than these stupid humans.
i agree
The bowling one and the dog were so cool
       
Imagine being the kid and years later you see your gender reveal lol
5:33 lmfaoo
Hey check out my Gender Reveal on my channel
Too Many girls. Wow! 
The light on top of the building was cool as shit
The one with the little puppy is not nice at all.
yall see that giraffe at 3:15
In 5:43 that was a fail and why does it say BEST  poor women  she started  to  cry
I think she cry
These gender reveals parties are such a bad idea. As evidenced in so many of these clips, men are rarely as delighted to be having a daughter as a son. Sucks to be a disappointment before you're even born.
yeah its sad
Karas Aunty Theyre gonna find out the gender one way or another and its better to throw a gender reveal before the baby shower so people know what to expect. Besides, speaking to a lot of pregnant women, the mothers also prefer boys to girls. Its not just the dads but the moms. And to mirror that Ive also seen a lot of fathers to be who want girls instead of boys as well. Just because a few people prefer to have sons to daughters in literally one compilation doesnt really set a precedent. There would be a lot more surveying to be done to say that there is a hard boy lean among fathers. 
This is hardly evidence. Just like how seeing a bunch of people on tumblr claiming to be angelkin does not make them angels. Its a claim based on a misinterpretation of reality and nothing more. Exactly what you are doing.
idk why but the ones with only the wife and husband and maybe a child or 2 or 3 make me sad..
What does purple mean lol
0.49 happy feet
Why are there so many girls in this new generation??
0:37 is me when school is finally over

~what if some of them blind colour~ wow I'm so happy for them
Irgendwie sind die Mnner da voll albern
People scream and are happy regardless of what gender it is, it's not like the crowd goes all quiet and people are like ' damn, that sux...you're having a girl, what a shame'
6:43 The Miz and Maryse

I don't care about what gender it is. Having children is the best feeling I ever have. Even though I'm young to have children I'm 12.
3:52 we know ya'll british 
3:27 hahaha um vdeo do Brasil 
...and then the kids grow up to be assholes and none of these people could care less what gender an asshole is.
0:33 That dance literally had me laughing in tears.
If I have 1 baby i want a GIRL
If I have twins I want twin GIRLS
If I have triplets I want 2 GIRLS and a BOY
I have two girls and if I have more kids I want them to be girls.
Amber Morgan well I wish u luck and that's your opinion I just prefer baby girls to boys
GoldenAngelsNursery when I have kids idc I just healthy kids
Baby girl I love the way back to the shop
I'm sorry but they don't The Patents know? Who prepares The Air Baloons???
Thank you for the answer
But still I'm wondering why The parents of the unborn don't know. Sometimes even the mother to be seems to Not know. I'm from Germany and I was The First to know my babys gender... 
*OHBABY*
Im happy for all of them
Check out our gender reveal ! https://youtu.be/sBqqAPb7LoE
We just found out were going to have TRIPLETs!!!! This video is so cute
The fact that these kids are probably 2 by now
At 3:33 there is like a bunch of ladies around that poor guy. lol
7:01 IS that theMiz???
5: 47
This is fucking retarded
this is so wholesome
Me internally: Why are they getting excited over loss of work, money, sleep and mental health for about 10 years?
BardiX Official a baby is much more then that, grow up a little and youll understand
5:30 I hope the gender is incorrect and that is actually a boy not a girl because he already has 2 sisters.
@Piper Harrison but he might care, you never know
I can tell you that kid wone mind it soon, Im the opposite of him, I'm a girl and i have 3 brothers and I always wanted a sister, but now I would never trade my brothers for a sister. he wont care that he has all sisters later in life, it's not a big deal.
This is awesome!!! Thanks for sharing
The fathers reactions when it's a boy!
0:37- when school ends
5:31-when school starts

Or if my parents just asked what i was at the ultrasound
BooM Pow my parents didnt even want to know
More ppl are excited to have a boy then a girl tho lol!
Dios.  Dios c odiebebxls.
This makes me cry from happiness
To all the parents and kids who were disappointed with the genders, how would you feel knowing your parents were disappointed with your gender?
Youre suppose to wait till it comes out before you know the gender... ruins all the mystery for the actual birthday! js LoL

Do you know math?
Bossom 180 herey
Ciara.c 101 all these babys are allready born

We are having a gender reveal party in 3 weeks, we are very happy either way whether its a boy or girl as long as the babys healthy (which it is). Cant wait to film it and show the baby when theyre old enough that their whole family was there and loved them from the start! 
3:17 the fucking giraffe
Is that THE MIZ
The guy that got really excited when he found out he was having a girl is the type of energy I wanna achieve
Liv Hogan thats gross. Toi should love your children equally.
Real men love their children regardless what the sex is
umm which one??

Kuhn x ClassicZ i dont blame em . If i have a daughter thats my baby but if I have a son thats anybodys but my baby

Myliana Jones not that 1 part with the little boy when it was a girl lol 
This is just bootiful to see 
Even so most of men were happy having a son but as I observed there are more fathers who are more closer to their daughters if they have
                
@BabyCubSTL03 you are lesbian congratulations!!!
@donald trump
I swear Everyman who is so disappointed when he finds out hes having a girl is just being hit with the memory of every bad thing theyve ever done to a girl 
 Hey, did you spot it??? Hehe
Yes!! 
I like the dust gender reveal
That second couple seems very loving. I know that I only get this small clip, but I already I know that they have a healthy relationship. Thats how strong their love is. 
Qui regarde sa en tant que francais
Awwwww
0:10 
me- who the hell cuts a cake like that
@Kaylin Ann 1) so everyone can see right away and 2) when you cut it normally, sometimes the pink or blue is shown when crumbs fall and not everyone sees at the same time. 
I like how she did it, quick and everyone sees.
Hhhhhhhhhhh cuz everyone should see
What I said!XD
Probably Michael from AGP
@loudon aa Yuki uwu
The Miz and Maryse
5:47 he covered her crying face. You already know hes an asshole husband

Like most are boys
I really enjoy watching this!! amazing moments  My journey starts at the beging of the new year! I found my fertility center through www.ivfinmexico.com after a long research. I'm hopeful that 2019 will be the
biggest year for me and for all couples trying to conceive

The Miz and Maryse!!

I have no children and have zero plans to have any... but I always find myself watching these.
0:47 he must be a church preacher!

@crowntotheundergroud smh why are you being so god damn fucking sexist
crowntotheundergroud you dont know if he dident want a girl so stop assuming

What is that thing called at 1:09 for gender reveal?
What is that thing called at 1:09 for gender reveal?
3:28 what does purple mean?
Emmas World its a girl
I wanna be Winston 
And again, there is something very unsettling about a child's sexual organs being viewed as the most important trait to know about them. No one is throwing hair color reveal parties. Or blood type reveal parties. Or even chromosomal typing reveal parties.
Focusing so much on the configuration of a baby's external genitals is all it is. This extra focus on that specific quality is part of why there is such weight given to gender and gender roles in society, and is directly tied to the historic disenfranchisement of women, trans people, and anyone else who doesn't neatly fit into society's boxes.
@aijun ruan shut the fuck up, also you dont even know what thot means
aijun ruan how are suppose to find out the hair color and blood type??? Lol you cant be serious with those comparisons. We didnt know gender until ultrasound existed. You do know there are ppl who do prefer not to know till the day off. Why do ppl think they can control others beliefs? Youre doing exactly what you say you hate!
Welp this is 2019
Saying that gender is "just their genitals" is idiotic, men and women will act different based on their gender its not some type of social norm you moron
I saw the Miz and Maurice
I want to know where they got the powder thing at 1:06
Could you do twins general revel
Are you sure this is the best baby gender reveal? 5:50 a girl got hit in the face with a box!
Kai Anderson 
READ MORE
Someone was holding her baby by the ears she is an abuser
KATTY 
At 3:39 it looks like Alex
Every box reveal always fails. You cannot put 15+ balloons in a box held by a single string and expect it not to fall. Nonetheless I always enjoy watching these videos.
0:39 My new Fortnite dance
Whats the color for non binary
No baby will know its "non binary" till they're older lmao.
There is no non bianary, only girls and boys
5:24 
What were they expecting, like a new gender will come out or what ? . It is either boy or girl why all this drama
0:44 Fortnite dance: the reveal XD
Hootenanny
Default
No. Fortnite bad.
The miz from WWE
They should put the words pink or blue on snowcap slime for a reveal
I can't wait for mine!!
1:08 The one man who is super happy to be having a girl!
Cibele Felix no women much prefer girls thats a fact!
mshotcounselor girls lie manipulate and cheat
His reaction would be the same no matter what.
Cibele Felix 2:29
conspericy theary boys rape, murder and steal so you stfu
00:45
Dump truck gender reveal  must watch! https://youtu.be/e82QuoZ4oVk
I love watching these videos when Im bored
@Violet Araujo  i like watching this
Me too
People should stop calling them "gender" reveal, gender and sex are soo different, sex is the part and gender is what the child chooses. They should call it sex reveal not gender, they don't know when their gender would change.
Thicki Nikki gtfo with that false bs
Pls dont reproduce
you're delusional?
Thicki Nikki wtf 
boy: hmm is this a boy?
**then opens**
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
(its sad to be one of the girls)
MAXIMUS MEMES and gaming Having one sister as a boy is torture enough and getting 2 more would be pain
The one with the Kia car is me!!
@L7ckyDuck honestly idk what was going on with me that day 
@Stars Shine Bright damn bruh, why would you put the timestamp if you were gonna say that?
@MintyK7Playz * 7:36 or maybe just stop being lazy and just watch the video ?
@Chelsea Yagong omg congratulations!!!
