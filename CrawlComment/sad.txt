Undo Lyrics
Creator: Sanna Nielsen


Silent, I can't wait here silent
Working up a storm inside my head
Nothing, I just stood for nothing
So I fell for everything you said

Hear the rumble
Hear my voice
Silent, I can't wait here silent
Gotta make a change and make some noise

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad love

Trouble, baby I'm in trouble
Every time I look into your eyes
Save me, oh, I'm gonna save me
Far away from all the crazy lies

Hear the rumble
Hear my voice

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad

My sad love
Undo

I LITERALLY CAME HERE JUST TO CRY I WANT TO CRY EVEN MORE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HUHUHU I HATE MY SELF
I must cry. I was so happy.
The video is no't cry
This is hilarious, this is the most cheesy, pathetic attempt at emotion I've ever seen.
@Rambunctious Recruit Agreed.
I love how unnecessarily positive it is pushing the world to be, as if Russia and Iraq don't exist.
I did not cry!like if u did! I don’t have a grandma...I lost her...I was sad when I heard the news that........She died...I NEVER got a single chance to see her...I was sad and mad...Really not a story
I’m very sensitive and I was so emotional I cried a lot I’m crying wile I typed this if your the same like

STOP FRICKING CUTTING ONIONS
On God I didn't cry 🙂
I almost cried
I don't cry but I was shocked.
I resisted, but I wanted to cry... 😥😥
OMG this is so sad! And now i remember when my sis died in cancer and my mom suicided 
LIKE IF U LOVE UR MOM AND SIS
Im very emotional but It didn't make me cry
really someone cry while watching this shit?
I came here to stop my anger and be sad :)
So I was watching this at school and everyone Saw me crying.....
My emotions work strangley only music trigers my emotions.
I can’t cry for myself so when I’m sad I’ve gotta watch sad videos
This story is kind of like what happened in real life for me but take away the part when people pay for you i wanted something but my parents said they cant afford anoff money cause there broke back in there days they couldnt buy food they had to hunt 😭😭😭
You are a fool to name this video, guaranteed to make you cry. Crying is sadness this is heart warming.
I am Youssef from Morocco, a student. I loved marriage. A professor older than me she is 32 years old. I am 21 years old. I love her for four years and do not like any girl without her. I always communicate with her on the communication sites and see her directly. Although four years have passed and I love her, I have not been able to tell her that I love her and wanted her to marry because I did not have a job currently and she has a job and a monthly income. That made me not be able to tell her about me I love her and wanted her to marry, she is very beautiful, I loved to follow her on a daily basis, and I see her pictures, and also religious and respectful, so her beauty is wonderful and I always see her in my mind is the beautiful princess in this whole world, but I fear that I did not tell her that I want her to marry and marry someone else, this matter will make me stay sad throughout my life Because I always find her sweet and a wonderful aura to me, and I wouldn't be able to give love to any other girl without her. Please if you have any advice, share it with me or contact me on the contact at this number 0613361717 with all my respects to you. Thank you.
and this is so sad it's like my mom past away and I got my last kiss and huge I am crying so much😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
this is so sad it's like my birthday but nobody come
That's my life....
Wasent sad
Am I heartless for not crying.

Because I saw dis before.
Lmao why should i cry, because of a cake?
This only made me happy 😊
aM I SOulLeSs I DiDn't cRy aT alL anD JuSt LAUHeD xDdd
So beautiful I always help out
Sure are you sure about that I’m a heartless bastard
I once bought some bread and dog food for a homeless man that spends every day and night trying to help himself and his dog he is unable to get a job because he has some type of mental illnesses that prevents him from working (I think he has memory loss or some type of short attention span) and he's too poor to get treatment 😢😢😢
Almost but it's really touching never forget this video 😟
😭😭😞😞
😭😭😞😞
That was so sad and cool in the same time
😭😭😭😭😭😭
😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢🍰🎂
this is 😞 saf
sad i meant
i did not cry
Powerfull aura that can make people cry. But not this person.
The end was cute and I also cried!
I loved that video it was so sad I almost cried but I didn't that was nice of that man to give that little boy a Birthday cake. But like if you cryed.
That wasn't sad. It was just interesting
Bro not funny didnt laugh
What a misleading title...
I get the video is good and all, but honestly when doing an act of kindness, you shouldn’t expect anything in return. Even if they offer to give you something in return, you shouldn’t accept it as to me is seen as an act of payment for your deed. Doing good deeds or giving up things just to get nothing is the sure way that people should live.
Nice
This isn’t sad this is so happy!!! Happy tears!!?!?
Lol
It did make me cry
All this for a cake =>= (it was very touching though)
I cry ed 4 times
I wasn’t sad it was actually happy
I didn't cry ;-;
This was pretty funny 😂
I'm way to emotional I'm just stressed and I'm weird so I watch sad vids to cry
So sad and happy
I didn’t got a chance to cry but I liked it anyways.
3:36 try not to laugh 😂😂
My parents are wondering y am crying
I think that it is more of a happy storie than a sad one.
❤️❤️❤️
u copied this video, u do not deserve anything for someone else's work, and you still ask for subs and likes? You are definitely not worthy.
I didn’t cry
This is absolutely not sad. I'm laughing😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
The last one really got to me...wow
Bruh there is invisible ninjas in my room cutting onions
I didn’t cry:v that was wired?
Thx to God we have nice people
i actually almost cried. Like I felt my eyes heating up not shredding tears

Kill them with kindness 💔
This actually happened to me before but with a zebra cake instead. Me and my sister went to a tiny store super close to our house and we didn't have enough money for a zebra cake. We put it on the counter for someone else to buy. But went we exited the store the man ran up to us and said that he paid for it for us. I was so thankful. I gave him a hug then left💖! Everyone can show a spark of kindness by just handing out a gift. Every kindness has it's own world and anyone can join it if they really try!💖
😭😭😭😭😭😭.  So.  Sad
People nowadays fever do that

A girl in my class got bullied for being Chinese, yay

If we can make up a word i would want one where no one goes hungry, where no one ever died. But you know such a world exists already don't you? The lord made that world, the question is are you ready to join it? ready to throw away sin for light? to help others? The lord will help you through it just keep praying, and we should do this for anyone, rich or not I will do it when I grow up. And everyday i will come and see how many people had actually read this through, and took the time to understand. The lord and i love you all so much. Your always loved and your always rich, you just don't know it yet.
3:37 I'm grinning so hard and this is suppose to be sad.

I dont crying
I was sad already. I got a 0 in one of my classes. So my parents said I needed to straighten up. I was able to convince my mom, but some reason my dad thought I couldn't. I went up to him and tried to convince him, but he rejected. So I just went to bed and found this video, hoping I'd at least get a bit happier. I did.
It wasn't a sad video it was more like a happy video to me.
Imagine they got food poisoning. That would be way sadder
Nope
Karma❤️

I wasm't able to cry.. no it was the opposite. I was really happy i dunno why but, I wanted to watch thos bc i want to cry but it makes me happy.. ok
I watched this because I'm breaking inside. And I feel numb and I know I'll feel better after crying. But I watched this and I still can't cry... I'm so frustrated. I want to cry.

Can't cry, relate too much
A little lesson, your parents  may not afford things you want (a gaming system, clothes, toys etc.) , but they love you and re working hard to keep you under a roof and making sure youre loved and smart. Everytime I earn money, I give most of it to my mom because I dont live with her and she works very hard. Love yall <3
I didn’t cry >:3
Who watched this just to see if they’d cry
It is not  sad
I’m crying 😢
I don't cry its vecos I m enoshen I have non and I hare my mom
Hannah Peddie you shouldn’t hate her unless she’s bad. She suffered 9 months just to have you. At least be grateful cause some people don’t even have moms. 😕
This man is one of gods angels

If you help people your future can be better
I didn’t cry so much but I actualy not cry😄I’m okay!
it was a sad story but i didn't cry
I'm only watching this because my eyes are dry and I don't have eye drops
I didn’t cry
Failed to make me sad more like happy
What's the sad part?
who came here to cry, but was so emotionally drained from everything so they couldn't cry?
cuz same
Yep I'm here just for that
I've been crying for a solid 40 minutes watching other videos
Me. Not because it's 2020 now. I really hope that this year will be a great and beautiful one. But I'm so drained from the feeling that i'm alone despite having many friends around me. I'm drained from the feeling, that i'm not that emotional because i'm walking along poor men without the possibility to help them. I'm drained from the feeling that i'm losing my deepest friends, because they study elsewhere or because we don't meet us that much except going to gym or drinking alcohol to be "happy". I'm drained from the feeling being not accepted by people because my origin.

And it is so ironic that i'm trying to cry by watching this video because otherwise i couldn't... 

I hope for everyone that they will be happy for the rest of their lives, but it's unfortunately unrealistic...
honestly, yeah.
*meeeee
Wow made me cry in -0.000000000000001 seconds
I didn't cry. I haven't been able to cry for ages and I can't

K. I didn't cry but that was very heartwarming tbh.
History will repeat itself, the girl will buy a cake for someone else and then that someone else will buy a cake for someone else. The cycle shall live on
PLOT TWIST

3:40
When you think of something smart to say in the comments

Ahhhh so saddd
Tears are dropping
I have only cried bc this reminded me when I wanted something and My mom said “we don’t have enough,maybe next time.” And then I said “you said that the last 3 times we came here”
i didnt fully cry
I didnt cry, But if i saw a grand parent saying no because she did not have the money, then i whould have stepped in like that kind man did, Thanks for sharing this
This is reversed instead of making me cry it made me happy that knowing that there is some people out there who actually still have a heart ❤️

This is not sad at all
I cri becuz my pee sha fell
I cried
Uh no, because NOTHING makes me cry unless it has happened too in my life, well LIKE if you want to hear the story!


So I had a bunch of friends, I had an across the street neighbor who was a year younger than me, 3 years later, I met a close neighbor which I became very close friends. Then my ATSN (across the street neighbor) told her a secret, a secret which hurted me for months. My DTSN (which you can guess) told me the secret: She didn’t like me. Her mom hated my mom. She didn’t like the look at my face I am which she thought I wasn’t telling the truth. It really hurt me. She also said that I don’t say HI to her mom. Which I DO, sometimes I can be really shy. Then when my mom can back from China for 2 weeks, she met Annette. And my mom said Annette was pretty and I was ugly. So yeah.
Sometimes if someone is poor or not enough money. People's will have to safe them for their sadness. Everyone can be a hero to them.

Just comment below :-)
That one time when you commented "I didnt cry" and u were actually crying, then when you want to cry you cant.
Btw i didnt cuz no one died
Who else did not cry

If a dog died I would’ve been on the ground crying

Stingy little girl😑 
"Last time you said that" That doesn't matter if you can't afford, it you can't just be grateful for what you have
i guess those dislikes on that video are negative spam bots cause no human could dislike such a video
So wholesome 😭

The man when he was little , he was so cute.
Why would you dislike this video
When I watch this video I cried.
I’m just here because I want to cry but I’m unable to do so. I want to do it for mental health reasons. I feel like I have an emotional blockage.
I didn’t cry but it was very sweet and I wish all people were like that,kind,generous and helpful
Sorry but you will have to do better than that like a dog story or a elderly dies
I had to get something out my eye. This worked

OMG I SOOOOO CRYED :[
I thought I was strong enough I was wrong
The girl's smile is ugLY tho
It was alright not that sad
100% did not cry lol
i actually really liked that video :)
this makes me sad:
 when i was in high school (2013), a people from academy pilot selection came and talked me, that I need to take examination test, for pilot academy, so I. Went to the hospital and have a health test, and my health is good, then the next day I came to get the results, then I ask the doctor, that, how much does it cost, and the doctor said it’s around 40 rupiah, then I only have 20 rupiah, so i said ok, not today but next week i will pick it up, then I left the room, and walked while sad and little tears for not having that much money to pay, and then I saw a woman running towards me, and called my name, then I turned and saw that woman, was a nurse, and she comes with  a white bag plastic and she gives it, then she says, this is the result of your examination, I have paid the fee, you are young, one day you will be a great person, God bless. She said that, and she left, I just kept quiet, and just said many thanks, because, I was nervous, after that I went home and opened a plasticist, then there was a paper that said "I love, because life is love" then I cried but also happy because, the results were good and I graduated from pilot school. and then, now, as a pilot of Canada Airline, I work for ; Japan, Canada, USA, Mexico, and Brazil. this is, the thing of my life, great nurse, God bless that nurse 


This is my story
I didn’t cry, I personally think it’s a happy story! 😃
When you have crippling deppresion so you fell null

It's interesting what results show up first when you type: "this video will ..." Maybe there are people who don't long for just simple entertainment. Maybe it's deeper feelings that they used to feel as they were kids.
i almost cry but i didnt and i was trying to cry but i could not

LMAO cant stop laughing OMG this is sooo funny
There's actually a 6.87% chance that anything/anyone can make me cry. I am 13 anf I've already been through a lot. I know many people have been a lot, but I just don't know how long I can bear with this. I have never really got the chance to express my feelings even when I am alone. I don't even know how to express it anymore.
Btw Idk if my grammer is right b/c it seems a little wrong.
I did
I started crying at 46 second
If i see ssomething like this id always help them.

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The 2 k dislikes are dummy’s with no harts
Bawled like a baby. 10/10
:( This Is sad
I did not cry but this is sad
Case y’all didn’t get it, the guy who bought the little girl the cake as a young boy had a cake bought for him. Causing the guy as a grown man to do good deeds and buy the cake for the little girl. The man who bought the little boy the cake for his birthday, had a cake bought for him by the little boy but as a grownup. Moral of the story. Karma is a bitch, but what comes around goes around.
Like this comment if you cried
Not even sad. I proved you wrong bitch
God please  if someone  die bring everyone living 🙏🤲
am i the only one who wasnt close to crying
That’s so sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😪😪😪😪😪😪😪🥺🥺🥺😩😩😩😩😩😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪

If you didn’t cry your *heart not hold
If you didn’t cry you hold it is cold on the inside but hot on the outside.
If you cried that means you really are a kind,sweethearted and polite you always have feelings for people and what you do and what you accept. 
                   Bye

all I got from this is that this guy bought a little girl a cake he did because somebody did the same when he was a kid then the note the old man gave the kid/man ended up being the little girl's grandpa. No hate but I did not find this sad.

Ok so the first one is about a poor family trying to get by and get some food and stuff....
The total came out at 46.9 USD.
She had 2x20 USD notes and 7 USD in coupons yet she doesn't have enough money?
And what lemon cake costs 29 USD? (Or is that an American thing that I'm not aware of?)
Please help donate to the probable couse of the less unfortunate kids.https://www.gofundme.com/1otxs2ybyo

It’s much more sad when you personally know how it feels to be in the shoes of the kids, now looking back as an adult and how it puts my trivial issues into perspective. Poverty is a sad situation to be in

What the fuck that was easier than blinking how dafuq is that supposed to make you cry?
@blackpink blink Fuck you, assface.
BOOOOO
@blackpink blink Stop being so mean to me! I'm gay and I'm sensitive you homophobe!
Orange Woomy wow ur rude HAVE SOME RESPECT
maybe if it had a better script and better acting, it might have bee better
I’m sure sure whether it’s either:

A. I’m a terrible person
B. This is NOT sad AT ALL
C. There’s probably some kind of deeper meaning I don’t understand
D. This is more wholesome than sad
If I didn't cry or even tear up does that mean I have no soul?
Like if you didn't cry (IF YOU WANT!!!!) |
                                                                              v

And for those who want to be rude and generly just try to put others down can just go and stay away because I will not pt up with it! Also thanks for 1.2k!!!
@blackpink blink he said if you want
@Cosesa Niyonsenga How is that rude!?
@Cosesa Niyonsenga it's not rude it's just that some people can be affected more than others. 😉
I Cry tears that was very sad 😢  from  analyse
That's so rude
This is so stupid
riley cruz booooo maybe you didn’t understand it

I loved this what it is saying is that one day something good will happen someone will help another and expect you to keep it going this is the kind of people we need!
This is terrible. It's not even sad. It's just poorly  done. I'm not subscribing to you copying someone else's bad video

I actually saw this and looked interesting but the same thing happend to my cousins except the granpa wasn't him I cried god bless everyone

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!!!!!
I think their grandpa was the guy that helped the guy that helped them and then the guy that they met up with totally remembered this moment when their grandpa helped him and he then decided to help them after that heart warming momment
The grampa was the man who helped the guy when he was young and got hints the cakes
No crying to me

So happy I've already seen this, or else I would bawl my eyes out.
I was really happy for them, but idk why I didn't cry

I'm gonna crack like nobody's watching and eat like I skipped lunch. Why? Because Red Lobster's Crabfest is back. I'm diving into so much crab, so many ways. Like Crab Lover's Dream with luscious Snow and King crab legs and rich crab alfredo. Or, the Snow Crab bake. Who knew crab go's with everything? Whoever put crab on this salmon, that's who. With flavors like these, I'm almost too excited to eat! Hey, I said almost. Now that it's back, get crackin' while you still can.
Lol

Does this mean I have no soul?
okay so we know that the answer to the universe, life, and everything is 42 right? now if you add them (4±2) then its 6 now 6 (otherwise 666) is the number of satan, now lets talk about a triangle, it has 3 sides, 666 has three numbers, so a triangle is essentially 666 but if we uno reverse it 666 = a triangle (preferably  a regular one not a right or left etc) now the Illuminati is a triangle so the meaning of life is the illuminati but if you add a on to the end it spells illumination, illumination  is a company and their most well known movie franchise, is DM and also Minions, now push aside DM, and focus on the main 'lovable' characters the minions. each of them has either two or three eyes, but stuart is the main character in the movie Minions, now stuart is the main character too in the movie stuart little is a mouse, now mice lets do a plural noun, so two mice seven words all together as a sentence, michael jackson has seven letters in his first and last name, he had 6 labels which leads back to 666 sixsixsix has 9 letters total and michael was the 8th of 10 children in the jackson family if you subtract 6 and nine you get three and 8 - 10= 2 2±3 is five, In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine In 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.The following year, in 1965 Mar 21, Martin Luther King Jr. led more than 3,000 civil rights demonstrators on the 50-mile march to Montgomery from Selma.  Martin Luther king died 1968. if you add 19 and 68 you get 87 1987 is what we'll choose. Jan 26 1987 14th American Music Awards: Whitney Houston, Lionel Richie & Alabama, "Hello" is a song by Lionel Richie. Taken as the third single from his second solo album Can't Slow Down, the song was released in 1984. Singer Adele also made a song called hello. "Hello" is the sixth-most liked YouTube video by likes (14.40 million).  Ray Rice, former running back for the Baltimore Ravens, has a net worth of $14million. 1±4 = 5 leading us to michael jackson again or the jackson 5, adele's song hello has 5 letters too. so by process of elimination That means Michael Jackson is the answer to the universe, life, and everything.

They got me at the very end when they sang “happy birthday”
Noot ssd nub
😭 The ending got me...
It don't make me cry but I love the video
I am gonna cry
I'm not heartless for not crying. I just gave up a long time ago. To the point It became difficult to cry. What's scary is that I don't know when I'll cry or what will make me cry, because I don't like crying in front of others. This world is definitely not suitable or tolerable for the kind hearted. I don't know if there is another method, but I got rid of my kind heart by becoming mean cold and cruel. Because I can't tolerate heartbreak anymore, so I did that. Nobody stays good in this world.
I would cry if I still had emotions
Omg so the old one was the one who gave it to the Man who gave the girl a...ok i got confused XD
Who is the hail that disliked video
I didn’t cry. Lmao the topic lied jk lol
People who dislike these videos must not be human
Wow bro was really poor his whole life
Very sad Video!  Thanks.   To  Whom It May Concern,
Hey, you are brilliant!  You are attractive! The rest of your life is the best of your life! So, don't beat yourself up because a few idiots don't like you. You were created in the image of an ALMIGHTY God. He created YOU delightfully, fearfully, and wonderfully.  ”So do not let the evil voices snuff out your life by getting you to see only the debt, problems, and self-hatred. You are more than a conqueror. Life has ups and downs. Remember if you are at the bottom, you can only go up from here. Do not listen to the voice that suggests death. For death is not of God, it is a lie from the enemy to suggest a quiet place, a fiery grave. You were created to be happy, to live and if your life sucks right now, ask God to show you how to change things and he will. It won’t involve killing yourself, or anybody else, he will provide an escape from any situation. Ask Him and see what happens!
Wow😃😃😃!!!!
I didn't cry
I cried the second they couldn't afford the cake.

I’m crying😭😭😭
My name is jaime im 12 years old i was born and raised in galveston moved to houston, lived in missouri i am part Canadian part mexican(i don't have much of an accent) i have one sibling, a great and caring father and mother.my first elementary school  was called armstrong elementary. I have never been a talkative guy, i had good friends its just i never really talked much with them. I wasn't a straight A student i am a little over average on my grades. During this time my family owned a Chihuahua named toby.sadly it was between 5th and 6th grade when he got run over and crushed to death.  My middle school name was called cms(my family had been given the opportunity to raise another Chihuahua named max during that time) i had only stayed there for six grade but it was the best year ever i was praised for being very nice and nerdy.this was the year where i made friends with my homie yurias, a type of friend who would run a football field just to retrieve your school uniform. Surprisingly i had many good friends in six grade so i was sad to move to cleveland.before i moved my dog, max stopped eating and became sick. my family tried desperately to save him but he didn't survive the week. My parents found him dead the next morning outside our door. My mum had told us that he probably tried to say goodbye waiting at our door. His grave is stilI buried in the ground where we used to live.i Have managed to make it to 7th grade where i met more friends, one who is named adolfo(my neighbor) and another named daniel. Daniel is the type of innocent person who wouldn't get a dirty joke and adolfo would be the person to get the joke and follow it up with another funny joke. Since my family and i live in the country now there are more pests problem so we decided to get a pet cat named cheeto(cheto for short) i personally hated the idea but i slowly started to love him. I could tell him my problems and he would cuddle up in my lap and it felt like he was actually listening. my joy with him also ended when my family decided to go to houston for my gramps birthday for 2 days and leave cheeto alone in the trailer. When we came back i was ready to feed him but i couldn't see him in the trailer. My mum came into my room later while i was playing video games crying and said softly,they've killed him. I went outside and saw my pet's scratched up  corpse lying on the ground. He had scratched the rubber net on the open window and gotten out. It wasn't until i heard barking on the front lawn till i knew who it was. My neighbor's dogs had killed my cat. His death just reminds me that nothing is forever and that everything dies at some point.i am still currently in 7th grade and i am still friends with adolfo i just don't see him the same way anymore. I blame myself for not taking cheeto with me to houston. Right now it is almost summer and i just like to think all my pets are not suffering and in a better place.so that is most of my life right now. This is why i am depressed and try to drown it out with my addiction.


Keep moving forward

The loneliest people are the kindest, 
the saddest people smile the brightest, 
and the most damaged people are the wisest. 
All because they don't wish to see others suffer

Some people have tattoos.
Others don’t wear shoes.
The kindest people I know
are not afraid to show

all their colors boldly.
Though they’re greeted coldly
from narrow-minded folks

This just makes me soo happy and joyful and I teard up

Society is an embarrassment these days. This is humanity, true humanity. What God made us to be. This is what the world should be for but it’s a shame this isn’t reality and is just a film. Wish life was like this. A simple act of caring creates an endless ripple that comes back to you. Hope you guys have a brilliant life.

Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again. This is because if you carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you.
Bro not even
WHEN YOUR DROWNING IN HAPPY TEARS THAT YOUR BRAIN CANT WRITE A COMMENT

Guys why are you watching this video? YOU DO REALIZE THE UPLOADER IS STEALING VIDDSEE.COM'S VIDEOS.

Like my own comment cause everyone hates me
Stephen Powell 
Pathetic, you ask people to like your comment. Cheap way to feel good about yourself.

Plus, I don’t hate you. I just hate the fact that you write something so overused that on any video, you’re likely to see something either the same or directly related to the concept of asking for likes as a subject for a comment.
Definitely going to do this in the future to it's so kind
Me too this is the kindest thing anyone can do for anybody...
u know wut stop trying to get likes on your comment bitch

Hey! I know this is overrated but it's okay if you depressed, sad, or lonely, bullied, made fun of and tourtured. There's always someone there for you, somebody loves you, even if it's somebody you don't know! Stay in there! It'll get better. I know it cause I was there. Have a great day. 👍👍
Nice try but my heart is made of stone.
Irl? Mine is not...
Thanks i needed this
XOXADDD😩😩😩
This was the most innocent, pure and kind thing I have seen in a very long time. Yes I did cry and thank you for the reminder that not everyone is this world is cruel and hateful and that there are, although few and far between, people who care, people who love. People who are good. Thank you this at a point in my life where everythings a bit bumpy and difficult. Thank you.

Here is some info Incase you are not crying yet-
 One day we will all be dead, and all life in the universe will be gone, but trillions of years before that, nobody will remember you, not even your friends and family because they are all dead too, even if you are Pewdiepie, in 1,000 years, nobody will remember you.

Hmmm. I must be cursed with some demonic shit, beacuse I've been on the search for a video that can really crack my emotions, but nothing seems to work. Welp, I guess I'm immortal to sad stuff.
Zaki idk
Zaki search “feeding guinea pig to snake” in your search bar and click the top video.
Ok so I’m gonna give you a part of a video and if this does not make you cry then you are officially not human 
https://youtu.be/bezB5m0lxls
Skip to 8:00 in the vid
 Basically what is happening is that the girls mum have had a baby while they were at school and they literally had no idea their mum had gone into labour yet
And when their dad told them...

If you don't understand the story: When the Grandpa was younger, he's the one who helped the guy for his birthday when he was 7.  And when he read, "That comes back to you.", it did come back to the Grandpa because it was his birthday and he's the one who wrote the letter to the guy and the guy gave back the letter to him when he's now old. I don't know if you guys understand or not. 😅
Very sweet

fucking tear glands of steel

Its a little bit sad but i didn't cry i almost did
I cried..so much..that it broke my heart..so much that I can’t even control myself anymore...
Ya know, i cant understand why mankind cant be like this and everyone help each other in small ways even if it is just a cake or a scarf on a cold day. But the way we are programmed and how society is segregated by the elite.
 Well, its because they dont want us to get along with each other. Wheather it be race, color or even religion. That would go against their plan to control us. But we are getting smarter everyday. We are starting to realize that racisim along with other things are not something we need but something we choose. And with all the bad things that are accumulating in our society and the entire world. We really need to stop all the hatered and jelously whether the puppet masters like it or not. We need to start to wake up and start talking about how we as the human race are being manipulated into our personal thinking and how gullible they treat us and brain wash us with subliminal characteristics they put in our heads. Tell yur friends, tell yur family, tell the world. Life is just one big a circle. And we need to keep that circle moving without breaking its cycle. WE KNOW NOW! AND NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO CHANGE OUR WAYS OF THINKING. Thank you.

“I’m the man in the queue” walks out onto road- hit by bus- endless ripple-
Wtf 😂👌
Luke McGregor bro you have such a cold heart, I love it
Holy shit lmao. I’ve been out here trying to cry for the last 5 min and then I burst out into laughter after seeing this
Heeeeeeeedeeeeeeedeeededeeeee
Luke McGregor dudeeee. That’s dark asf
Only some people   Are so warm hearted 💕
im a really super emotional girl and I didn't cry at this story (I got a tiny bit teary but not one tear drop)
You are not a piece of paper. Don’t cut it. Your neck is not a shoe don’t tie it. You’re self is not a movie don’t let it end. You aren’t a book, don’t judge it. Sorry for making you imagine bad things :’(
Awww I feel bad but didn’t cry
People just good
Life lesson on money never yell at grateful parents writing this comment made myself cry cause I feel like I ask for too much so I’m going to stop asking for things.
A person who was generous.
A person who was kind.
A person who was patient.
And a person who would help.
I was.
I was that person. 
I was that person who will always be there to help, even in the cause of everything he has.
I was that person, who wanted to be good.
My parents would usually say, that this world is full of deceit. That people always used me. 
I never listened.
But you know?
They were right.
I was that person, who helped. 
And what I get? 
Taunts. 
Insults.
Loneliness.
Sadness.
Depression.
I gave my joy, my time, my kindness and my life for them.
They misused it.
They asked for more.
They didn't even think of it's worth.
They bullied me for my mistakes. 
For the times when I won't give.
For the times that I was "too selfish."

I was a good person.
I told myself I'm bad, because I just avoided someone's offer.
I criticized myself, even when I know it's not true.
I told myself to be better. To be more generous.

Now, I'm done with it.
With all of this things.
With all of my lies,
my masks,
my laughs,
and my "happiness".
Sure, I told them.
They said "it'll get better" or "Sorry for everything."
And sure, I forgave them.

What an idiot I was.

Those who I considered true friends, left me.
I see them laughing, having fun and being happy.
While the one who dedicated his time for others, to make others happy, just looked at them, outside those windows.
I thought I was needed.
I wasn't.

I just want to end this all.
that made me cry
Sweet lovely sad but dident cry sorry

Keep cried
I coldrnt to sad
I didn't cry
This just made me become a different person. I now won’t bother my amazing mom ever again because I know she doesn’t want to talk about it but I can tell that she’s struggling.
I get this the old man was the other guy that bought that other kid that cake. And the person who paid for the cake for the girl was the kid and he is older now and sharing the same thing.
Is it weird that I cried 1:33 minute
And I feel like running away to my dad even though it would take 18 days.
One sad story is that My parents are in a divorce. My dad left and my mom stayed. I wanted my dad to stay but he couldn’t. Once he left I was able to talk to him on my phone. But whenever My mom see me talking to him she says for me to ask him when are you going to send money I ask him all the time but he can’t. He is trying his best. He can’t come on Christmas because of work. He keeps on telling me before I go to bed just pendent I am right there next to you. He also says that I will see him soon but I have been waiting to see him but I never can. I Can’t see in person for a long time, Hopefully I can see him in person
I feel really sorry for u
@callum russo haha so true
Aiden Pearce least his dad could but unlucky for u coz I don’t think pussies can
@Grace Brown that's so nice you have my full respect now
@Aiden Pearce what went on in your brain that said this was ok that was extremely rude and you should never say something like that to anybody
OMG ITS THE SAME MAN
NO WAY NO WAY NO WAYYHYYYY y’all saw what happend?
Okay you got me👏
Some friggin how I didn't cry
i did not cry sorry try better
I did not cry but someday i will be like that but im seven i will be like that no matter what i will!!!
With his mom
The old man was the man that gave the kid a note
Wait so the Grandpa was the man in the que and the man when the boy was little and he grew up he did the same thing and the two never forgotten each other

I no cry
It didn’t cry but it was sweet
I cried

Like if you cried
Everybody is never to old or to young to help people... even though you dont have enough money

This video actually Made me a tear fall down... I love how people can be This kind




Story time: I was once 7 years old... we went to a park, there was something you can win a doll with, only we didnt had enough money to play the game... then my mom and dad tried to cheer me up, so went to something else, a man noticed I wanted the doll so bad...but I didnt let that show and tried to cheer up, I moment later the same man came up to me with the doll, and gave it to me, he sayd: “take good care of it, its for you”
I sayd thank you... as useal my parents asked the man for hes aderess to pay the money back, he noted on the paper hes phone number. And after i’ve never heard of him againg

Now that i’m 15 I did the same to a younger kid...but they didnt gave my money back, I didnt care at al, I was just happy I could help someone.


I just like my OWN comment ;-;
Erika Roels nice story
Emo alert
I would always help someone or a homeless person and give them money whenever I can because I care about people and I hope this inspires u to help people to

So your saying that after that old man gave that kid a cake, he went home and researched as hard as he could to find the name of the old man and then creepily stalk his family to see if they couldn't afford a cake and then when they couldn't afford a cake he bought it for them and gave them a cryptic name and piece of paper? Wow when you spin it like that it makes it kind of creepy 😂 This is all a joke I loved the video

EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS !!
The story almost had me in tears
i did not cry but it was good
Didn't  cry

This is how world should have been
I legit cried bc this is legit me irl bc i am poor and thats what happened and i wanted a toy and my great grandma could not afford it then the person behind us got it for us
I understand the sadness of the video, but a little girl not getting what she wanted in the store (In the beginning.) Is not sad, just because she doesn't usually get anything special because the're poor, doesn't mean they should have it.
Waaaaaaa
Aww omg im sorry for the grandma
I didn’t cry
I love it  I was about to cry
I'm not crying there's just somthing in my eye
Sad but I didn’t cry
The last bit got me
I cried before it even started...I tried to be quiet so my mum didn’t hear me crying 😭😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢
I started to cry omg bye
I didn’t cry at all
It sounds like the man said a simple act of caring creates an endless nipple
The girls face is so funny
It doesn’t get what their  saying
When I put the subtitle on, its sooooo funny
I didn’t Evan cry
IM NOT CRYING, ITS JUST SWEAT FROM MY EYES
I didn't cry because of this. Yes, it was sad,  but it's really cliche in all the "try not to cry" videos. Here are a few suggestions when uploading try not to's.
1) Don't say 100% will
2) Don't say "HARDEST"
3) Try not to make it like every other try not to's. Especially when it's a try not to cry. Try to upload a sentimental story. Perhaps about loss, regret, or whatever floats your boat into the tears of other people. 
-
Don't come at me for having an opinion and suggestions on how not to be cliche. Being cliche isn't all that bad, but it the sake of the title.....
so heartwarming and sweet
I have no soul..not a single tear was shed
HOW AM I NOT CRYING 🥺🥺🥺 SERIOUSLY IM NOT
meh... I don't cry because I'm *STOIC* a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining.
Cute so hounering but I did not cry

Hi, Phil Swift here with Flex Tape! The super-strong waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal! Imagine everything you can do with the power of Flex Tape!
TheWalnut I hate you 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@Kittymon 。・ω・。 yes ma'am

That's the Excatly the same thing I did, an elderly Indian couple was short on tomatoes  and lettuce, so I told the clerk I'll  take that,the couple was bagging their groceries and I gave them the tomatoes and lettuce, and they thanked me touching their chest as if to say from my heart, and that made me feel better giving then getting.
That is so nice!!
JOE KING Ah, that's good to hear that it happened to you too. *sobs* That was so touching. *sigh* I do wish that there were more of those kind-hearted people and that would made me very happy. *smiles* Thanks for sending this comment.

Was the little girls grandpa the man of queue for the other guy?
A depressing story of a person who couldn't get their cake
One of my classmates is the opposite of that man, I wish they would be like him someday...
I didn't cry oof
after the young boy said " im the man in the queue" i knew exactly what was going to happened so i cryed
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I cryed my heart out
I wish every day that happened to everyone
Beautiful story, always help someone in need when you can.

Awww❤️❤️❤️
I was crying cause i haven't heard of my grandma after she came to visit....im really worried
I'm not crying😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 YOU ARE
nice vid but I didn't cry
Me too
What’s up
When ur not that old u cry
When I had my fingers amputated, on two separate occasions at the hospital, I paid for two older men to afford a cab ride. When children in line in front of me couldn’t afford the candy they were trying to purchase, I paid for it. I have given homeless people free will to buy whatever they wanted at the store instead of giving them money.
I lost my wife 20 years ago, and then my son six years ago. I’ve been alone all that time and unemployed. Tonight a person I barely know invited me for Thanksgiving dinner. That was the first holiday I’ve had somebody to spend the evening with in over 10 years.
The only favour I’ve ever asked is to pass it on.
Isn’t that what we’re supposed to do?
Once again, Namjoon. Stop it.
Soo sad
Wait does anyone realize that the grandpa was the original man in the thingy
I’m not crying you’re crying!!
Its just the onions
is it bad that i didnt cry
bearservetea - yeahhh thats very accurate I’ve always had a fragile heart
No🤣🤣
No it’s bad that I’m crying of laughter at 3:35
Nah you just win
Bella Machan-Dixon no because I didn’t 😂
I’m ABUSTOULSY crying
okay this is sweet but the actors can't act, seems so fake and scripted tbh, no offense tho loved the video
So fking hard to cry its so beautiful
my heart......
This did not make me cry but good video
😣😭😢😩😦🙁😔
How am i soposed to cry when the girl makes faces like this 3:37😂😂
Who are the 507 cunts who disliked



Nevermind their Chinese thats why
Best video ever watched if only the world was like this
I wish there was more kind people in this world.
I am triggered I wanted to very and I was like less that 1 minute away from it
I cried so much this was so sad 😢
lol i just laughed
When I saw the grandpa’s face I knew that the tears would come😭😭😭
My eyes didnt even get watery 😂
its cute, but not enough to make me cry
This isn’t sad it’s showing the kind things people do to others that aren’t as rich as them
oof this broke me
i like this vid  but not even one tear came out of my eye
Why all these sad videos have to be Chinese
man guys you gotta watch out for these ninjas chopping them onions.








*Internal Screaming.*
I didn't cry just teaching me a lesson in life to share kindness

I remember my grandparents  I only meet  one of them but  others I didn't meet if only I meet them. 😢😢😢😢😢😢  I CRIED SO BADLY.
I wasn’t even sad at all...
kawaii.. but I didn't cry all I feel is happiness and a bit of sadness...… T^T
When I realized the original man on the queue was him, my eyes went oof
I believe in good karma like this :)
Like my dad once said, 'you get back what you give' 😊
This is very touching, but I don't find it sad. No, sad is when your best friend since you were a kid dies. This is happiness in a bottle.
Me rn 😢😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The title of this video was not incorrect.
Sad
1 act of kindness =more positive than negative now help when you could and don’t give up on your dreams
This just gave me a feeling of hope. no crying here
sad then happy sad again

Mom;are u cryin?

Me;NO, IM NOT

Mom; whats that then?

Me; mY FACe

Mom; no thats tears, hun u need to learn more at school.
He was...paying it forward 😭
Why do all of the try to not cry videos have to be made in Japan?
OMG SO THE GRANDPA WAS THE DUDE THAT HELPED HIM
i realy like the video😀
Techanically, The man who paid for the cek gave the money back to the Grandpa.
umm really liked that videos idi not cry its a little funny with those drep face the kids were making
okay wait does that mean the Grandpa went almost bankrupt, so he couldn't support his family anymore? Why did he lose his money? or did the frikin cake use up all of it? Good message but also unlikely.
Our world gets worst every year but we don’t understand how great full we are to have enough to have a roof over our head
clickbait

Dear person reading this I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better. You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. I know you may feel unimportant or insecure at the moment but know that you are a beautiful human being inside, outside and you are important.

i dont find it sad.. you never see this stuff happening in real life
I saw a man at the medicine shop saying..."How much do 4 pills cost",and after hearing the cost he said.."I'll just take.2"
Had something like this happen to me. My family had the money but my mom and dad had been real upset and I was having a nervous breakdown because my mom was being very very unpleasant towards me. This guy just played for us in advance, it made my mom ne a tad nicer and we didn't have to spend more money...
My mom forgot to get the ice cream so a man went to get it for us......but my mom still had to pay😂

Tired of feeling like I try but you don’t care
Tired of feeling like you lie when you say you swear
Tired of feeling like a cheat when I play fair
Tired of trying to make you mine cause I don’t share

Spilling confessions
She feeling so guilty
Telling me everything
Might as well as kill me
Say that you loved me you didn’t really
Congratulations you made me look silly
I thought I knew you
But I was so wrong
Where did you go
Where have you gone
I think I’m losing
The pain is so strong
Stuck in a place
I do not belong
I got depression
Don’t think I can trust
Don’t wanna leave you
But I feel like I must
I’m by myself now
I have to admit

Tired of feeling I try but you don’t care
Tired of feeling like you lie when you say swear
Tired of feeling like a cheat but I play fair
Tired of trying to make you mine cause I don’t share

I don’t really wanna live in this lifetime
I don’t really want a life that’s like mine
I don’t really wanna cry but I can’t lie
I don’t really want a life that’s not mine...
Tell God You can be good GOD SAID I BLESS YOU ALL AS WELL

and people is trying to be nice someadays dont worry everyone theres alot of people around you that can help

their should be more people like this but today every one is so controlled by the way they act and look its makes them selfish monsters that are lying on the outside to have more friends
SAK122707 see your someone who understands our world today it's mostly about popularity and money looks boyfriend's and all this crap that isn't even important it's how you dress and how you treat others look at those girls on tv their boobs or but or even both are fake I swear they are going to kill themselves with all that. and men just go for fake girls when they can have the real thing half the damn time
:)
SAK122707  yeah honestly I wish girls would stop getting butt injections and breast implants because they are ruining their body that God gave them I swear girls these days want to look good it's the way they act that counts
Sonya Hayes your true because there’s a girl in the school who’s from the hood btw I know she probably isn’t and because she acts like that she acts like she’s rich so she gets more friends and its kinda annoying
awww so cute so sad but true
You call that sad?!!
I may be missing something here, Which point was I supposed to cry at?

PLEASE READ❤️❤️❤️There is someone that loves you more than anyone who knew you before he formed you in the womb and that's God when Adam and Eve sinned against God sin came in and brought death which would lead you to hell and from the love of my heart and God heart do not Go there so this became a problem because GREAT many were in hell than in heaven because of sins So God with LOVE and MERCY sent his Son Jesus Christ to the earth as a man to die on the cross for our sins he got whipped so hard in the back that the whip stuck onto his flesh he did that for you on the cross they nailed in his hands and feet with pain and he did that for you,for us,for the world For God so love the world the he gave his one and only son whoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life  
The term believes is meant to serve him obey him sin it you're life to him and love him with all thy heart soul strength and mind and body but after he did on the cross for your sins he rose up from the dead because he was sinless and defeated death he is now in heaven watching you with love he is coming soon to take his followers to heaven for ever while people left behind will surfer badly And one more thing satan is real he is a great deceiver he deceived one third of angels in heaven and wants to destroy your soul in hell so bad that there will be extreme pain with NO MERCY so please ask God your self to be real to you and be baptised of water and you must receive the POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT who will guide you and always repent with LOVE FOR GOD IS LOVE

A Simple Act Of Caring Creates An Endless Ripple. Grandpa is the one who gave the cake to the boy. Then the man gave them the cake for Grandpa’s birthday.
I cried because it was a great act of generosity
It's loving can't stop crying
you have to help and share
Agreed with Savanah
The younger man in the queue was HANDSOME....Ooof 

I was like "Noooooo he should have said his name, bit then again it wouldn't be a mystery if he had"
Dis is so sad
I DONT CRY
i didnt cry ......i cried soo loud
Anyone else notice the grandpa is the guy that brought the birthday cake for the boy and the boy brought the cake for the girls grandpa and that’s grandpa is the one that gave the cake to the little boy
Next time if your going to say it’s going to make you cry make sure it will or people will call it clickbait and you don’t want that do you

i didn’t cry but i found this so sweet❤️
Sad but no cry
Not cry
I didn't cry , but I think this show us how people should be.
Created by me 
"A lot of people are homeless when they are 26 or older or younger, Giving to them gives them an idea to give to more people, giving money to them helps them to live there lifes, not live as a homeless until you die.
God gave us life and we have to work hard on that life so we can experience the world and we can die calmely knowing "I have experienced God's creation"
I didn’t cry but it just melts my heart that some people in the world can be so nice and caring
I didn't cry it was a good small movie tho
No sad
i thought there would be endless backstories
incredible
Not sad AT ALL
I never cried man but really sad.

lissen as i was 13 i was drawing on a painting for an art  for the school i was traing to win  a prize to travel  to an art gala and i had the chance to win the teacher took my art and told me that i will know did i won the travveling to the gala adn they told me that i didnt won i was really sad because i spend colors and time on it and at least i find out that they took my art and told the pople of the gala that the art isnt mine the teacher told them its from someon else so that person TOOK MY ART AND TRAVELED TO THE GALA AND HAD THE GLORY WITH MINE ART. i was doing all the work and at the end  they have the FUN and i do all the work they have funn and travvel to 3 differend islands of croatia  and i was sitting at home .... isnt taht sad,,,,,
Well, i should've cry. But, i loved it!
I can relate tbh It's a hard life out there because not everyone can have all the money they ever wanted and I understand this is so heart touching to me because I been at the place where my family couldn't buy that much because my dad was a drug  abuser and he would never help pay the house rent my mom had to do all the work and she's only 33 at that time I remember my mom would always tell me to be thankful of the food I eat and to say thank you for the things I receive this video made me cry so much its inspiring how one person could make a difference in someone's life

Me and my mom went to the store once to get some snacks for mother daughter movie night and the man in front of us was having trouble. He said his bank account had 7,000 dollars in it so he didn't understand why it wouldn't work. My mom interrupted the man behind​ the the counter and said "Excuse me, are you having trouble paying for this?" The man, embarrassed said "Yes Ma'am." And looked down. My mom said "what's wrong'' The man looked up at her and said "I don't know Ma'am." He said "My card must be acting up"  My mom said "I'LL  COVER IT THEN!" And gave the man the money. I love mum mom

Very sweet but did not cry.I am numb that's why
you guys cant seriously be that prideful to say whether you cried or not? Just take the damned message to heart, this is supposed to advise you to be generous, not make you cry.


sorry, but i feel like it is out of place when people are like, "i didnt cry". Maybe it makes me sound sensitive, but all im hoping is that people are thinking about the lesson and not the fact that theyre proud they didnt cry.

Eh. Have a good day lol
ooғ- ι crιed. ;v;
"100% sure you will cry after watching this video" at the start:I can take that challenge. after watching it: I CANT EVEN STOP A TEAR IN THIS VIDEO

People stop saying you didn't cry just to be someone special
But we didn’t. It was sweet, but I didn’t cry
They can’t be special just because they said they didn’t cry? That’s messed up. Or is it because you cried and yet you feel special. Eh... whatever.

Do something nice for someone today. As a girl who grew up in a home with not much money, I relate to this so much. I cried when the man gave the little girl the cake. It just shows than humanity hasn't completely gone to hell.

Whats to cry about

Me : I'm not ready
I'm scared
Gummy Jimin me too 😭
Cooming soon...
Think before you say “ban the immigrants”. They have been through hell.
Pls say me that first one and this isnt real it is filmed right?
Like I care cuz there's nothing I can do anyways
i will give as much support
I know that there's nothing I can do about this problem, but my heart still breaks. I'm really lucky that I grew up without worrying if I'd live to see tomorrow. I wish peace was possible, but at this point, there's no way that'll happen.
That is a great child actor tho
Awesome. This needs to be a video game.
OMG, for a second I thought she was going to end up like that little Syrian boy - dead on the beach.
Let’s pray for those children out there who go through so much. I can’t believe people joke about that stuff.
Joking about tragedy does more good than prayer, which does nothing.
I would've just pumched the lady in the face and held onto the kid
I NEED MOREEE
When did American democracy come
When Russia is done having fun :)
What scares me for some reason is she has the same phone as me.
0:35 - You’ve only got enough for one. Man war stinks.
I enjoy the suffering even if its just acting.
Oh jeez, where is this taking place?
Какое милое лицемерие: взорвать Ближний Восток ради грабежа нефти, а потом зазывать с американских и британских сайтов беженцев и террористов - в Германию, сочиняя для тупых европейцев такую жалостливую рекламу. А обвинять во всех бедах всегда можно Россию! Супер твари! Меняете местами причину и следствие!
0:20 Are these rescuers or invaders?
Rebels.
Invaders
Omg she’s off call the midwife she plays the little girl Belinda in season 5😂
I wonder how the camera man is doing.
It 2019 and she's 21 now..
Girl: I'm not getting on the boat without you!

Me: that just breaks my heart
I wish that I can help those people 😢.
Что за фильм?
Angle of the north there
I searched up crappy 3 second video and this came up
The last of us megaremastered.

i think...
@the serpent YEAAAH looool
Like these are cutscenes from an awesome video game! Play as a refugee and survive in part 1 then part 2 is a walking simulator to get to Germany.
Maybe it's time to back to shock value. Tell the truth and the ugly in a way the world will embrace
Is this second a day 2
It's just acting
It's just acting
It's just acting
It's just acting
It's just acting
It's just acting
It's just acting
It's just acting
the serpent yes ik, i mean that THIS video is acting
It’s real boi, this is the Syria War and migrant crisis.
It can be happening every day
this is a good idea for a war movie about syrian refugee
My class watched this and everyone started crying and now we are trying to raise money for homeless and refugees
Now watch the beginning of the first video...
This is what would happen is the IRA had more power probably
I wish I could help them
This is so sad
the worst ..im heart broken...i pray my success so i can save children....
My teacher showed my class this but It never made sense to me now rewatching it again it made me cry 😭
Imma sound a bit mean buuut... where’s part three
1:20 😢😢😢😢😢
Ok but this some good acting ngl
My tears are flowing freely no child deserves this. Deserves to mature in this way. I'm so mad I can't do anything but only cry for her 😭 😭
Nice Dutchmans...
Did that guy just call that girl scum :(
Many people are angry at refugees because they feel tricked by the media  for painting them all as victims of war. Some refugees have even murdered people in the safe nations.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-attacks-germany-migrant-idUSKCN1040SF
Regardless of your feelings on the real life situation, you can't deny that this is a powerful video, even today. What I don't see many people comment on is the incredible resolve and determination the girl has. She just keeps _losing_ and _losing_ as they travel further across the borders to seek refuge but that doesn't stop her. After losing her father, she still keeps going with her mother. Once she is separated from her mother on that boat, she puts all of her strength into protecting that boy. It's only once _he's_ gone too that finally gives into despair, but I feel like she will continue to fight for a life worth living.
You should act in a film because good actors or it might be real ??
Does anyone know which country this is taking place in? And what the conflict/war is? I want to look more into it.
@the serpent what's that? have any links or something?
Germany soon if they continue open door migration policy.
It’s fake, it’s to give people an idea of the war happening in Syria
Only We Focest On This Than Memes :(
If this is a movie iwill watch it
I call dibs on adopting her
Im so angry why that is happening
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War
GERMANS RIGHT!!!???
@Jordan P lol
No just humans
Looks like the same thing that’s happening in England is happening in France too in this video
How i fell about the sad kids of there parents who sacrificed for them only  kids. kids can make there own future not there parents. that's why they help and care for there child you people think of the future and not the money surviving is better then money
I know this might be silly but is this actually real footage?
the serpent hey I know the video itself is probably produced but if this is reality it’s horrible. I can’t even begin to imagine.
Yes it’s real. The migrant policies in Europe have led to this.
No it’s fake
It 20% probability to survive the sea man
This is so sad are they go through a nuclear war or something
No this is giving developed countries an idea of war happening in the third world
When he said he wants his mommy and daddy I was broken 🥺🥺😭😭
The worst is happening with the Syrian children...
These videos have been my favorite videos on YouTube for many years. Not because I get to laugh at this but because it shows the truth bout our generations changing and about how your entire life can take a completely different turn in a matter of seconds. Like Chloe D recently said, I hate seeing this happen while not having anything to do about it. Though I am not in a good mental place in life at the moment, I am extremely grateful I am in a more safe environment. Again, It’s extremely scary. This morning I went to Walmart to get stuff for lunch, and my father was holding me close and said, “Maybe I should just hold you tight” I asked him why and he told me that yesterday, one of my closest friends almost got kidnapped at a Walmart about 30 minutes from where I live. He told me she was holding her mother’s hand and a man started to stroke her hair and immediately grabbed her by the arm. Fortunately, she was saved. “He’s all I’ve got left” broke my heart like Hxney Bee said. In the video, she holds fliers for a missing dad (most likely her own), she later on loses her mother because they can’t go on a boat together, and then reunites with either her brother or another lost child. Please stay safe! 🤍
The GIRL = 100,000's growing up in TENTS in Jordan Lebanon even Syria just waiting for someone to replace the monster Assad with a smoking 20-meter crater.
Yes we do need to save em  boys but they not coming here illegally
The truth of the world
I'm actually sad watching this because there's nothing i can do:(
stel je nie zo aan man
You should do part three
Part three
Part threeeeeee
0:07 hi sorry but that book is so good
My god.. I thought this was something completely different. Okay don’t be mad but. The girl looks like she was from the movie Logon. So I thought this was a continuation of the movie. And this was some trailer or something.
1:21 good thing I survived all of this war
The fact ppl can treat children that bad MAKES ME F%#*N SICK TO MY STOMACH!!! Damn those evil ppl to hell Lord plz! Plz make them burn n give those babies a good family! Plz.
This makes Me So Sad And Discusted That People Have To Live Like This It Is Not Right ;(
Is it okay that I’m crying right now?
This shits becoming a saga now
War is the lowest and sinfull act of humanity
Girls watching this: 😭😭😭😭 OMG THIS IS SO SAD 😭 

Boys watching this: 😂😂😂😂 this is completely a joke 😂😂😂😂😂
Sexist Dick
This girl has the same birthday as me
This is like Clementine and A.J from Walking Dead.
.........
I can't...
Hmm..
*hes all ive got left*
Save the children...
*And she still can’t get off her phone*
Because without it there’s no GPS and no way to contact her guardian again! Nothing about likes on Instagram.
0:30 JAKE PAUL
This video shows how young people are strong. Even through loosing their parents, they don’t give up. Us humans are destroying this earth. Killing millions leaving kids just like her on their own. No family no help. We need to act!
The way she kissed the little boy...
does the refugee crisis happens with bombs and shooters everywhere?
second a day and in the part where she falls on the water she spends 3 days in it??
No refugees in Greece
Smart Greece! 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-attacks-germany-migrant-idUSKCN1040SF
I’ve watched this video 10 times and I cried every single time
This is so sad...
FREE PALESTINE
Never
Because of greed and politics, it is innocent people that are suffering...
How humans change disgusts me.
The world is gonna be destroyed because of all. But people still beg for likes. I see humans but not humanity.
@Jordan P So true. Today's world is really different.
BadGirl Gamer it’s life
@Jordan P It's sad
Cool
....💔....
And people think it’s a joke. She lost her dad!!
How did this girl survive all this. And this is the kind of world we live in now. This thing deserves the best and all she gets is the worst. I hope she is ok and all of this is just a setup to show what world we live in
It is a set up the video is fake but based on what’s happening at Syria
I remembering seeing this video when I was younger and I was scared
Is it just me or I hear "Go, bitch!" at 1:14
I can’t believe that 4 million people have watched this, it’s being talked about so much, and it still happening. It’s like all we do are for nothing, it makes me feel trapped.
It’s almost like talking does nothing!
Nothing will ever stop war
This could happen...

Any


*Second*
Don’t build the wall removed trump
the serpent tell that to the covenant
Build the wall and re-elect Trump.

I almost fainted watching this😰
My name is Lilly and it just made it a whole lot sadder

I feel so bad about all the stuff these poor kids have to go through... 
　(இдஇ; )

Forget about laws and let everyone in because children
Now i get it
Okay
It’s based on the war in Syria

aw
When the security guard at area51 asks if me and the bois are with them 1:20
Esto es de verdad dimelos en los comentarios o es una pelicula
The girl ha St he same birthday as me
There’s something really subtle about both these ‘Shocking Second a day’ videos. They’re set in Britain. In the first one there’s hints, the English accents, school uniform, there’s the BBC news on the TV, then there’s the the London Eye, Gherkin and Shard smoking in the background. In this one, there’s the Angel of the North and the ‘No English’ signs. When I first saw these I thought they were set in Syria. But they’re not. It makes sense, as the message of the first one was, “Just because it’s not here, doesn’t mean it’s not happening”.
It's not subtle it's blatant propaganda
*slow clap*
She noob.
This literally displays the lives of Syrian who have fled the war in their countries and have to seek refuge in other places..
Here’s part 3


https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-attacks-germany-migrant-idUSKCN1040SF
*slow clap*
She is so beautiful i wish i had a gf like her
She’s like 16
I could donate all my money to save them! Like if you would do the same!!😭❤️
this makes me cru
Is that a real video?
No
Fact: kids at palestine are having hard times like this, and israel soldiers are actually killing the poor KIDS (not trying to be rude, its actually true)
Sad
0:31 omg I got so scared
The last of us 3 confirmed
Since I’m only 13, I can’t really do anything, and it really bothers me. For people who are over 18, get your ass up and start helping already!
stranger mxlyssa well there’s nothing. It’s leaders of countries at war with places like Syria. Nothing will stop war and fighting. It has been going on with the start of civilisation and as technology continues to advance it just gets more and more dangerous. Nothing will ever stop this people can only support the people involved.
The Doctor tell me p l e a se
What do you think helping involves exactly ?
I cried!
I watch the first one. didnt read the channel name so when I heard explosions and all that I thought it was a zombie apocalypse and I was like wow this is a good until the end.
I’ll pray for now that’s all I can do right now 😭 I’m crying
Oh motherf*ck3r This video represent the society of the world what the hell
I do think this is fucked up, but I kinda want this into a movie.
CRY
Im sorry i know this is a serious video but the small boy sounded like peppa-
Its so sad the fact that peoples have a similiar experience with this one, yet when they got to a save place some peoples yelling at them "Leave our country you immigrants ! Stop destroying our country !"
Gee, I wonder why?


https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-attacks-germany-migrant-idUSKCN1040SF
Her acting is so good. Wow
US is an expert at making this happend.
Anti-Americanism is a disease. The Syrian War did not start by the US.
Chile what?
This is depressing!!
This is not even close to sad oogway sacrafice for soul stone is sad
What’s going on?
StoryTime :3 yeah lol
Oh
Oh
The war in Syria
Make a third one and I’ll donate $1,420.69
Not very charitable of you
When he said I want my mummy and daddy I started bawling
This is so heartbreaking 💔
Is she ok now
Nope she’s dead
And this is how World War 3 Started
Scriptters that’s the message the charities video is trying to get across!
Woah, that is very depressing!
No this is nothing that dramatic. This is what’s happening in places like Syria right now.
IF I EVERYONE SAW THIS GIRL, I WOULD ASK, DO FINGERS TASTE GOOD
0:09 OMG EWWWWQWQWWWWWWWW THAT LOOKS SO DISGUSTING AND EMBARRASSING, EWW WHY IS SHE BITING HER NAILS, EWWWW THAT MAKES ME SO SICK, BUT GOOD THAT HER PARENTS DIED

U CAN EVEM HEAR A SQUIRT BECAUSE SHE LIKING THEM NAILS
You're a preppy bitch that bullies kids aren't you, you don't have to reply I already know you are but you don't want to admit it do you, yeah bitch I see the type of person you are the next time you leave a comment like this on any video think of this reply
This world sucks. 
Please God, send that damn asteroid!!!!
If I’m gonna adopt someone I’m making sure I’ll adopt their sibling too
Yes there needs to be more people like u

These are so sad 😭
Merry crist- *جججاھھھسھھھسھجنما!!!!!*
¿Esto paso de verdad? O es solo una muestra de lo que podria suceder? Ya que hay una camara que muestra escenas 
Youtube me recomendo este video de *2016* aca en 2019🤦‍♂️
I literally thought that this was a zombie apocalyptic movie...😮😲
If life is a zombie apocalypse movie than yes it is
She is so cute... it's sad to think all of this is happening...
Lmao I love how they use a white girl to represent a refuguee.
@Bäřty Bøy No? I find it funny that the producers of this video used a white person to  represent a refugee
Wtf? 70% of all refugees are come from South Sudan, Afghanistan and Syria, Myanmar, Somalia, Congo, Sudan, Iraq, Eritrea and the CAR
But of course you pathetic idiots think that some white 1st world country is sufferring from refugees?
Lmao? you think kids living this type of life is funny
Caucasians are refugees to
this is racist as hell

fuckinf disgusting
I'm so happy the comments aren't disabled here
Its like the last of us but not at all
This could definitely turn into a really good movie to be honest
That sad
How do they made this??
Aw I remember seeing this on Instagram it was so emotional 😭
This is a powerful message and I’d love to see this as a actual movie.
i wish this was a movie 😢
Video:** released 3 years ago**


Everyone in the comment section:  **3 days ago**
It doesn't really matter here..
That's not even what matters
You can't talk when your comment was made 2 days ago
This stuff can not be happening now! America would step in... right?
They have. That’s why we are at war with Syria. This what this video is based on ... the war in Syria and places like it
Is this a movie?? This is literally great! well not great but you know what i mean
this is what happening to syrian kids right now
I want to know what happens next
This made me wanna cry, but I suck them tears UP!
😭
SIGUE ASI Y EVITAREMOS ESTA MIERDA
This movie makes you think about how lucky you are and how horrible life could be and how horrible it is for people in war torn countries
Lol
Why dislike?
1:2

WHY DID SHE TAKE HER BROTHER BUT NOT BOTH OF THEM SHE NEEDS A HOME TO!!!!
I remember seeing this on tv. I was like 5 so didn’t understand what the hell was going on
We have the say birthday... only I'm 2005.
“He’s All I’ve Got Left”

My heart: *Shatters*
My eyes: *Crying*
what so, what exactly is happening? like a war? or something I don't get it
It’s based on the war in Syria. But from a point of view of a developed country. This is the second part.
That’s a good camera
XD
It gets even more depressing every second, thats why its so sad and tearful
k lmao
I never cried like this before...
Okay.. this broke my heart. But if they just chased this poor girl with a camera.. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
It definitely is
Chelsea Fung 
IT BETTER *B E*
This is an actress
Awwwn .... CuTe
Like il you hate War

I'll only like it if you edit it and make it say "like if you hate me" if it says like if I hate you, I'll definitely hit the like button
No begging in this vid
Who ever likes this video=1 war stopped
Is the girl really experiencing this
Yes. This is a preview for the new Disney princess movie.
No
This is so sad and awful, what happened to this girl 😣
What the 😮😮😕😕🙁🙁😟😟😔😔😣😣😖😖😖😢😢😢😭😭😭
:'( ''He's all i've got left''
My heart broke.
We need a 3rd one😭
War eather ends lives or breaks them
*Damn this is just sad* ...
OK SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE SAYS "Its your bithday! make a wish" I START CRYING AND FELLING PAIN
What if i was in her position? T_T
@Lisa Cans Pars I SEE WHAT TYPE OF PERSON YOU ARE YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH LISA YOU'RE A BITCH
@Lisa Cans Pars YES DUMBASS WE HAVE TO HELP THE CAUSE
@Bäřty Bøy therefore we have to care 4 people who are affected by major calamities even though we are not in (her/his) position, right T_T
There are only a few things we can do against it, but politicians and others, with great power could, but they don't
haha nice comedy video
A shame that all ONG'S just steal money, because if this kind of shitty organization can't do anything to change, basicly is because they don't do anything or a very poor amount of things. So many ong's exists, and this situation is getting bigger and bigger.

Theres very much cases of childrens suffering like Africa for example or the kids in the station of Lelingradski and more. Stop stealing money across people suffering, you are the real cancer of this worod exactly like powerful people.

Wanna help that people? Adopt those childrens by travel to those lands by yourself.
Thank you YouTube you bring me here
Why i hate human beings damn even "animals" know better

Chill
Poor kid
Self video
True action
Is this what ww 3 looks like?
Michael I know :/
@Jordan P damm it pretty terrible too see that this kinda missebale still happens on earth makes me sad too think about it
Not really this is what war looks like in Syria
I’m confused. She’s British. It’s a good country. Why is there war in Britain? Please don’t get mad because I am wrong just calmly explain how I am wrong. No matter the circumstances it is sad that people who can’t have children adopt young children and not teens. No one cares for teens like her...
True. Save the children foundation made this video to show British people and the world the life people have in places like Syria. As if to say just because it isn’t happening here doesn’t mean it isn’t happening there
I hope at least one of her parents survived
can someone really make a movie over this ??? pleasseee ???
")
i remember watching this ages ago
its still so sad man
I know this is and actress but I still feel so sad 😞
0:29 JAKE PAUL??!?!?
this one and the first one made me cry like im like how do these make me cry how
Sad just sad 
Whatever I say about war here is a story that happens that is true I dont remember exsaced words but here

Story

Mom: what?!

Me: *crying* ITS JUST THE WORLD DEATH. WAR

mom: that happend along time ago

Me: *in my head* *crying* I am bot talking about that.......

*Arguing more* 

and she might think there is no war but there is and she mabey thinks I am talking about past but no
I have depression because of things Deaths of animals that I loved and. Truth I had to figure out like a puzzel
This of course is all acting, yet for some reason everything feels so real... despite someone being there recording her every second through a camera; seeing the things happen around her.
I remember the first video they did with this girl and her story. When i saw the first one, It broke my heart. But I still believed things would get better for her... Now here I am, watching it get worse, watching her loose everything.
It may just be a video... But it video showing the real world. While we sit in the comfort of our homes while other are in the same place as her.
I heard a baby cried and I think the baby died which is sad
Like if god should save these people even the babies that are dying, this is so sad
Are you stupid you can't ask God for a chance now everything is already ruined
Stop begging for likes. That makes no sense
Me: *how does she record this-*
Other people: it's a reference to what's actually happening.
Me: *I didnt know she lived in Chernobyl, I'm sorry*
Other people:Its in Syria. 
Me: *Siria Smith? Oh yeah we went to the same classroom last year.*
Other people: . . . . The heck is wrong with you-
I hate how everybody acts like they have depression for a minor inconvenience when they have a home, a family, food, water,
depression has been growing in 1st world countries because the constant stress and competition for jobs and colleges. people in 3rd world are content even when theyre poor. but in somewhere like america, if you stoop low you stay there
Here come the waterworks
It makes me cry everytime she looks at the camera at the end and you know that shes wishing for the war to end...
There’s a few countries That are still in War And it’s shocking that I can’t do nothing
this would be a lot painful if the girl had a dog and lost him :(
We found a home for ( idk his name)


Me:that happens to much when I was in an orphanage
There's a war crime
1:03 was I the only one who heard the flat line😬
I don't even know you but I already hate you
Now I just feel so grateful that I live in a nice cozy loving house I feel bad for others *when I was watching this video I cried)
100% sad :”v
I give a 20 or 30 bux because it's mean that the Jews is destroying every thing and that place is Palestine where they said that they're grands were there but no they are waiting and there God is Illuminati
Good acting
This made me sad.
I felt bad so I clicked on the link in the desc, but then more funds showed-
*oMg- Don’t make me choose q^p*
Why did I just know there’s a second part?
this is so sad! I cant believe kids are living in this.. next time you say your in hell just watch what hell is really (this video)
Also, because this girl is s cute it makes it even more sad!
This poor girl suffers alot
EP3 pleas!
This should be a movie.
If I was her, I wouldn’t know how to think💔.....
Wow she summed up how terrible it is for less than half of the people registering as refugees.
This really made me be grateful for the life I have and to stop complaining because people out there have way worse than I can ever imagine😔
This is si sad
Who hit record when she was drowning and how did it follow her so well and who filmed her when she was on the beach and how did they record the most important parts of the day sounds pretty fake to me
It is fake. It’s based on the war at Syria but from a developed countries perspective.
youtube 2016:nah
youtube 2017:no
youtube 2018: you know what? we will wait for his depression
youtube 2019:NOW ITS TIME
The people that disliked wanted to like were so sad that they couldn't see
I’ve seen this video in my English class
Yep, this is really shocking. Imagine only being able to live 6 minutes in a whole year!
The video isn’t even two minutes long
🙁
Lol my birthday is 16th of may
“he’s all i have left” 🥺
Bruh why would someone dislike this video? It’s literally about *CHILDREN REFUGEES* that need our *ASSISTANCE*
wait is this the part 2?
YouTube recommendations are great. Today is my birthday :)
A mother will always give her life for her children.
@Castle Crasher That's obvious so I thought it wouldn't be necessary to put it in the comment 
If your mother doesn't love you then I'll love you. <3
You really overestimate mothers then, not every mother WANTS their children or protects them. My mother surely does not want me
Is it a movie please tell me the name
0:06 More than this
0:12    Missing
      dad & husband
0:17 LIFE & DEATH
         Is nowhere
              safe?
0:30 Checkpoint and a stop sign
1:04 Paris sign
1:07 NO english
        PAs d'angins
1:12  Frontaliere
        Border
1:18 Bahnhof
It is very sad when you realise some children/teens live this way...
1:16 
hey i know that place its somewere in germany- somewere and i think i've seen this girl qwq
but "wir erreichen jetzt-"
This is life...
*what an epic gamer moment*
Yes its happening here and now. And do you guys know that.. these small wars... in syria.. iraq.. pakistan... africa... this is just the beginning.. the biggest real war is coming soon... and nothing can stop it. You can try save people children and stop the war.. im not trying to stop you from doing those good things.. but.. Peace never last.
0:25 A10 wathog
Everybody who disliked just got to sad and they didn’t like the video or started crying and everything was blurry
This all happened because she played the recorder
I want her to come live with me she shouldn't suffer like that
The first video of this reminder MW4
This should be a black mirror episode. I know that sounds insensitive, but I really got into this. Man I sound like a douche bag. I don’t really know what to do for them anyway. I am too much of a weakling to do anything.
Poor people lose their families, their everything, they starve and die from war or sicknesses..

Then, there are the children that cry because they can not get a phone, a boyfriend/girlfriend, nice clothes or whatever.... 😕
I watched this a week before Christmas and my cousins came over and started crying over getting a pair off socks along with many out her toys.   I told them that people are suffering like this all over the world...but they didn’t care
Anna frank vibes?
@Jordan P  a bit. Its just my opinion
Royal Anna how so though ? Just because she’s a young girl in wartime ?
@Jordan P i do know it. Im reading a book that was her diary back then but like how i imagine her is liek that kind of
You clearly don’t know the Anne Frank story
imagine how traumatized the poor thing is.. i’d give her all the money and food i got😭 i just wish i could do something, this was a skit and it wasn’t real but, things like this actually is happening, i just cant handle this. i feel the worst i could feel for these poor babies😭💗
I'm not crying, 😭😭😭😭😭
Someone should make a video game inspired by this, using the style of 'the walking dead game' or 'Life is Strange'
Part 3 please
after years- the 2nd part of this has only got recommended to me today
Girl in the video reminds me of my cousin, so this hits hard.
Same birthday as me
I want this to end in part 3
I’m just asking, why did 2.3K people dislike
2.3K Dislikes ??!!!!!
How did they get the cameras??? 🧐🧐🧐
It’s fake - moron.
..... :( .....
This is a future vision of WW3
I love how people only care when it's a blue eyed white family
@ChelseaF272 Fung True lots of Syrians/Afghanis or Venezuelans (which are promenent child refugees) have pale skin so...
I don’t think so this is just the actors they chose to portray this family
@La Mensovich There are many children in this position now but I cant think of any situation off the top of my head in modern days where there are white families in this exact situation, not saying that I would like any group of people to be in that situation, however I do think that it's funny that a marketing team decides to use these actors to portray this event that others have to deal with. Also I did not say that only white people care when it's a blue eyed white family I said people because I feel that there are a larger portion of the population that is of color that go through this challenge and yet again they manage to use white actors. There are also many times in history where there are horrible things that happen that are only dealt with when it effects the majority of the population aka caucasian people.
No but you're being racist for saying that
I don’t think people pay attention to that stuff.
Its so sad how a mum is giving a bear as a present, its all she can afford probably.
16th of may is my birthday too!
I feel bad for the mom!! ;(
This is why we should not take stuff for granted before its all gone!
*are you related?*
_no_
_I mean-_
*cuts to next scene*
NEVER EVER START AN WAR
I wish that gosh darn onion choooing ninja would leave me alonee
No
Oh no! This is wrong!
*to be honest if this is a movie it will be so amazing*
It's still happening
0:30 JAKE PAUL!
Is this real?
This isn’t real but it’s based on wars happening just now in Syria
This would have made a great far cry game intro
When she said he’s all I’ve got left I cried and my heart shattered like a mirror
Bäřty Bøy why .-. Bruh I just said it made me cry and I don’t understand that why I hate me ._.
Wow your no different then half of the comment section congrats for fitting in with 50% of people who watched this, I HATE YOU
We need a 3rd one
This is why we all have to cherish every moment we have in happiness and with our families cause we don't know what will go wrong this little girl at this young age is strong and no child should ever have to go through what she did.
Bruh
A normal day in the USA 😂
Sequil
Shes been through to much.!
Everybody wants the world to change, but nobody wants to die
What’s that suppose to mean
Is this a movie or something
Meh
*He's all she got left.*
Piece of art this commertial 

Just save them and thank you
This broke my Herat :c
The first video started with her birthday. She was happy and with her family, with a cake with multiple candles. 
It also ended with her birthday. She was with her mom, at some sort of refuge, with a simple little cake. 
This video started with her birthday. She may not have a cake, but shes with her mom who got her a gift. 
This video ended with her birthday. She's alone, no cake or celebration. 
That hurts
Wait... what’s going on??
It’s based on the war in Syria
"I'm not getting onto the boat without you"
Gosh I almost cried
She is all he got... I -.... My heart shattered...
Where all humans come in why
Poor girl. It must be really tough.
It’s not real (based on real events)
*hes all ive got left*
me: *stop cutting onions*
Dang, the camp got villaged and pillaged.
So Alan Walker made a song called Lily
La nena vlogger
Es una poronga esto
Ok idk why I wanted to say this but whoever played this girl is absolutely gorgeous and whoever says she looks bad is a foul mouthed rat.
And it was happening 4 years ago
:’[
where’s the other part and what’s the name of the girl
No harm but why does this remind me of cod mw
HOLY JESUS U SCARED ME (but this has made me get the big sad)
It’s like she had her own kids LOL
That’s not funny at all it’s just rude
1,000 subs And I will sub to my subscribers why would you joke about this?
Youtube you never recommend me good videos it’s either something really dumb or really sad
Humans are fucked
I just want everyone to be happy... :(
And people see soldiers like heroes, but they are assassin's, rapers and stupid ones who think they defend their country when the only thing they do is serve for the interest of bigger powers who don't care about others life
Not all are like that, but i agree that the vision of defending your homeland has been distorted
Me after watching this vid: Therejustactors,therejustactors,therejustactors..
Britain after Brexit
My heart broke piece by piece watching this video
John Lennon wanted to end this, and someone shot him because of it.
First day of the vlog be like
At least she doesn’t have to go to school anymore 😍
*no*
Is this real?, I mean how did they film of this
It’s just actors
omg I remember watching the other one when I was so young wthhh
What I wanna know is why the comments for the first part of this video are turned off
Incredible advert.
I remember that song.. "Everybody wants to change the world.. but no one, no one wants to die"
Maybe a dumb question but is this video real? Or she is just acting whats going on over there.
@Jordan P i guess if we cant do much the best we can is at least appreciate what we have rn and try not to be a pain in the ass for anyone
@Jordan P makes sense, its so sad, thanks.
It’s just acting but it’s based on what’s happening in Syria
1 like = 100000🙏🏻
I got sad when she had papers of his missing dad and brother.
Where is this supposed to be based in, where is the kid from? What war?
TenderDaddy69 _ Guns just lead to more violence. Look at the state of America
The Doctor they’re facing a big L, this is why civilians need guns man protect yourself.
This video is based in Britain but it’s fake it’s based on the war in the third world like Syria but it gives us an impression of what they are facing
This shot me in the heat when she said “He’s all I’ve got left”
#savethechildren
can we just have peace on this world
The first one was

Just because it isn’t happening here
doesn’t mean it isn’t happening 

Now this one is

It’s happening now
It’s happening here
In real life, nobody would care.
We all need peace in this world it would make life a more enjoyable time I’m 11 and I want to help
this video make me cry, really.
Tf the kids disliked this video
Why was someone recording this yet they could be helping
This is acting
LMFAOO
I hope- wherever this was going down...I hope this is over right? Were almost 2020- this video has got to be just old and not current right?
Wrong the war in Syria and terrorism is still happening
I've cried- I've cried so many times
Dislikers can suck my .... man it hurts whats happening in this world and we cant do anything ...
YOU SHOULDNT SEPARATE SIBLINGS!!!!!
Children suffer the most in war... Why can't everyone live in peace and harmony... God save our souls😢
damn...I'm crying...
Ähm hallo die is in deutschlabd angekommen warum redet keiner deutsch hier
God, why just why???
2020?
“He’s all I got left”

Now that is why the world is it great enough
Its normal, we are humans, we were born for that, human need war, because if we are in peace, something will happend, something worst than war
We're the only species in this entire world who harm other human beings the way we do, nice try love
Lize Hu “its normal” u mentally ok?
That’s what they’re going to do with European kids
This may be staged but still is heart breaking
MrGrinderMan it is staged have you seen some of the clips here????
@Roman Walker I meant like it's staged
MrGrinderMan ?
It is.
Just think what it would be like if you were in this position
i disliked it cuz i cant stand watching things like these. i mean i feel so sorry for those people who faced these shits and im here all along, being safe and sound but just increasing the views of these video and doing nothing in order for them to help. why some people commit themselves to be a puppet from high positioned warfreaks? why do they have to do this? they are so overwhelmed by their craziness to power, they turn the world into chaos. but again, this comment is nothing and i can do nothing to help them.
It's spreading awareness
What war is this? What people are fighting? Who are the ones with jets and helicopters and who are the guys in leather jackets and ski masks?
It’s just based on the war on the third world like Syria but instead of happening over there it’s happening here in Britain
Man I wish there was only good things in this world.
‘He’s all I have left’ 
Instant heart failure
Part 2?
Thought war was fun
#SAVECHILDREN
What has this world become...?
This is bad but Syria is worse!🥺
I cry I really really cry! 😭
It’s so sad, and me so sad 😭😭😭
We should be thankful for what we have....we have parents,food shelters to keep us alive,some people r starving out there begging,crying for food while we r in our house complaining....some people cant have what we have..even if they want to.....we should be happy to have everything,even if u dont have everything u should still be thankful for all u got,we should pray for those who r out there begging,crying for food,shelter.they have to eat from our garbage,they have nothing,not even parents.we should never complain about our lives.....just cry bc ur in a condition like this.....imagine how lucky u r.....having foods,parents,shelters.we should never complain about what we have.....
This reveals the deep-rooted racism in our thinking... as soon as it's a white child going through what brown children are going through every day, suddenly it's easier to be sympathetic
I was just watching this video and when it showed the boy I was like ‘Omg! I know him!’ 😂😂😂 Sorry, I just felt like saying that
i still don’t think people understand that these things are really happening in the world.
its so scary that things like these are happening right now ☹️💔
Can we talk about her acting? That's so good
Does anyone know where is this?
Brainwashing 1000000%
It's a feel bad for refugees to allow the invassive agendas to proceed
I've been in a similar situation love
*What is wrong letting people happy?*
No.
*i mean—*
😭😭😭😭❤️❤️
Jah
This is how you should think about refugees more closely. They travel on boats to different countries.  One  of the best videos I’ve seen.
Her life was great before the war at least she lived
One like=one more kid and animal to be saved
If this is happening rn WHY aren't we hearing about it??? HIW is this not more addressed?????
This isn’t really happening in Britain/ Europe it’s based on the war in Syria which is happening right now
This is the consequence of following any religion, open ur eys and think for urselfs stop following a fake entity that does nothing for u
@Pink Seashell u keep telling urself that.........keep holding on to that so called hope when the world around us is teetering on the brink of annihilation cause of over population and religious extremist trying to get the world to bend at the knee and governments unable to come to fair and decent compromise and also the global trade war which is quickly spiraling out of control and on top of all that we got other country's bringing there problems to our front door step oh and did i also mention fake news runs rampant and its certainly noticeable that other country's have interfered with external elections which they had no right in doing...............oh and fuk communism
Tyler Wright religion can keep people’s hopes even slightly up in dark times and why are these people’s religion what you’re worried about right now when that religion is harmless and when people are being killed for it?
He’s all I’ve got left 


Heart break
0:39 I'M NOT GETTING ON THE BOAT WHITOUT YOU YOU!!

0:41 "literaly in the boat without her"
Foda.
It’s happening now.
It’s happening here.



*wait wha-*
Shovly • but war was end in 2018 but Kurdistan it’s happening now in east Kurdistan
Shovly • it’s happening here in Syria and Iraq and Kurdistan
here as in on the earth rn :,)
Why are people like this it hurts to think that not everyone is safe
I've never seen something more heartbreking 😭😭😭
Why won't they just buy a loot crate or raid someone?
exactly! boomers these days...
2.3k dislikes!?! 
This world isn’t right
I wonder whats gonna happen in the 3rd one
Jesus..."He's all I've got left" that honestly destroyed me.
What will happen if we keeping fighting for world dominence
This is suitable for the Oscars
why there a bad thumbnails iy
Ahh the leftist agenda.... make us feel guilty for having safe, Terror-free countries. Ask the European countries who took in Syrian refugees how their crime spiked (cough, cough Germany).... except for Poland who took none, they didn’t have any increase because they didn’t allow any. Don’t use these propaganda videos to guilt us into destroying ourselves.
If we dont get another one for 2020 im gonna riot
This is why us Canadians are safe lmao
It's sad they have to make them all white to get people to take it seriously
この子は心強い子ですね。泣かず必死に耐えている姿戦争のつらさわかりやすく感動しました 
でもこうなることを私たちは望んでいません。平和に暮らしたい。ただそれだけ
This poor girl lost her mother and father and only had him and even he got taken away for all we know her mother and father could be dead I can’t imagine what my life would be like if I was in here shoes my empathy for her is strong
:.( im so sad for her
And the goverment does not want these people to live in peace in their country
For all the people saying they can't do anything about this, YOU CAN. Go to the description and DONATE
IS THIS REAL
Hey, she can play pubg for free
99.9% promised we wouldn't cry only 0.1% made through it without crying( I am in tears)
The trauma will be with her foerver 😥
i’m in tears.
The kids are suffering so terribly. WHAT DID THEY DO? They're innocent. WHY do they have to suffer so much? Why can't the whole world do anything to protect them?
The World is Quiet.
Lol xd
I literally started crying when she said “he’s all I’ve got left”
Funny
That's why you need a phone that can save from water
😭😭😭😭I FEEL BAD FOR HER I mean like she doesn’t have her dad or mother anymore and that kid, she is now separated from him. Oh how the world changed😭😭😭😭😭😭
they're like Aj and Clementine from the walking dead
ah.. idk why i keep rewatching this video.
it’s just so well made and everything about is just.. it’s hard to explain. 🥺
I wish I could kill those dislikers
This is BJ's UK. Putin will be pleased.
Oh my
Damn, 2.3k disliked this smh
Jueguen mainkra
This terrifies me :(
How did I never see this part
Please support Syria 🇸🇾
😢
2.4k republicans got triggered watching this video
So for the racist and greedy fucks that tell immigrants and refugees to go back to their countries. This video is for you. This could be you, this could be your children. But it ain’t. you live good safe lives. And innocent people deserve that too. Whether or not their beliefs, religion or skin tone.
I want more of these types of refugee and war videos. They're so heavy
The fact that people disliked the video is sickening.
Basically the story of Clem and AJ in a action movie.
True
We need peace in this world. We only have one life to live....this is sad
The saddest thing is that I actually own that same stuffed rabbit :(
No the saddest thing is that people don't understand the meaning of this video
Que le paso al hermano?
I have a younger sibling and this hurts me
There will never be total peace in the world, someone will make crimes, murder, or even worse. It’s how the world was created to move on and on
*why the heck isnt this film oscar nominated*
0:30 JAKE PAUL!
High Expectations jake paul
Why?!!
Heartbreaking 😢
It’s sad because she’s used to it. 🥺
This is messed up. Why. Just. Why.
Oh god there’s a second one
When she couldn’t turn on her phone and muttered “mommy...” my heart sank
@Cinnamon o
@SparkleGamer playz she almost drowned and her phone did
Actually, it's "mummy"
Why couldnt she turn it on?
sad kakyoin
The people who disliked are heartless, cold, unhappy people.
It’s crazy how in a few seconds something can make your cry so much....
I want a third part, it’s like a movie :c
Dam that must be 3 years
Fgufc the people that were pointing guns at them.
Well this is GTA in real life.
😢
i wish i wasnt emotionally inept so i could appreciate this so much more
Is the whole thing about a hurricane


Because I fell bad for them
No it's a out war
She has no family, she has her bunny- that’s it. It’s so sad to see children having to go through this
won’t somebody please think of the children
These videos are so good I'm not even going to comment that she didn't age at all in two years
The fact this is actually happens makes me feel so grateful for what I have now. This is horrible and needs to be stopped!
i want to help all the people in the world who are suffering but i just  don't know how?
She kinda reminds me of Clementine from the Walking dead
Which war even is this?
EAMCFC the current war in Syria
I want to help but I don’t know how
This is so sad... ): I can’t imagine living that life... god bless her heart ❤️
But..this is real??
It’s insane that this kind of stuff happens and there’s nothing that I can do about it. Birthdays go on the same times as deaths and yet the world still goes on and I worry about the dumbest things. I wish there was a way to change more people’s minds but I know there isn’t.
This is sad
Lisa Hannigan Fall piece of lyrics
"Hang the Rich and Spare the Young"
Afghanistan challenge
The fact they had to move countries, this was very sad.
Not just that but they had to escape a war
i wonder.... where is this girl now?.
i’m gonna day shut up rn
She lost all her relatives + grandparents

Then she lost her dad because the door was shut quickly

Later on she lost her mom because not a lot of people could get on the boat

Now she lost her brother because he got adopted into a new family

This is sad, refugees from everywhere are trying to escape from war zones

Yet our president isn’t doing anything about it.
ZÍMZALABÍM VÉLVÉT you mean Obama wasn't doing anything lol?
Kids always suffer the most. Poor things.
Okay seeing the angel of the north hit hard cause thats like....quite near to where i live. Made this video seem a little less detatched from my life
bro i remember watching the first one🥺
This is why the world is so messed up.
War is never the answer
Wait is this real or?
Simply Nav partially. The video itself isn’t real but it’s based on a real war going on in Syria
sick of this world man🥺
how is this not headline news ?
0:30 jake Paul?
I can feel so much pain in this hurt.
In order for peace to come we have to make it for ourselves, if we make it for ourselves then we can spread the love and it'll make a peaceful country, we can't do it if we have power and money hungry people in this world.
wait i’m confused is he her brother
If you read this I can say this is important

If you ever get in situation like that here is what to do:

1.take the most important stuff from your house
2.find a weapon
3.go to the nearest shelter
4.find supply of food/water
5.find other people and team up
6.take a route to a border (so you can get out of the country that you are in beacuse it has war)
7.start living new life in the other country

I hope that was useful
yo was I the only one who heard "Jake Paul!" when they slammed the window
this makes me so sad. 💔
Wi ind the sckool we talk bad dis
Its so sad T^T
this is so sad why can’t we all just be at peace for just a day? 😭😩
Even peace for a day won't save us from destruction
Well I’m Crying.
#SaveChildRefugees
0:14 “I’m not hungry” 1:16 “I’m not hungry” 😭😭😭
At this moment in time recommending this to people aint a good idea
Shouldn’t have kids if u can’t support them
Infamous TV yeah spastic niggas that can’t handle their stupid religion so they fight
Fabian Oreilly hmmm, that’s not what this is. This is about the Syrian war.
"He's all I've got left"
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING-
Damn it. You got me
Marta A. I am crying you got me
I cried tbh this makes me appreciate everything I have so much more bless people who are going through any bad situations 😓
No one:
Refugees: *this video*
America while Trump is pres and posts something on Twitter: *also this video*
😭😭😭😭 were all so lucky guys
Okay now I REALLY hate Donald Trump.
If I was to ever have one wish to make for the world it would be for there to be world peace and everyone would live a life as all equal no matter what it would be like having a huge family
This did so sad 😭 😞
Her birthday is exactly mine
This hurts my heart so badly 🥺💔 these poor innocent people.. 



Why.. ? 





Just why...
Them planes hitting might have something to do with as too why
Gaye Ural unfortunately
Susana Esparza Because some “special” people must always have more and more with their never ending greed, plus war makes these special people richer
Why what woman takes the little boy? 😥😥😥
THE LITTLE KID MADE ME CRY WHAT
Who the hell is this girl.
I know this isn't a joke but this is what apoc. Rising on roblox will be like more controlled
I cant stop watching these two videos. It is so sad that they had to go through this.
SHE HAD TO WITNESS SOME OF THAT ON HER BIRTHDAY JESUS GIVE THIS CHILD SOME HELP IF ANYONE ELSE DOSENT I WILL
@zøomer it's not that cold I just said U cant
@smokey reee thats cold dude..
U cant
I hope it gets better for her
Aww she has grown alot older from last time but she is really strong! Keep it up!!!
Only American people have true happiness, while we suffer...
Why does everyone blame it on America? We did nothing wrong. Ok maybe our goverment is messed up, but you can't blame everything on us.
Me hoping it gets better from the last video
The video: NOPE!!
In war, not everyone is a soldier...
900th like
@J. Jonah Jameson No soldier is human, but not every works, too.
And Sadly, Not every soldier is a human....
@Josue Martinez indeed. Many histories trough the borders, many stories beside the walls...
well those people will be the first to die.
0:29 just made me feel weird...just seeing something so close to home being destroyed makes me feel anxious
Now imagine how Syrians feel when they see their home, their neighbourhood, their city being destroyed.
Which fricken war
The Doctor ok
-ImHalis -ImHalis look it’s not about a specific war or region. The first start the girl was from Britain and then fled to different European countries. It reflects any war currently happening in the third world and the children caught up in it.
Which country or rebels?
The war happening just now
life is so short
I always asked myself , why those wars even started , and why are still going on?
@Lăbușu rău I am not saying religion is a bad thing. I think it's a good thing but some people fight because somebody believe in different religion than the other one and that's the bad thing. I don't mean that we all need to be friends but the wars aren't necessary
@Sára Komárková well in this case religion is a bad thing ,but without religion people would be real monsters knowing that  nothing is going to happen with them afterlife, that's why heaven and hell were "created"
Most of the time because of religion. I just saw some comments under this video, two people were ,,fighting" in comments because one of them said he/she don't believe in God but the other one did. It's sad cause if people just believed in what they want without hating each others religion, there would be more peace in the world
i hate knowing that stuff like this is actually happening and there’s nothing that i can do
@NipsyNuggets 
Spread the word like they spread their SEMEN?!?!?!
NipsyNuggets I’m sorry but spreading a video everywhere really isn’t going to do anything tbh. That’s the reality. Unless there’s physical assistance in regards the governments, then yes, things will change. But spreading a YouTube video to people isn’t going to change much...we watch the video, move on with our lives. Watching a video isn’t going to physically help anything. 😢
There's nothing anyone can do its just our society your either innocent or a criminal
There is so much you can do. It doesn’t even involve donations. Visit Amnesty.com.
Omg same bday as her 
Also this is so sad im scared
Wait, were the boy her littlebrother or not?
Sandra AH no
Cloverfield
But who was filming?
It is what it is like
“Im not getting on the boat without you”
Then proceeds to get on the boat without her
Kingredrex stop making up jokes. This is serious
She was forced
She was obliged don't be emotionless
I'm crying  my dads in the army left for 7 months😭😖 I cant stop thinking about him
I hope he returns home safely
Hayley loves dolls 
Aw
Is this supposed to symbolize what is happening in Syria because isn’t she British?
@Jordan P oh okay i'm from the states so i was kinda confused thanks
Yes it’s to make it real for us (British people)
How could someone dislike. This is truly heartbreaking
@LRaze Its because he makes jokes about war. He made other jokes on different comment threads in this vid too. Don't defend him he thinks that's funny.
see how easily you get mad over 2 comments? yikes.
Now mobile gaming god is mad
Hello do you know if this video is a recreation of what is happening?? And if it is is the girl an actor? If so does anyone know their name I wanna see what they do in their life
@Danbero wow
Wow thats deep
This made me cry 🥺
The baby noise the kids dying the kids are not the fault the adults are don’t kill kids don’t kill people
0:22 I truly had shivers. So disgusting
Chipotle
@and thats on periodt luv. The older man stroked the young girls face
@Rika Chan i thought that same too, its really disgusting
and thats on periodt luv. Sexual assault. Probably the man whome you can see only the hand for that split second was a bit of a pedophile and found the little girl attractive.
and thats on periodt luv. I think sexual assault
If she were brown, viewers would turn blind eyes.
Actually, it would be the opposite. People would notice _more_ if she was a poc. Either way though, color doesn't matter. That is a human child suffering and it's about time people made a difference.
Definitely
this is from a movie. I swear it
Amyachan what movie
all of you think this is crazy but this is happening in syria and stuff
Not all of us 
And it's not only in syris it's in many places and countries or states 
We just have to have hope
I feel sad
I am crying 😭😭😭😭😭
Now it is time for me to cry and get over it about 2 minutes later

And cry again
I was going to comment "ok boomer" since ppl in my school actually said it's a funny boomer thing but this video made me have tears running. It's a very serious -- upsetting video and I'm disappointed in myself that I used to joke about this.
Spain be like:
.
.
Go back to your damn country! >:C
.
.
And that makes me sad
Because thousands of refugees are not like this girl and taking advantage of their hospitality.
Except most of the “refugees” are just exploitative economic migrants who don’t experience what’s shown in this short film.  Frightening and well-made as it is, it’s straight propaganda.
@dark sugar Well Italy is full of comunism and dictature with immigrants that came with Iphones and rapes childrens and women but dont let innocent immigrants enter, so, not a surprise
@nani grogrofor nein nicht 80% ich kenne keinen in meiner Stadt den ich betreue der respektlos ist. Es gibt einige aber nicht 80%.
I really want to help them
Who disliked don’t have a heart
They sold it for a gun
the likes of u is just lime the dislikes
It’s probably because there are children on this app, they can see this video and maybe get a trauma-
They might not like it because it's sad.
So i guess i don't have a heart
Guys at 0:30 seconds it says Jake Paul😂💀
Is this an actual movie cuz I want to watch it.
No it’s just a clip
Please, before commenting something stupid... consider this. Some people immigrate to first world countries because those countries offer them benefits. They aren’t living in danger back in their own country. They just want money and that’s an easy way to get it. THAT is why we can’t just let everyone into our countries. Because many MANY people abuse the system. Trust me, an overwhelming amount of immigrants do. 

But for the ones that actually need a safe space, we can’t offer that to them. And it’s horrible... it’s the brutal truth. No, we can’t just let everyone into the country. But we’re trying our best to get the people who genuinely need our help in. It’s life.
h..ow did they film this-

it’s sad how most of the people in the world are so ignorant that just because this isn’t happening in their place it means that it’s not happening in the world. This is sad
Wdym how did they filmed this? Its a film. And also I don't think people who doesn't know what's happening outside of their country is being ignorant. Lets say Syria is in war right now, and your country is all peacefull and you think that the rest of the countries in the world are the same. That wont make you ignorant, you just don't know what's going on outside of your country.
This reminds me of Anne Frank...
How tho
If all the people could see that video the world would be much better 😢.
All because dad didn’t want to go
I still dont know why people dislike on these..
We watched part 1 in school 😂👍
Now that’s World war 3
gemini
Why is she so pretty?
we have the same birthdays :<
See guys this video is the reason why you need to think about the illegal immigrants. Many of them only try to sneak to other countries because they want what's best for themselves and their children. Many selfish conservatives have admitted to me that they don't care about these foreigners, which is just awful!
This real???
This isn’t no because it’s not happened here but it is really happening across the world
This video breaks my heart. ;^; Plus I have the same bunny plush the girl has!
AHHH. I LITERALLY SWIPED OFF THE VIDEO




im supposed to sleep- i must sleep- to videos I can sleep to


USUALLY I CAN
am i the only one that comes back to this video every few years or so?
Nope.
yeahh!
idk not at aLl
Is this world war II or soemthing
No this is what’s happening in the world today
Clementine
This could be made into a video game
I wish I could help her.
Walking dead in a nutshell
I feel really bad that I watched this and didn’t do anything. I don’t know WHAT to do. Would I even do anything if I knew what to do? 
I think I’m a terrible human being.
Teresa it's not your fault 
The problem is we don't have the power to do something against it specially if we are young but we can fight for their freedom!
Not everyone is a horrible human being
Stop showing me videos that make me feel I am not able to do something for this people
Well you're not nobody is in fact our planet is going to die
Aw this is so sad
I want to help this people so much, but i dont know how...
Donate to the charity
Idk how I could help
Donate to the charity
This video used to make me cry but now it makes me scared I’m not sure why but I feel bad for all those people
@ii_liv that's ok 🖤🖤💫
Rōnin sorry I just feel bad for the little girl in the video
Inci Moawad Yes
@iiAestheticPanada okay
Sure will be when a flood of war or refugees finally hits your brain.


No longer responding, :)
I feel sad about syirian children's and Palestine actually. This is not about religion but Humanity
@Shareddy nope. protests were happening in Colombia. things were on fire, innocent ppl dying. look it up
emily judaism is a religion not race
Omg my birthday is may 11 2003
OMG I feel so bad for her she had a very bad life :( , oh lord to God I hope she live a  better life in the future:(
@Rōnin ehh true
@excuse me bitch that's mine thank you but you did
She's an actor this is representing our society nowadays
@Rōnin you said you like to irritate for their reactions so it gave me a good reminder not to do that
@excuse me bitch that's mine thank you what?
Is this real?
No from Britain’s perspective but this is happened in the third world just now yes so effectively it is real
Is that Kelli maple
Jesus
Is this real or a skit?
Is not real because this isn’t happening in Britain but it’s to reflect what’s happening in other countries who are at war
I'm pretty sure that this is a skit, but the same thing happens to other children
Why did she say 16th of may 2003? I’m sorry for being ignorant but did something happened in that date?
Elisa oh! I thought she asked the date for today. Dumb be, thank you
The woman asked for her birthday and she replied
This video and its predecessor are remarkable pieces of filmmaking.
For the first one, I realized it was gonna go wrong because of the news channel and newspaper in the background
[REDACTED] haven’t you seen the beginning of the story? That videos came out two years ago.
Cool
[REDACTED] me too
You see? this is why we can't have good things.

Edit: Holy sh*t did not expect this to get so many like thank y'all so much!!!
Wot
Even here
People lways want likes on their comments
@Sir Tyranus wdym
@FBI What are you doing here?
@NintendoBoy 2009 You are such an idiot, who cares about how many likes you got? Is it the way you choose to help the cause?
things i never noticed years ago until today:
0:15 "that's the hospital"
0:17 the news article in the back
0:19 that's the present she got from her mom, and now she's passing it down to the little boy
0:32 the man dying in the back
0:44 the girl protecting the boy
1:00 "his parents drowned?"
1:07 "no english"
1:12 "border"
1:16 "i'm not hungry" just like her mom
1:19 "refugees welcome"
@Valeria López a ok

Name girl and vídeo please ?
Everybody, appreciate your safety.
1:14 did someone say you bitch
0:22 big no no 😡
Why didnt they took them in helicopter or evacuation

00:30 JAKE PAUL!
0:30 " *JAKE PAUL* "

All of you thrugh you the virus came under dewolop country said daid .you are not humen.
I cry so Hard
Why did they use the angel of the north from Newcastle britan
Ноябрь 2019. Русские? Трогательная и ужасная история выживания.
Quick reminder for all kids who are living a perfect live . Don't Make fun of someone that has a hard life . It doesn't mean that if it didn't happened to you yet , you will ignore and make fun of them . They are not entertainment for you . Its a lesson that we should be proud of our lives wthere if its good or bad , because most of us has a bad life.
So this video is advocating for illegal immigration? Great.
Actually it’s letting you know the reason “illegal immigration” can happen. I’m pretty sure if it was you that you’d flee to wherever is safe.
Insensitive prick
*i didn't know there was a second part*
Still alive, still eating, and still with people who care for her and she's frowning and acting horid. Bend her and spank her. Hopefully she learns a lesson.
why is my screen all blurry... I’m not crying.. my eyes are just sweating
my friend know this pain. He is lost his dad and brother
Wolverines daughter
it’s official. i’m ugly crying. jfc.
Why is a war even a thing?
Is this brexit
I just wanna see this girl stay happy forever.
This is so ironic. This was made by british people yet the brexit exist to close the border for refugee. Even tho the wars in middle east are started because cold war which UK has great influence in it.
But we can’t just open our boarders to everyone as eventually we will put the British people at risk
My birthday is the 16 of May too.
This is soo sad
I wonder what war it’s based on
Resources. Power. Greed.
No entendí el vídeo :v
(╥﹏╥)
For all the stupid fucks who only understand and care about tragedy when the children are white and speak English.
Just like the mom she pushed the guy off the boy to protect her
The boy was all she had left ;(
i watched this a long time ago and decided to rewatch it a few times, it still hits me right in the feels.
Dear god. Even if this is all just a act, the a whole lot of hell left in our planet that WE can “earth”
This is what happens when No-Deal Brexit passes.
It wasn’t sad but I like how she takes good care about the brother
At the end of video sry but do not say that i know this is hard. It is a war (impossible unless with nuclear nations) and you should be giving people like this therapy and keeping families close together not breaking them up if there is a sibling only you stay together.
Unless the war is with the 9 other nuclear powers the UK is theoretically untouchable from any other force in the word as we have developed nuclear weapons since the war and the social structure of our country is one of the most stable in the developed world. If it were to happen however I would be getting ready
I'm you would want to put a THUMBS up but put a THUMBS down for people that haven't helped
☺
I was crying
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Depending how old she is in a third video. They should have her reunite with her parents and/or have a makeshift shelter taking care of young children.
1:02 someone's flatlining in the background
@Bäřty Bøy I was just pointing something out, no need to be salty jeez.
That doesn't matter kids are dying!!!!
Reminds of Children of Men. Really feels like there could be a film made about this.
Why doesn't the camera team help her?
This is a fake video (based on true events)
The child welfare departments in Japan have taken kids in charge of abuse without permission of the court. The kids are forced to live the quarantined rooms and not able to contact with anyone like their parents, friends and etc. The department cannot say it's misjudge, so many not-abused kids are in the shelter long time. We call the department "Jido Sodanjo", which has too much huge power more than police. We'd like you to know the kids human right is not protected in Japan.  Many kids are now spending the shelter sadly. Not a small numbers of kids are abused, died in the shelter. Nobody cannot enter the    shelter, so the kids cannot say the complaint of there. The worst case, the kids have to spend the shelter by the age of 18 year-old.
Dam They were sent of from England to France but then somebody called them a *Putain* a bad word in french and then they moved to Germany and then to another country
Esta gentuza de ONG Save the children monetiza el dolor de los más desfavorecidos.  Todos sus vídeos en YouTube es son poder hacer comentarios. Ahora anuncian por TV , que niño que estaba en su vídeo está muerto de hambre. Justicia española, por favor, echar ojo a esos criminales. Tienen mucho dinero, pero resulta que niño de su vídeo está muerto de hambre. Criminales!
LILY ROSE ASLANDOGDU
Very tearjerking.
😭😭😭😭 its so sad i can't take it anymore....
Well at least there’s no war everything will be just fine
Please don't Tell me This is Real
I would like to ask for permission to use parts of this great video for a cover song i'm making. Of course i will credit your amazing work! Thank you.
This actually could be FAR WORSE, the poor kid could've been hit with a Russian FIRE BOMB, the nurses having to peel off her dead skin so new skin can grow.
American Liberal response to the Carnage in Syria (reminiscent of the German Terror Bombing of London) "NONE our Business - can we spare the $$$ to do anything?  Missiles are expensive you know" (your idol Bernie Sanders)
I cried when she said have you made a wish 😭 we wish for a new x box or a bike but never for finding our parents that got lost in war 😭 or something soo basic like food or water 😭
If they ever did a third part, I imagine the country she fled to will also enter war, and then it goes nuclear.
We cant save them all
More than 3 years in - nothing changed. :'(
--- so sad, we all should feel it. 
I am Pakistani, and wish that this should never happen to western children and families as they have lived life so pampered,  they will not be able to bare this hardship.  Hope it never happens to them and to anyone.
That's a nice gesture, except that ironically pakistanis are among those who are are raping, drugging and trafficking thousands of western children in the UK, and have been doing so for several years. The authorities do absolutely nothing to stop it (in fact sometimes they'll actually arrest the VICTIMS or the victim's relatives) as they are under orders from somebody very high up in the chain that would like to see the west destroyed.
This girl is in the middle of Doomsday.
STOP The Great Replacement
0:30 JAKE PAUL!!!
are they making another one?
OMG!
Poor girl
What is the story I still don’t get it
It’s giving the idea of what the war in places like Syria is like from the view of a developed country such as Britain
she had and L on her forehead for lily or something


this is sad.
This was incredibly impactful. I saw the Syrian refugee crisis first hand in Turkey. Traveling with two small children, I was afraid to do anything. Thank god for organizations like this. There is absolutely zero crime in wanting to escape danger and/or starvation.
It's so sad that she was separated from her brother 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It wasn’t her brother
This should be a movie
This girl should win an Oscar her performance is amazing
Yea
Even for me 1:09 made me tear up no joke "I want my mommy and daddy"
Guys we all thank you for your help already children will never forget your help even if you can't help but you can pray for us god will help us too thank you again ❤
My heart wrenching when I c this innocent kids going through so much suffering in life.
I feel sorry for her : (
Leaving out Assad using Chlorine Gas Bombs.  The stuff is heavy and fines its way into places people (children) would hide from Russian bombs - basements, bomb shelters.  
Leaving out the Russians fire bombing those who simply pack up and leave as Assad told them to. . Leaving out the Greeks banning refugees from using the trains that is why they all had to walk so far.
If you're ever wondering about what war does to children, then this is a very good example.
This is exactly what war does to children.
It's heartbreaking.
I remember this got shown in school assembly a few weeks ago. Most hallowing assembly ive ever seen
this is a cruel world，but，they are not my problems，help them will become troubles，wake up，kindness is no necessary.
Great message 
Just cause it’s not happening now doesn’t mean it’s not happening 
👍
yet here yall typing in hope of likes with those emojis
If this was a real event what would probably happen is some twat tries to build a tank out of energy drinks then everyone goes for fish and chips.
JESUS CHRIST
So sad to people dislike this video
the video is amazing but the actual events of this going on right now? nowhere near amazing.
in general we need to help refugees as much as we can but we also need to help the children refugees sometimes even more so. donate!!
War Is Hell but Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum
ohhhhh noooooo
Oh, this brings back so many memories! 😢💔
And a trumptards will yell "send her back!"
I feel upset right now I hope some one can find them a better life
Im not sure if this is real or not?
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
you love to compare demographic war but forget your own history,,we all are barbarian
The video is supposed to make people think about how unfair it is that children are living with frightening situations and that we should help this to end.   Another way to see it is that there will possibly be this scenario happening in our own countries and this is the future we will have brought upon ourselves by allowing a very different ideology to live and thrive within our societies.    There's more than one message to take from this and both are valid.
We dont forget that is real life of too many child. We are only lucky people
Nossa mano que pesado vey
It’s funny that this is a pro refugee ad but as the days go on London and Paris starts to look more and more like this
Bruh is this real
;(
DUDE THIS IS SO SAD I WANT TO HELP FUE PEOPLE LIKE THEM
We need a game or a movie like this (but in Europe in a ww3 context)
This is sad and heartwarming at the same time. Lily didn’t deserve to be in that horrible situation. I know this is an advert but I hope she found a family.
Is that her real life brother? They look so alike.
What why are there planes attacking England i am so confused.
they went to Germany?
世界中が知るべき映像
Everything the British did hundreds of years ago will fall back on their people like this
Alien invasion + WW3 + Kaiju destruction of Cities + A.I. Killings of Humanity + current War on Terror of the US = Revelation
Can we get an F for Lily (the girl)?
She's like Clementine in The Walking Dead
I was like her i seen the dead withmy eyes and now Denmark says we must go home😢
Anyone know her name please?
SYRIA🙌
This is a movie? 
What name movie?
It's sad how they found a family for her little brother but not for her. They should be put together.
I just started tearing up
Is she ok
Potatoes are my friends...
We all will save you guys
You can tell when she looks at the camera she wishes the war would stop
Great movie
We wish the giri be safe
Who's the camera man?
I’m guessing this video is representing the refugees trying to get to Europe as millions are trying to get away from the war even when they get to Europe they are sometimes persecuted and not welcomed some even wash up on shores some stranded on sea as most don’t know how to swim
Liberal propaganda. Like there is a war and those people are just victims of it. But in fact they are part of the problem.
Make a movie please
This is like Clementine and Aj

Only twd fans will understand
No, you're just a pervert
why'd they turned off the comment section on the first video ???
wow i want in where do we sign up?
I'm crying
I feel as though this will become an accurate representation of Europe of the laws regarding asylum seekers aren't reformed. Refugees will always bring  pre-existing conflicts and problems with them.
للأسف وبالرغم من التطور الذي 
شهدته البشرية  في كل المجالات ,إلا
أن الأطفال لا يزالون الأكثر عرضة للظلم والانتهاك في كل بقاع العالم وخصوصا التي
تشهد موجه عدم الاستقرار بسبب الحروب والكوارث الطبيعية.
On Wednesdays I help with Congolese and Kareni refugees and... I can't even begin to imagine what they're been through. You wouldn't believe the smiles they have, the most beautiful things I've seen, and you wouldn't believe how funny and ambitious... and sometimes they zone off, they stop talking until whatever memory stops playing in their head and there's nothing I can do but let them rest their heads on my shoulder, it's one of the most heartbreaking things and one of the most inspiring things I've encountered in my 19 years on this Earth. I try not to get political on side or the other, but these kids and their dreams are something to stand for.
War is horrible, conflict is hell
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Most gamer battle royale
Verry eye opening!
what happened
Then there's Donald Trump saying there's too much refugees coming here, like it's only the 1.5% out of 10% refugees. Closing the borders and refusing the refugees after they traveled a far distance, that just breaks my heart. Luckily the Election is coming soon. The only thing I have against Donald Trump is this and the fact that he doesn't visit any army soldiers.
Shyrian child
Noo😭😭😭😭
It’s sad to think that so many people die due to war if I had the power I would try my absolute best to stop wars or as many wars as I could
The bit where she looked down when she said 

It’s happy birthday hit me 


Our world is troubled imagine having ur whole life torn away from u because of a war it’s horrendous and it’s actually happening we have to unite as one and stop this horror that’s normal to some children

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
0:36 And I will kill you
What a Clementine
I feel bad for this girl..is this war thing over or is it still going on
How does the camera still on her wth
1 like= no wars and earth has peaceful forever
I hope there’s a part 3 with a good ending...
The UK GOVERNMENT LOOKS AFTER OTHERS......BEFORE ITS OWN
oof
This will most likely happen to us one day because we take refugees in
On the other video got me bcuz of the dad
What do you mean every single video of this bcuz it said'children must watch'so I did and it turn that I was thinking of the future death..
Accurate representation of world war 3
This would be such a great movie
Something similar to happened in one of my favorite animes, Ninjago (If it even counts as one)






There's this little girl, and she lives in the city of Ninjago. A giant snake is attacking the city and she and her parents rush to the apartments' crowded elevator. Yet, there's only room for one person. The parents place the girl in the elevator, and die doing so. Later, the girl gets adopted by some kind citizens, and ask her: "Where are your parents? Do they have names? You sure are a quiet one."



The following season, the main villain Garmadon launches an assault on a building and a similar thing happens. Crowded elevator with small family unable to get on. The girl from before, now grown up, visits the targeted building and escorts the family to safety. The family escapes, but the girl gets crushed by the building, dying.
Supper sad story I wish she's my sister
It's actually my first time seeing this second part damn
This is war
0:22
Oh my god! That dude was just laying his hand on her face and being a creep to this poor innocent girl! God! What is wrong with these people!
And the scary thing is this girl has probably been...... lets just hope not.
This is sooo sad and when the nurse said happy birthday I broke down and her asking about parents made me break down even more
Is this thing real with the girl and boy dad mom
Hate you haters
After the video...




O.O y is my house flooded?
Edit: nvm my room is
please tell me this video is editing and actors
why hate when there's love? why fight when there are hugs? why shoot when there are kisses? Choose peace guys. That's the only way we'll all be forgiven🙏
Girl:GO BITCH!!!!
Me:Dam
This is so sad.. she lost her family! I wish the person who took him took her too, she needs a happy life, although getting adopted might not change the world back right-side-up because  she loves her parents so much, first her dad, then she lost her mom :(
Its so cute how she finds that little boy and takes care of him like a little brother shes so sweet❤❤😭😭
Adda
Omg that was the angel of the north
What is the name of the actress who plays the girl in these videos??

😭😭😭😭😭😭
1:17 lol it’s german
Love this vid, so so powerful and really gets the message across
What part of God's plan is this?
I know things like these are horrible but that is no excuse to importing masses of undocumented refugees from other cultures.
Man is that sad😢😭
you're killing the one who's going to be the root of your own country.
#SyriaWillRise
F*cking terrorism 😭
I love my mother

This reminds me of Lee and Clementine and lee with the boy and girl
The only monsters in this world is us humans
Not to be rude but who the hell attacked England?
Still scary
That’s so sad 😭 😭😭😭🥺😭😭
00:30 Jake Paulers!!!!!!!
Most of the Syrian children sure do look a lot like adult non-Syrian men, meh who am I to judge 🤗
Thats girl is so beatifull
Still can’t believe U.N. Isn’t doing anything
This is so emotional....😭
I don't understand the video
*i love how she takes care of her little brother, what a sweetheart ❤️*
loveyourself xx but she said “i mean”
That's the thing: He wasn't _actually_ her little brother. They weren't related by blood. But they *became* that close through their shared struggle finding refuge from the war and that's so beautiful. She literally saved his life in that boat by putting the jacket on him.
his parents die drowned  ,,  so she take care of him.
Not even related, she is so strong.
@loveyourself xx What makes her even sweeter is that when the lady asked if she's related to him she said "no... but-"
Just imagine this happens every second
where is third part
0:30 Jake Paul
Wow this hot me a listen we’re so lucky that we’re not stuck in the war

Wow, this is the same girl from the other video.
0:03 THE PURGE?!?!?!
Nose Rick parece falso :v
She helped the little kid because they kind of went through the same thing and she didn't want him to go through what she had too
The angel of the north never blew up
Layla Mohammed it’s just a thought of what could happen
This never happened in England nowadays
SO DEEP....
nooo the little boyyy
They said racist stuff toward the British
Short message:
Have world Peace.
I REALLY WISH I COULD HELP THEM 😭😭😭😭 im crying! 💔
*Vietnam flashbacks*
OH MY GOD. THIS IS TO SAD! 😭
This is always a good way to get people's attention about a crisis like this: imagine if that was YOUR child, in YOUR country.
Can't wait tell it happens to me. The adrenaline is already coming to me
The first one made me cry this one…
Oh man hitler's back
Is this real
0:31 i hear jake paul.
Better than world war z
Were you related?
No... I mean-
🙇🙇💜💜
This is fake, I think, right ?
Now this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down.
If you make jokes about this type of stuff then your the one that should have there life turned upside down 




HANGING FROM A ROPE
@Antonio o shhhh
that’s not funny.
I really wanna see you hanging rn , perhaps upside down
Don’t joke about this kinda stuff please
Все будет хорошо
Не ссоритесь с Россией
The sad thing is, this will never stop. It has happened for all of history and prehistory, why should it stop now?
1:04 tgv français
Her The WHO must get out of her nest all cozy and helped her people
It was sad how she adopted a little brother
All of a sudden they found his family
I’m happy for the little boy
But I still felt bad for the girl
Heartbreaking 💔
Emerset Farquharson Me too
@Nick Calderon I was so angry that they adopted the boy and not both.
Kashy_kk They didn’t find his family, they just found a family that is willing to adopt him.
Omg its sooooo sad!!!!!





I wish i could save them but i cant do it
Only jesus
This is when this sentence is appropriate to post.
*Don't be jealous of someone else's life, because you're living someone else's dream life*
Everytime I read this sentence, I feel numb.
Yea, Yet this girl has peoppe who love her, a phone, food, and a home, and she's acting like the world's most hated child. She needs to be spanked or somthing so she realizes this and learns a lesson. Because it feels like she's just acting worse than she needs to be.
This kind of reminds me of a movie and book called “Empire of the sun”. It is so sad
Por suerte, mi amigo, esto es tu culpa, si si, tu culpa, tiraste basura, quemaste, todo es tu culpa, y de todos, putos :)
Okay so this is my opinion.
Plz just stop commenting sorrow or sorry, I mean yea I may do it too, but it’s annoying when you actually realize that this world is falling a part and WE humans don’t do nothing even me, we just sit there watching videos feeling sorry but we just ignore it.
(Just my opinion)
She's just like Clementine from The Walking Dead
Except she's surviving from actual human beings. Even worse
Is this video set in world war 3
This is serious matter but at the end with her and the bit she reminds me of clem and AJ from the walking dead
She's in this situation because she hasn't subscribed to Pewdiepie
Can we just go and end what ever happening in the Middle East just let USA go there and take over and annex it
0:42 remenbered me the Bird Box
This is so sad
I'm about to experience this. Because I'm polish and I heard that Russia is attacking Poland in 2021 which I will be 13 in that year. Guess I will die young. (╯_╰)
Is this ww3
0:30
Jake Paul!!!!
How WW3 could be like. Terrifying.
Shaggy will help us
Is this real or fake
@John DC 

): I see yeah that happens and my dads home is destroyed because of bombs
This kind of stuff is happening to children right now. The vid itself is just showing what would happen if  England had gotten the same event.
The last of us new trailer should be like this
It went from bad to terrifying...
I want to see a series like this on netflix
Why can All countries live in peace 

No one not even 
North Koreans deserve this
Literally my worst nightmare

You evil bitches
You made a sequel!?!
😭😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Is she legal yet?
Whenever I see this video on my recommend I try not to look at it because it literally scares me 😂
Why is this so similar to (TWD game) Lee and Clementine’s relationship-
And then at the end it’s Clementine and AJ.
Eh, just a thought-
Yes! I was thinking about it too!
Tori Artistic Marine LITERALLY I THOUGHT THE SAME THING
War. War never changes.
The atmosphere reminds me of The Last of Us
Syrian people can save Syrian children not the U.S.'s problem.
You are telling us to respect immigrants. But respect immigrants us ?
Damn she reminds me of clementine from Twd
I'm so sad!!
poor ppl :( i want to help!!
Welcome to Britain 2030
This girl remind me of clementine
Clementine and AJ
This people are evil
Making war trying to make peace and putting others people's live a nightmare 
This is Making me cry
I can’t imagine the horrifying things she went through
Big oof
Would’ve made a neat movie.
I hope her wish is " I wish the world lives in peace"
Im not crying, my eyes are just peeing
*-OOF-*
All in the name for *OIL*
It has nothing to do with oil
Typical school day.

Oh my god
This is so sad, I hope that the childrens who live this will be ok, their family too
This kinda reminds me of twds4 by telltale, lol
Why :(
"It's happening now"
Well the UK isn't at war with Syria so no
🤡🤡🤡
Dumbest comment I've ever read. You absolute moron.
the definition of ignorance
War is happening all over the country. *you just don’t know it.*
bro its a civil war in Syria do some research before you comment
not gonna lie, i'd honestly like a series on this
before: OMG blonde hair




after: Black hair like some Asian.
0:29 JAKE PAUL
*Don't worry, Shaggy will save you, Shaggy will save us all*
Hmmmmm I’ve seen a movie that relates to this (in my opinion)
Don't they remind you of Clementine and AJ?
Lol
0:30 Jake Paul

I know it's not time for jokes.. But it's still funny
I need to help but how I’m to young to be able to go on a plane without an adult
What happend to her???? This is soo sadddddd, wheres her mom???? First, she lost her dad. And now her mom!😢
Something is telling me this will happen soon....
Ok wtf
I remember the first part of this...this is so heartbreaking as well.
And still she need to record that
I'm really confused
You as a child: mom. Is world going To be beter and safer In future?
Mom: yes sweetie. No wars or enything bad.
And when you grow up then you hear all news and thats when you realize that world.... There is no such place like safe place or sweet home. You feel like everything is like a lie. You cant trust nobody. World is gering wors day... By day.
Don’t make fun of people biting there nails.... they do it becuse they nervous.. and anxieti...
Why can’t everyone just make peace and don’t got to war we are all humans
Because we want to treat everyone the same even when they’re not.

Also, peace is overrated and boring.
Because they're fighting for their country trying to save us trying to save YOU
TIffany H but you have to have hope 
It's stronger than fear
Zack Irahza some people cant don't you understand that?
It's because humans are still stuck at the second evolution of man
She only had him :'(......
@Dinara Dis omg yes
C e c i P l a y z ._. AND THEY TOOK HIM AWAY 😭
@Dinara Dis Oh yeah
Dinka dana 
Actually more like when clementine has to kill lee

Dakota Finning
Her name is Lily Rose Aslandogdu
I would also like to knov
Liberal propaganda
Save the children and most of all STOP THE WAR.
How
You cant stop war, peace will never go on as long as humanity doesn't seek it...
@E I wish that's how it worked
What about the earth? Due to all the destruction us humans caused the earth is going to die quicker and than we won't have anywhere to live we would die
LOL war will happening no matter what you're doing to stop the war war will come  anyway  don't worry :)
i swear i heared jake paul in that video
There is no peace in this world because we are creatures that can think. We think a lot for our profits. And we can hurt others without thinking about it if it’s good for ourselves. Stop being selfish. Stop being blind. Stop looking back and hating other countries just because wars that happened centuries ago. We started this and only we can end this. Hope this video works on people and maybe we can think differently.
Life is hard but it will get better soon or later
This is so sweet.. I really want to help. How??
I got Clem and AJ vibes.
0:36 and I will kill you
Why are you making jokes... this isn’t funny.
Well that's how mafia
Oh, ok. I only don't understand
Juraj H. In the comments bruh
What jokes?
Que horror
*syria collapses due to a crisis*
nmms parece apocalipsis @_@
0:21 just sent a strong message to me. This happens every day in countries that are unprotected or have caused harm to the citizens by the government. All of the scenes in this are very shocking and touched my heart, but this one I felt deeply.
And the horrifying thing is that this girl has probably been...... lets just hope not...
What does it mean what’s he doing to her

Have some GOD dam faith
1:18 Germany
The thing is that they don't show that most me people from Afghanistan are not educated and doesn't work here in Austria or Germany. Most of Afghan or Syrian people don't work, don't educate them selves. They go here to school but most of them hate it and they don't do Homework and stuff. So I have nothing against people who want to work and educate themselves but I am against people who just want an better life and dont do anything for that.
Merry bomb mass
0:30 JAKE PAULERS
The man was actually yelling checkpoint to warn the other's
Oh hahahahaha it's so funny because you're not the one with no family, no friends, scared for their life, and dirty you don't realize how good you've got it do you? that's why you comment about something that's said in the video, because you can actually laugh at things because you're not freezing up over the things you saw you're not even scared for others health just yourself oh hahaha so funny.

This video is about life in Syria during a civil war, but instead, they used the U.K instead of Syria.

#SAVECHILDREFUGEES
I know a way we can help people like this! I want to too. But I don't have much money or allowance. Go to Kiva, (I think its called Kiva)
OMG😢💔!
Where is this???????
I live in germany, and many people are against refugees, I just don't understand it..I mean yes, there are some refugees, who are agressive and who are bad people, but in every culture there are some bad people..
just because of someone is bad, doesn't mean that everyone is like him.
My boyfriend is from Afghanistan, he's a kind person, he learned german fastly, get a job, and is going to school.
I mean, it's perfect, he tries everything, to get a good life and there are some german people, who aren't even working or don't want to go to school..
We all have to be more kind, nobody needs a war, we are ALL people, and we all live in the same world! Instead of destroy the world, we have to be more friendly to each other! We have to do all together, we don't have to fight, it doesn't even make sence!
Ystävä 703  please don't be aggressive
But your right we must have hope 🙏
Polina Kartozhynska It’s not that simple. Some people aren’t actually in danger but just want to move to a first world country because they know that country will give them money and housing. Some people take advantage of the system and ruin it for everyone else. Don’t be gullible and do your research.
@GEMOTO You don't have to meet every person of a group to get a reasonable impression of the group, what it's shared identity and goals might be.  Common sense tells us that there are risks involved in taking in great numbers of immigrants.   We may choose to give all trust tyo the immigrant group that eventually they may assimilate into the host society or we may choose to be cautious and reserve the right to deport those who seem unwilling to respect the host society and its people.  Another option is to oppose immigration completely from cultures that have a prevalence of unacceptable cultural behaviors.  This seems to be a choice that has more weight to it when the cultural habits are believed to based on religious principles and when the group as a whole is not addressing the problem.
Is she not dead from the:
● 1 missile
● 4 near miss AR bullets 
● drowning 
● nuclear gasses 
● every disease she would have 

Must i go on?
Shoot everyone has near death experiences without knowing it
sorry but if how she survived all that is really what concerns you more than the story this video is trying to tell, then you really need to get your priorities in check.
GhostlyTobes 2: Tokyo zoom  is this something you’d prefer? To the kids who are going through this to just die
GhostlyTobes 2: Tokyo zoom she is in creative mode
And she still acts all moody and horrible. She needs to tske a trip over someones knee or somthing.

*Save The Children*
When i 1st watched this at the end gaved me shivers
This is heartbreaking... Be generous for what you have, as others may not have it.
Okay , there is another one just like this. HOW MUCH HAS THIS GIRL GONE THROUGH
Oh god..!
When War Of The Worlds come true without aliens.
Is this Far cry 5? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is so sad. This video and the second one are what are inspiring  me to write a novel on the Syria crisis from a girl like her’s perpective
is this based on the book refugee? the event in this thing is exactly what happened to Mahmoud in the book
im crying
Omg I cried 😭😭😭😭
God created us to be happy, and dis is what happrns in the world
 I wish earth didnt exist so we dont have the pain. And we dont exist
The liberal athiests think that this is alright cus they evil
Can someone explain what's happening in the video.
The Netherlands!
And I thought my life was hard....
we had a debate and essay about refugees being kicked out of Europe and not being helped and stuff like that. It was mainly off the family of Alan Kurdi? We read articles about how people die in the trip and stuff they have to go through to get to a better place, but this video, even if it's just for show and awareness, it amplifies everything and it's so sad
Is this real or are they actors?
Ik something that will cheer yall up
https://youtu.be/Zx0PLW0JacQ
I almost cried😢😟😢😢😢
People desire peace but in the other hand crave conflict as well it looks like just human nature
damn, world war 3 has begun
For people who experience this takes a long journey to freedom
This is America
*why is the world so broken..........*

😢😢😢😢😢
0:30 *CHECKPOINT*
Laura?
*oof*
This made me angry. All these young men come here instead of women and children. Refugeees are welcome, of course! But not the men who are so egoistical and leave their children and women behind. It's disgusting... save the children
St. Ambrose once said "No one can heal themself by hurting another."
I really hope the message gets through.
Merry Christmas to you all.
Its happening now, and it will be the children of Europe if we don't stop immigration now.
That made me think about life
We live in world there no peace there always danger out there
Peace is weak
propaganda
😭
...
😓I'm only 10 years old and I have a little brother im thinking if... it really happens... plz #savethechildren and I love my family siblings, and friends but I wish it would not really happens to Many kids
This is a really dedicated vlogger
1:06 Is this guy Arab or something? Are they majorly involved in this war too?
this is why i hate trump. He hates refugees!
yoo
Wow just wow. . . . The most dedicated camera man on Earth.
It won't let me likeeeee
Ella otravez
I got a horror movie ad while searching this,now ill have nightmares

These people deserve peace and freedom scrap that EVERYONE deserves peace and freedom in this world
0:36 that's the last time she'll be with her mother😢🤧 I hope the video continues on
Palestine
I have reason to believe that some of these little clips were actually in the same day
You do know this video is a prediction of what is to come in Western Europe. White people will soon be the targeted and oppressed in their own homelands. A race/culture war is coming. The writings on the wall
0:30
"Jake Paul" 😂
Wait wait where did these tears come from
Omg her mom died 😭
BOI YOU TAKE AAWAY MY CHILD I BEAT YO ASS
Just why??? Why can’t we have peace in this world?
Let me see

 •Dylan K. and Eric H.
 •Bullies
 •Weapons
 •Reckless drivers
 •Nikolas Cruz
 •Criminals
 •Depression
 •Heartbreak
 •Literally everything because everything could have either good or bad outcomes
Peace doesnt exist. Im being Real.
@Bootiful Potato Guy too bad for you, I already have my life settled so no, that argument goes out the window.
Have a nice day.
@Bootiful Potato Guy yeah, yeah, I love you too
Bruh you should have just communicated via email.
Where is there ?What country?
I knew this would happen, why did I still watch it?
0:48 Wait... whos holding on to the phone
😭😭
this just sends chills down my spine
Wellcome to middle east bois. Here i will teach you how to force a 5 year old  boy how to take AKM and shoot at the enemy. I also teach 10 year olds how to work with RPG, they are really pro. If you want to learn just sign up at WWW.COM
“I’m not getting on the boat without you”
*then proceeds to get on the boat*
Omg I cried
is world war movie
They just realitated that all they need is Jesus. Jesus will forget you for everything just kame back! Please!
116 days were needed to record this
How the hell are they videoing this
was she the only one to survive on the boat
I think no because behind her were another people but this video is fiction
Why does this remind me of unedited footage of a bear?
This is not ok😢😢😢😢😢😢
GAD DAMMET AGEN
This should become a movie
Send this to your friend and tell them to spread the word "people are suffering.  People are in need. We need love not hate. Don't stay silent , you have a voice and it's time to use it"
Randall 45 don’t forget the uk
@Patricia Salvatore Stop supporting USA, China and Russia because they're the one who are bombing and oppressing minorities.
Sure, let the message get out that your own group is ready and willing to become victims. There must be another way to do help people than to take them into your own homes.
This is bad
No, it's very bad
Im crying omg
0:19 oh my fricken gosh i swear i was about to fly over to where the wars are and destroy those people
Fake.
0:30 JAKE PAUL!
Yes
I hope that was fake 😥😫😭
0:30 *JAKE PAUL*
I'm pretty sure it's jackpot
I've played this over and over, trying to find a reason, any reason, for anyone to cause someone else's life to be like this but;



There is none. This world is so far gone. We really need God to flood the world and start over. 
Best prayers to anyone experiencing anything like this.
How is her phone still alive?!?! 😮
Somone screamed Jake Paul when they were on the bus
Omg i wish this little girl did not have to have all these bad experience
Bruh THIS THI SHE CARES MORE ABOUT HER PHONE THEN HER LIFE1:02 “ oH TuRn On” if I were her I would be shiting BRICKS
I think she wants it to turn on so she could contact her mother, I think i heard her say something about her mom afterwards
1:20
We all had moments like that don't be ashamed 😂
THIS GIRL IS PHENOMENAL!!!!! She deserves the whole world and more
Yeet
This girl is staying strong
They too her father and her mom died and then they took her little brother oml what else does she even have left 😭😭

IM NOT GETTING ON THE BOAT



*GETS ON THE BOAT*
0:30 *THEY FRIGGEN SAID JAKE PAUL* right
is this syria or england ?
1 Subscription to Potter Fan = 1 Live Saved.
still
True story?
When they took him from her was like she lost her mom all over again
Someone should make a film out of this.
Is this true or are they acting
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Wait. Where is this happening?
Why are people speaking in English? Should not they be speaking Arabic?
I heard jake Paul at 31
XD
I see that Clementine is growing up
Like for the girl
We’re is this happening she’s English is it Northern Ireland or Scotland I’m confused
Yep and this  is happening right now at the middle east
I almost cried😭
I have goosebumps....wait is this real or was it just made up? HUH?!? TELL MEE!! I would cry if it was real but if it’s not still I would cry
I feel so bad for those ppl
what movie is this????????
Lol syrians do not speak british english
its crazy how she basically didnt age the whole video
I lost it when the boy got taken away from her. THAT'S HER ONLY FAMILY LEFT!😭
😭😭
😢😢
how does one help when one can not even take care of themselves
Ok so first of all HOW THE FRECK DOSE HER HAIR STAY SO NEAT IN THAT SITUATION!!! MY HAIR IS A MESS AND IVE DONE NOTHING ALL DAY (I’ve obviously done some things but still u get the point)
1:01 *no u*
0:36 and i will kill you
She's amazing , she should be working on a movie!
How foolish is humanity
-Factories getting money out of war
-Death of innocent lives and nobody seems to care
-Territories and Boundaries
- harassments, inequality, Chaos, Famine, even death.
- There will never be peace (sure there are peace in other countries but not all.)
- Fighting for the Right or Wrong
- Destruction
- Selfishness

But I still believe that there is still love in humanity. Where we stand together as one. Race, age, gender, religion, no matter what. There will always be Love.

It is what keeping us together.

:) (Pls don't hate on this comment it's just my opinion)
@Zack Irahza hmmmmmm mm mm mm.......
Welcome to Communism??
Ah yes. That's what Lenin wants you to think. 🤔
Oh yeah yeah
00:36 -and I will kill you
It's heartbreaking especially when she lost her mom and the boy, who was the only one left for her, leaving.
The truth is we all are in danger but no one can ever escape what follows
that girl should be an actress someday
Prayers
This was sad, as it was supposed to be. The only thing is that for some odd reason, the part when she was asked if they were related and she said, "No. I mean-" made me laugh. I am now confused why that happened.
😢😢😢😢😭😭
Who is filming everthing.
When she is the last lady that carry the whole memes
Wait who are the "enemies" in that war?
Good production
I’ve been even more tramitized
Im soulless... I didnt cry a single tear
OMG..!!!
Fake
is it bad i luaghed at this?
This is depressing... And the reason is not that it's fictional, but that this kind of thing actually happens.
is this a real girl?
This is a movie?
I hate that this is overlooked.
Is this like World War 3 but since Russia blew the life out of the US we only see the perspective of the EU dismantling with chaos engulfing Europe, with a bunch of ISIS insurgents and Russian troops with martial law and stuff
Omg!!!! I wish I could help EVERY SINGLE PERSON that is going through this rn it’s soooo saaadddd!!! 😭😭😭
0:39 she sounded like Arya Stark
I hate to see that this is happening everywhere, I am in a no war zone so I do feel bad for these people
Lady: I will find you

Me: AND I WILL KILL YOU
The girl on the video is a good actress I wonder if someone knows her name
This made me cry so much..
I'm so interested in the story and want it to go on but at the same time that means she suffers more, wish it was just a fiction book
Why does this keep coming up in my recommend? Like years later. Anyway congrats to the girl cos her acting is insane!
It’s 2:00 am and I’m crying.
all around me are familiar faces
0:30 did anyone hear "JAKE PAUL!"
I dont want to be mean but where did the camera come from
It is not real
Nasa
The most dedicated vlogger
1:07 I HATE THAT GUY I WANT TO RIP HIS VOCAL CORDS OUT OF HIS THROAT AND CHEW OUT HIS HEART
In case any of you don't know, I think this is the story of a SYRIAN Refugee.
If you check the setting clearly it is in the United Kingdom, It's probably about a UK Civil war
This is so sad I am actually crying 😭
I really wish I could help these people😥
Is this a real girl and a true thing of this girls LIFE like did she really film this or is it true stuff happening but she is an actress
Fatniss Evereating umm
I think it's obvious
But other than that think in this way
Wouldn't it be weird for syrian people to speak english and watch english programs in television?
Where is hell?
Hell is not down there.
Hell is also not up there.
Hell is around us. Wars, deadly diseases, deadly accidents.
My anxiety is going crazy rright now.
1:28 “he’s all I’ve got left” that really hit me in the feels
At 0:30 it sounds like Lil Jon yelling "Jake Paul"
It is check point because if you stopped video there , there is check point on the wall and if they cross line (between states) ilegally they can fire on you
It sounded more like "kill me" aaahhahhaaha
It sound like


*CHECK PAUL!!* to me
It's sounded more of a CHECKPOINT!
Man this teaser for MW5 looks amazing
Yeah save the children but not rapists
"No english" sorry but i found that sign funny lol am i going to hell jks we are in hell anyways dont come at me im english myself so
i just wanna reverse everything :<
and I complain that I feel depression when there's extra homework
This kind of thing would lead to World war 3
I just realized that she just kept coming back to the same war field
Damn...




Kids cant even get off their phone when their about to drown
she’s trying to contact someone.
Ok boomer
I agree...
The phone works because... ITS NOKIA.
-_-
God my eyes are tearing up this is sad
2k shitass war lovers disliked
When I was 9 I was taken away from my family and ended moving to 2 different foster care homes  my first one was with a woman I didn’t even know and her kids would hurt me and then say it wasn’t them and then I moved to my godparents house and they would call me a liar and a bitch and ignorant and blame me for everything and they would scream at me pretty much every day then I moved in with my sister and it’s only a few more months till my mum sees if she’s guilty for poisoning me but she never did my mom was falsely accused of poisoning me I can see my family whenever I want and call my mum whenever I want and I get to see my mum every month and on Christmas and Easter and me and my twins birthday it’s in a few days and all this happened over the course of almost 4 years but my story isn’t as serious as this...she has gone through hell and so have I but she has gone through worse... I wish I could help I’m only 12 turning 13
Pray, its what you can do at the moment
I don't know if this is true or no but you are very lucky to still be here so live happily and enjoy your life.
i wish you the best of luck with everything
I feel for u I really do but ik that if I was in your situation I wouldn't want pity but I'm really sorry for what u have been through and I hope your life changes around. I'm also the same age as u and ye I have gone through alot but for different reasons ,u must be so strong to speak out❤
*shaggy will save you*
I hope her mum lived
Ugh I hate what is happening to Syria rn it's so sad and unfair we want change!! #Syriawillrise
Rossi girl Channel how tf is israel suffering? show me ONE proof that israel is suffering, i’ll show you a thousand that palestine is the victim.
blue soul are you from lebanon lmao
@blue soul Israel is israel
@Cookie Jar there are also a lot of Syrians in my country but I just thought that maybe the situation got better. But I was wrong
i tried looking through a comment section from Fatima Pacheco's comment, but everyone then started arguing about religion and i got nothing useful from it. so please, is there a way to help this cause? for example, i'm in sixth grade, no money, and i can't leave the house at all.
People go through this every day and some people just don't care
Please make this a movie.
“I’m not getting on the boat without you” where have I heard something along similar lines like that before
0:07 someone pls tell me they’ve also read that book
What's it about? I haven't read it
0:30 y did I hear jake paul
She has my name, my looks, my nationality. It could happen to anyone.
Always when one speaks the truth, it get labelled as propaganda or conspiracy. West idiots themselves make way for Greater Israel Project and Kalergi Plan. They don't even know about the Samson Option and believe there is a thing as PoLiTicS. Everything is under Zionists, you idiots.
It makes you want to beat the hell up and kill who ever caused this because of probably some none sense
01:2 She is thinking about her phone now?!
Hi 
Im from Syria
yeah
this war area where we are the testing mousses 
i lose my uncle ,
my friend , my dreams
this war makes me stronger but without soul

I hope you are going okay. I’m so sorry, I want to help in anyway I can. :(
Pac Tube ❤️
Stay strong and I hope you get through this 
Have hope 🙏
Pac Tube g
At least she lived ❤️
Yea
Juraj H. Yeah it’s not but it’s based on a true story
Yea she is lucky but it is not real

0:57 ''Help me even'' Give me a hand
My eyes arent crying out a puddle
Or a pond
or river
or lake
or a sea

*_-the atlantic ocean-_*
dang. i can't believe this is happening. our world is getting dangerous. i hope everyone stays safe..
Shes could earn some good money with her body so whats the problem?

Beeing a prostitute is one of the oldest jobs in history.
children in war always have an stuffed animal i guess
😭
This is very sad, I honestly hope all of this will end one day
0:30 *JAKE PAUL-*
https://youtu.be/RBQ-IoHfimQ
the same girl
This part 2 is still depressing to see....
I wonder how the camera survived

And the girl
I feel so bad that this is happening..
I hope more People will see this Video ...
What country is this?
She is pretty
😥😥
Lol
There's something wrong with the video.. It gets all blurry and watery from the very beginning.
@cryinqq.inhell I take offense to that ;-;
R/woosh
Wait i just realized its our tears
Yeah. My throat kind of closes up when I watch it.... must be allergic
Its part two
1:30 who saw the L on her forehead?
I know this is supposed to be inspirational and stuff, but how is the phone recording at 0:49?
moonchild it amazes me too brother
SEXEL Gt no I don’t I actually live inside a shampoo bottle, which limits my ability to get and education. Hope this answered your question
Do you even go to school?
Jesus loves u
0:36 I will find you and I will kill you
0:30 jhon Cena
When she said "I'm not hungry" it broke my heart...this is really heartbreaking.
why why why ??? why are people doing this ??? why are they shooting innocent people ??? why ????? what do they get after this ??? why ??
Second part is even sadder than the first... 😭😭
Is she an actor from a movie or... Anyone know her?
Tactical nuke incoming
that’s a dedicated vlogger
Didn't cry at all I'm emotionless (also I ran out of tears from the other video) :/
Can someone tell me how they film these?
Yes
Is this Telltale Series : The Walking Dead Season 5?
Tøxic Gamer Damn good graphics
Clem?!
KuwakaNey, I’m talking to “just a random commenter”
Muff Muff who you talking to?
yeah.. chill we know it’s real and happening.
At the end she probably didn’t remember her parents names
0:30
*JAKE PAUL!*
Poor girl
IM ALWAYS WONDERING WHY THESE DISGUSTING PEOPLE (I DONT THINK YHEY ATE PEOPLE) DO THIS AND THEY DO THIS TO KIDS!
I fell bad for the mom but it's not real right?
She has more important things than filming this
She has more important things than filming this
@Juraj Thank god
It is reality but this video not
Dammmnnnnnnn she's a good actress!
WELL THANKS EVER SO MUCH FOR THE DEPRESSION GUYS, I REALLY NEEDED THAT! :(
My birthday is 15th May too...
Who is cutting onions????
1:14 did you get the reference? Nice
wtf looks like an apocalyptic world where is the other countries help
Bless her and her brother ❤️
*Strong power thank you*
Looks So amazing i want that life my life Is boring with Internet And with nothing else
A girl that young shouldn't have to be a mother figure
She looks much more grown up I hope she escapes and finds safety
*JAKE PAUL*
but this is very sad to see children suffer.
The stare at the end killed me
War is war, it will stay war
I always say:” so sad or so horrible” I am always getting so frustrated because I cant do something about(because I am underage)what hurts a lot and some adults are just looking are what happens in the world but don’t even do a thing☹️😞
Omg shes my age :(
I thought this was a movie......
The saddest part is that it's not the people's fault. Wars between countries don't happen because of the citizens, but they are the ones who have to suffer. Especially the children...
Every children in Syria 😭
She showed sign of regaining emotion, until it all feel down the hole
Who else noticed how she acted just like her mom protecting the child (maybe brother) or saying she's not hungry and stuff like that. I'm so sad.
It’s so sad this happens to children. Anybody really. Also, side note, she is freaking beautiful!
so sad
Where does this take place?
I want a part 3.
How we doing now?
This is terrifying. Why didn't I know this sooner? I could've done something! SOMETHING!
Not gonna lie I shed a tear
Oh my god this is sad
This is....heartbreaking
I question my self how long does the battery of that camera lasts
Poor girl
Thank you for remembering.
ok but why are they white if its syria
Rose it’s not Syria it’s England/ all other countries. To send a message that it can happen here. Even though people fear immigrants that don’t have a choice but to flee from danger.
Wait wait wait  , why are you putting all the rebels as demons ?
Because they are
0:30 jake paul
This will happen to all of us soon...and we can't stop it...
Where dose this take place?
*whai?*
This is so sad, alexa play despacito 2
Wierd flex but ok
For the people who disliked video have no soul
@Shiba how is she acting terrible?? She's an innocent child why would she be punished this way?
That’s right honest person ditto
I don’t care, if you want to come to a country where it’s safe, go through asylum.
She's acting terrible. She needs to be punished.
Heh simple minded people like you only have two pre programmed responses to any given argument. First: "The [insert any given minority group here] are gonna take away our country if we give them rights" Second: "shut up!"
😭
Oh my gosh
0:30
guy with gun: *JAKE PAUL!*
*shoots Jake Paul*
MOVED TO FM THROUGH THE YEARS hHahahsha
It's not happening lol if this was it would be all over TV it's just acting at things that have and will happen in the furture.
The video itself is staged of course (you're delusional if you think you're smart for pointing that out), but the things that happen are real.
Happy birthday-

GET ON THE GROUND

Me: Well fu-
*I MUST NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION BUT WHY IS EVERYONE SAD AND CRYING THIS IS REAL AND I SAY LETS DEPORT THEM TO A BETTER PLACE LIKE CANADA OR GREENLAND OR SOMETHING WITH A LOT OF LAND AND FEW PEOPLE LIVING THERE*
I didn’t expect to cry today
“He’s all I’ve got left”
Oh... oh wow.. that just hits you right in the feels...
Lucy The Lamp it kicked my heart in the balls
True




And that is why you flood your house
Same
@black drink guy gacha life
@black drink guy What about gachastudio?
As much as this is sad I'd like to see a movie out of this as her in it.
Nice water proof phone while filming yourself in the middle of a war
First the dad, then the mum and now the little boy. If you don't wake up now to the refugee crisis, then when?
0:30 is it just me or did it say JAKE PAUL
🥺
part 3 would make me adoot 30 little kids so stop please
I feel bad for the mom
My heart stopped beating for the whole duration of the clip. Heartbreaking.
0:54 there talking dutch
I'm not crying.You are...
Letting through the refugees into your country and become serious issue becoming illegal immigrant to your country and risen social issue or pretend blind, deaf and build wall and didn't let any immigrant came to your country while they suffered to never ending problem solved.

Either way, humanity is dooomed
The wall is way more expensive than dealing with refugees. Racism stops people from thinking.
Who is the camera guys
That's horrible.
Clementine from The walking dead 😢😢
Paedophile
lolicon :v
where the hell did this even happen??😢😭
She's like the girl from Logan.
"He's the only one i got left..." 
That quote made my heart break😭
*0:13** and **1:16** got me😟*
Not that this is not shocking but it's not even that bad compared to most refugees. My parents are refugees and their stories are much worse.
Jesus. I'm so glad I'm not her.







We're 2 days apart in age 😂
I lost it at 1:15 when she said she wasn’t hungry. Her guardian said that to her earlier in the video. It made me think that she cares for the boy as her guardian cared for her. Now she’s like a guardian to the boy and when he left, it was like another part of her family left her. I’m crying 😭
I mean 13
their like Clem & AJ in twd
Reminds me of clem and aj from twd game. First it was lee taling care of her then it was young her taking care of aj. It' beyond beautiful.
@mrbadassmotherfucker ohh..
I thought itu was her mother, because they really looked alike
Woow that was umh..  omg
This is like a movie
Hoodedlias Well it ain’t it’s happening for real
This reminds me of the book refugee
“He’s all I got left”
Oh my god
0:21 the *most* scary part of this video.
the fact she is reading “more than this”, a book about a post-apocalyptic book
No matter how disturbing this is, it is very realistic
I agree save the child refuges but kill the rest.
someone heard the "Get off bitch"?
1:13
*I swear to god, if somebody puts '2018???' I'm going to rip your throat out and personally slaughter your family*
5/8/03 is her birthday
*Can people stop being idiots?*
no one innocent deserves this kind of life
@Bäřty Bøy lel it's grand mate :)
@Jack Pierce lol sorry I thought it said that Hitler was innocent
@Bäřty Bøy did you read my comment correctly? It says hitler *WASN'T* innocent.
It's not there choice
No one deserves this life period.
*nOt AgAIn*


*Starts sobbing like a dinosaur*
* *plays Jurassic Park music* *
how can people be so cruel...
People make differences of their lives
@Lord of Fury Animations lol
Welcome to "THERE IS NO PROTANGISTS HERE" world
People in too much power can't control their selves and become very greedy, selfish, evil and horrible, so cruelty is just a bad feeling in the mind. It can harm many.
Is this real????
Savage Sophie probably
It's so sad that she has gone through so many things in her life.
Warfare is the ultimate triumph of human stupidity
this is so sad i feel so awful for not praying to god how lucky i am to have everything that i own. these videos really do put an impact on so many peoples lives. this should be a movie to teach people what really is happening in the world.
0:30 JAKE PAUL
*who's cutting onion's*
Omg, that is so sad!
While this may actually happen. The recording quality is way too high for it to not be staged. Which is fair because nobody would actually record these things.
Did you honestly think this was real? It's a charity video
The marks humans leave are too often skars
This really makes me feel bad.
Her Brother have a New Family and the Girl ist Now all Alone..?!
I cry😣
You guys make those videos in the right way!
I am not one to get sad about people dying or getting hurt. You can tell me or show me terrible heartbreaking things that happen to people and most of the time it doesn't make me sad or angry. I don't like being around kids, but if they are in danger or something, that's when it hurts my heart
على اساس انتو حيل مهتمين بسوريا وانتو قدمتو شي حلوو ما تفكرو نفسكم بايخين جداااا ؟؟؟!!!!
She 12 noow
1:27 heart just left my chest
And give her an iPhone XD for her broken one
I wanna meet this girl
And so we whatch a video and think we know .
Who else is crying and as emotional as me??😭😭😭
I wish I could help. I really do. But what’s a 15 year old living in America going to be able to do?
Aww...she forgot her parents name
@ThatGuyKnownAsWill I think same
No she just didn’t want to talk about it because she lost them
Who started this war 





*Jake paul* 0:30
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
I thought it was Brexit that started it
Ruined 😂
OMGosh Checkpoint
Reminded me of children of men
My the camera still going?

There's no terrorism in Vietnam.
I wish I can help something.
God blesses all.
Where’s the third one we need the continuation
I’m crying
Kid: May I go on boat by self.
Mom: To not die?
Kid: Yes.
actually sinks like a boss
I hate when people make jokes about suffering.What if your the one who sinks?
oh my god i feel bad for laughing at that-
Checkpoint !!!
I'm a monster for laughing at 0:30 cause i heard "JAKE PAUUUUL"
I hope war stops
Ystävä 703 we as humans have fucked up we want world peace but our presidents want power it’s most likely not happening at this point
It won't stop


It will never stop


It is our human nature


And it will never stop
@•Darkiplier• You seem like an edgelord. The type to support war atrocities. The type that should be executed as which the nazis were during the post WWII trials
circle  War is useless. And until extinction of ideals, then it goes on
@Waawofy 703 you don't get it, IT WON'T STOP. War never stops if you think it does you're an idiot.
Wow. This represents 12 percent of actual refugees from the middle east
There's no such thing as peace. 
Peace can't be maintained.
What can make up for peace, is order.
Nothing can be peaceful, but anything can be in order.
I suppose the best solution is not unity, but order.
In this world there is love and hate. Love is very common in this world.
Hatreds a very bad thing when we hate something that's like wanting to beat somthing up millions and millions of times. I'm so glad that this little girl has survived it all. She lost her mom, her dad, and her so called little brother. It's a miracle that shes still alive. Hopefully she isn't dead right now and to so her family I wonder what she must of went through when she was in this horrible horrible place in time. God bless her. God must keep her safe. She is the toughest little girl I've ever seen.
wow this is incredibly fake
wow this is incredibly fake
The video itself is staged of course *(you're delusional if you think you're smart for pointing that out)* , but the things that happen are real.
you know what is sad ? the fact that people are using videos like this to make money and "help others "  but they  give 10% or less of the donations to the cause you pay for.
Better than nothing
I Would stop making accusations because they might just be making these videos and turned payments off, Plus they can always donate the money they make to charities and why are you jumping to what happens about the money? As long as more people see this and gain respect from it, it doesn't matter what happens to money.
If you work hard  and donate some money they will upgrade the cars  and hire more kids to legaly beg on the streets ffs
But these guys spend 88% on charitable causes
oh my god she's my age
It s Powerful
Made me tear up in anger! You guys wanna help? join the Military.
Fakeeee
The video itself is staged of course *(you're delusional if you think you're smart for pointing that out)* , but the things that happen are real.
The girl and the boy got seperated just like that? Come on its obvious that she NEEDS him. Seriously what is wrong with us.
Still the cutest girl ever
i like the way at the end of the video she stares at me "you better help me"
This real?
Sorry to try and make fun of this but, as I see, that phone is a Galaxy S5, which in fact is water resistant, so idk why it doesn't work
Water resistant =/= Water proof
Tbh I cry everytime when I think what happen in the war because I lost my grandparents when we were trying to run away
I wish I can help them...They don’t deserve this pain! Yes, I’m saying the truth guys! But how to help them?! So sad... Why people can’t to agree their minds and stop wars?! I don’t know...🤕
0:22 to be continued...
why did they record her getting held hostage by a couple of armed people
wot
I wish i could adopt this girl.
0:36 Oh no it's Jason Bourne
0:21 What the hell is wrong with that guy if i was there i'll punch him in the face! >:(
this must be world war 2... i wish i help,
We should force Donald Trump to watch this.
Oh man once a again why im not one of the guys selling weapons. I must be making millions by now.
So this is what gonna happen if we accept open borders a civil war and maybe another world war ??!!
passei aqui só para dizer que bolsonaro ganhou!!!
I really wish I can do something... but idk how to start it, I don’t have the money, and I’m just a kid...
Accept the children and their parents. Refuse young angry solitary men.
save me im a child so save me soomehow
i would just kill my self in that situation
This is still sad. Can we get another 50 likes?
this video is very sad but i must ask if these parts seem a little staged
0:50 who was recording
0:20 how and who recorded this
1:10 this was recorded outside the cage
0:45 this all looks like the same day
0:47 also underwater cameras
1:15 you can see both her hands no were near the camera (unless someone else recorded)
0:08 same thing


at 0:00 she was told happy birthday but at 1:33 he has another happy birthday so it only took 129 days for her (or him) to get a year older
@CorpAgent 

You have a point
Dude, it is obviously fake. It's set in the UK, not a real story of a child in the Middle East
THIS IS soooo SaDDDD
nice propaganda :) the real refugees are: 99,9% bandits 0,1% normal refugees
Who is recording?
1:32 - "today is your birthday.... I hope you made a wish"

The Girl must be thinking: I do have a wish ...I wish to those who destroyed my home and took my father and my mother, to die slowly.


Why the War never ends? because it is in human nature to take revenge, its a retaliation cicle that will never ends.
This video does not represent the reality of people who seek asylum in Europe. The "refugees" we have, are 95% "17-year old" grown men, who cowardly leave their country in the hands of ISIS and other violent groups. Not even 1% of the refugees who travel to European countries are little girls like this one in the video. 

Please remember, that this video is pure propaganda. Open your eyes.
wow could you show some real footage about the people who are comign here in europe for assylum oh yea you cant because they are all 20yo men,war criminals and rapisit
ذكرتني ببعض الشعوب العربية المظلومة.. كفلسطين ، سوريا ،. العراق، اليمن... إلخ ..الله يكون معاهم و مع أي مظلوم..
Brexit
Make this a movie and inspire lots of people
When I grow up I’ll adopt one of these kids
Even if you win the war, you have lost peace. 😢
Humanity must put an end to the war, otherwise the war will put an end to humanity.... 

Pleas like if you agree with me. ❤️
0:30 JAKE PAUL
Now presidebts are thibking about future?when kids are our future..and they can't live in this world cuz its soo uvfull
I hope that kids can live like us
I hope that kids can live like us And you never suffer
Oh my god, I can't believe I never saw the second part until now. It's really heart breaking 😭
Meanwhile in Ukraine...
1 like / 1 percent for her phone
1 comment/ 1 bad guy dies
I want to become Spider-Man and save those people! 😡
Is this ww2
Lol she had it coming
Hahahhaha xd
I like these. Not because of what's happening to the child, nonono, that's just wrong and NO ONE should experience this. I like these kinds of videos because of the story's they tell. They are short, they scare you, but god damn are they powerful.
They go to the country that caused them to have to leave in the first place
omg how did i not know there was a second one </3
This is blatant racist propaganda like the SA farmers thing!
Are refugees White?
This made me even more thankful to live in a safe area. God bless all of you and if your going through a hard time, just know that you will make it out. Have a blessed day everyone.🙂
Looks real
for some reason this didnt make me sad it made me scared
Is she living in sanhok pubg map?
why is this girl’s face makes me more emotional
0:30
it says jake paul
Stop it at 0:30 and there are on the wall check point
@Juraj Eee No?
No check point but yea it sounds like jake paul
Where?
Lmao true.
People who are doing it should know that they are "humans but without humanity"I hate you people 
...
There aren't humans
✝❤
part 3 please
She looks like reviewbrah
are they under occupation or something?
... Lillian is my name.
If I could I will use most of my money to help them or they could stay with my family my sister mom and dad
Hope they die :/
Dang.. Some of those were more than a second
00:30 CHECKPOINT
That’s what happened to me 💔and a lot of people
People dont realize what a crisis were in. People usually respond "we pray for them" when someone ask them how you help.If you believe in god , dont just sit in your home
Thinking that you're going yo heaven just because you pray for them. If you think you're going to heaven just because you "feel bad " for them. You are wrong . You need to make a difference , it does not matter who you are, what religion you believe is true, please help them. Dont just pray. Give money to charity or google "how to help children's in need of care" and you will get a answer. This was not intended to offend anyone , thanks have a great day.☀️
What if she wished war
I wish I could help.
Save the children. Only.
This world is so cruel
Surprising how the camera man survived all of that.
i watched it and now i want to suicide, is that wrong?
SEND THIS TO MESS YOUR SELF
This is so sad i cry
It reminds me of children of men. Great ad made me cry
I guess idk
Part 3

I was happy that she took the small boy with her

She didn't find her mom ever again, did she...
*i feel so bad now..*
Would totally accept them all if they weren’t all young male adults.
Come on every single child in this. Your staying in my house. 😂 I’m sad now

I hope aliens wipe out the whole human race
Her frown makes me sad.
I cried
At 1:14 they replicated the reported who made the man fall
I just want to make a giant cruise ship and take all the children and their parents to U.S and bring them to shelters and foster cares.
#IDontLikePropaganda
Man. That's scary...😨

Even though I'm living in a country that the war has ended years ago but I wish I can help those kind of people 😢😢
When was the peace?
00:36 I will find you and kill you

Save the Children
amazing...
But wait how did she survive all of that
this kicks in the anxiety
Best profile pic ever.
In 2014, she lost her dad. And in 2016, she lost her mum. This always makes me cry...
whoops made me cry in front of all my family
?
They stranded in the netherlands 

"Help even"
that was deep. Great way to show what this world can be.
2000 people are heartless
WHY IS THIS DISSLIKED
IT'S SIMS LIKE THE WALKING DEAD (KLIMINTAINE & AJ) BUT NOT WITH ZOMBIZ IT'S WITH "TERROS" .
this is not real right?
Did this really happen 


Sorry if i offended you
Wait is this film real??? Answer me nowww
No
Nobody never save a chilld,but im will save 😢
16th of May, 1 day before my birthday. She was born in 2003, 1 year before my birth year. That's uncanny
That girl is cute

This always makee me worried as hell.
Bruh my name is lily
I know what its like to get tooken away from your mom....
War most stop!
😭😢
Why couldn't they adopt her too? And it had been 2 years since she saw her dad.
I just noticed how she was put in her mom's place. I wish she had gotten her happy ending.
If only it were real
First she lost her home then her dad then her mom then we’ll her whole life
Another wish?
sad i wish she can find her mom am really sad for her
SHE MADE ME CRY WHEN SHE SAID: 'im not hungry'. because i know she was pretending to give the little boy just a bit extra food
1:09 when the lil boy say “I want my mommy and daddy” when I heard that I felt like someone just stabbed my heart 💔 😪
That poor child I so feel for her bless you and your family ❤️😥
You realize it's acted, right?
Needs a movie
This is really sad
Imagine what could have been of all those kids that got their life ruined like this
Donald trump kept children in cages when illegal immigrants went to America. We people watching youtube are considered lucky.
THESE COLONIZATION COULD AFFECT PEOPLE
Why does everybody fight!? Why could there be no peace!? it's just so frightening! Can someone please stop this wars around the world? there are people who already feel pain and now there's more! She even loss contact of her mom and what will you feel of you're in this situation! War is so stupid! War can bring pain! Lots of inoccents die! Kids could die and kids are really important because they are the people who keeps the years going! I don't know why fighting or killing can bring to a good solution! Can we just sit back and talk about it and not fight!

(Love this video! It's really sad and I really want to cry right now!)
The problems with the refugees is that the majority will never adopt the European values
this is like the apocalypse
yeah bring them in, see if britain doesnt become like this
You idiot Hans
The children should be brought in and Britain won't become like this as long as it is an agressive country participating in pillaging of Middle East that it is right now.
Mom.:"I will find you"

Deja vu anyone?
I can't stop watching this. This is so powerful. The end where she stares into the camera kills me. It's so sad. We need to change the world.
She has the same birthday as me😭
We need á movie of these
Poor kid, even tho its been 2 yrs it doesnt matter pray for those childern
😰😱😭
we need anothe one
World is cruel
Life in a nutshell.
This is normal thing , since the creation of humanity but now that we have internet we can actually see the bad things happening but this is not shock or new , there was always war and pain in the world
@Setix12 the world it's like a survival game, survive or die
@spdoosh that is what being sentient guarantees, but it makes us the most developed.

Somebody get her some rice for that phone 
She’s gotta call her mom 
*GET HER SOME RICE NOW*
Go crawl back into the whole you were born in
GET YOURSELF A LIFE NOW!!!!
Seriously open your eyes, this is serious and you should take it serious
@Charlotte's Web of Thoughts ok boomer
*Stop Making J O K E S*
The last time a white person demands some rice. It didn't go too well....




"WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS MOTHA FUCKA"
It was stupid then and it’s stupid now! Also fake just stop
This is sad
What war was this
Okay now they are just going for the YouTube money.
I don't see any ads
this girl reminds me of Clementine
😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭
I couldn't make eye the contact.
Lol why did they just film and not help them at all?
Oh please tell me you are joking
If I have 1 wish i wound't be selfish and use it on me like i wish to fly, i would wish for everyone to have a happy life with there family and make sure no one gets in a war, get bulled and even more lose there life for something they didn't want to happen! Thats why when ever i get a chance to donate to a charity i donate as much a can. Even if it my pocket money of the week, i probably won't even using it!
I’d use it to do anything conceivable by the human imagination, so that I could fly and fix this
I feel so sprry
ugh. she reminds me a lot of my young cousin. thats primarily why this makes me extremely sad, it makes it even more real
I hope she's seeing her mom again...
This is the real world, Everybody feels sorry but no one is actually trying to change it.
Sad but kinda true... 😔
A sequel to the most beautiful + terrifying video. 🙏
Life of a Syrian kid right there
He’s  all I got left 

This is so sad but this does happen in real life
So deep
*لا اله الا الله*
Omg I cried so hard
Why fear hell when we are already living in it....
Hope this video will change damaged minds
Unfortunately this is our reality of today.
Shouldn't have let her on the boat!
#saveliterallyanyrefugees
This girl knows how to be a mother
*CHECKPOINT*
If i dont get a full series on this we gonna fight
0:30 jake paul!
Who’s the girl dude
OMG The sequel!
I am still nigh confused
Can’t wait for third one next month!!! 

Spoil alert she’s 15
Most badass girl ever!
she was supposed to be born 2003??
She fell into the water and she still had her phone in her pocket. What a legend.
I wish this never has to be a worry for any child but it does bc this world is sooooooooo messed up fighting and war everywhere you don’t feel safe anywhere anymore
Wow this is sad we should be grateful that we are not going through this and you have a roof over your head
Wtf? Why save the kids? They're TRAMATIZED! DEPRESSED! They're suffering, it would be best to put them out of their misery
Do you know what save means
*If me and my friends casted for the walking dead*
Can someone explain
0:30
JAKE PAUL!
CHECKPOINT!
JACKPOT!
This is the best video ever
When the president bans video games
This world is not perfect but I wish it was.. why. Why is there guns, murders, and every why can we all love each other in peace.
0:30 *JAKE PAUL!*
This is so sad but powerful. 💞😔
This video went from 1 to 100 in half a second.
i wish the mom got out with her 😔
0:29 Well, I live in the North East so I could easily have been dead by now.
1:15 this is from that incident in Hungary
Great. More propaganda
0:21 Breaks my heart. A daring war fighter touches her? Shoot him.
Is this based off of real events
No thanks, I don't want your trash in my country. You can keep your Syrians.

But if there's a war in Britain then I'd gladly help the Brits to come here, I'll even give them food and a place to sleep.
I do not get it
Part 2
Why should we care tho 
Logic>Morals
It feels like I'm playing the *last of us* again .....
This is so sad for the child and I watch the first vid 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
It makes me Happy because UK was destroyed
*C H E C K P O I N T*
What disturbs me the most is 1:07
It says "no english/ pas d'anglais" on the graffiti in the background, and every european has probably seen graffiti like this about refugees. Imagine fleeing from your country (which no one probably wanted prior to war breaking out) and arriving at a safe place, as a target of hatred, just because people can't stand foreigners. Way too real and way too sad.
Is this ww2
No *THE LAST OF US*
Oh my god. That's so awfull
this made me cry
@Olivia WolfFam I said f*** you and have a f***** up ******** I ********** bitch go suck my **** you peace of *************** *****  ********

#AllLivesMatter
Is this Ww2?
She's ok!
Let’s take a moment to think,

What about the guy who’s been filming her this entire time
"He's all I got left." 

BREAKS MY HEART SO MUCH.
I just realized during the part where the phone won't turn on, theres the long beep of the thingy flatlining
Who’s recording these?
No human should go through this except the ones who started it.
0:30 Jake Paul started this
Hope to see more of these videos
0:30 i knew Jake Paul could cause the end of the world
(Just trying to lighten up the mood)
Its like some howtobasic style editing, 




*maybe editor is howtobasic!*
Why did the mom had to leave?
Here in serbia/nis, i never saw anything happend like that, people screaming and holding you as hostage? Never expirenced that in my life
rekt
im sorry
At least you have something to brag about
I was thinking it is zombie apocalypse 😂😂😂
Even more powerful than the last one.
Nevermind I found it

https://youtu.be/RBQ-IoHfimQ
rohit shubham i was actually looking for the first one when I wound up here. Do you have a link?
I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I had to let go of my little brother like that, *cries*
Well start with you own country first. They didn't take much refugees.
this is an example of what will happen if memes are banned.
Aditi Srivastava no its pretty funny 
Uhhhh those refuge kids should uninstall life tbh
Yes
WTF bro. I know this is a joke but like it's kinda serious. Just say you were that girl and some time later you look at a comment saying " this is what will happen if memes die", I  pretty sure you'd be pissed like I know I would.
I find it utterly disgusting and ridiculous how people on the internet are the complete opposite people in person.
Well then stop bitching and man up...
@Grizzly no
Is it your first day on the internet?
Can we have zombies instead?
I got shivers when I saw the angel of the north on fire for some reason
I’m late on this but these videos create a story, and it’s heart touching, why though? Why did this have to happen?
Is this ww3 if finland wins this time??
Enemy spotted.
16 may 2003 same bday as me
I cried when I heard the flatline at 1:02
I wished they made another video of this.
Is it what the France did?😢 I HATE MY COUNTRY!
I am shookn’t
This Is Cruel. I Can’t Do This.
I’m crying
produced by michael bay
What war does this take place in? Sad af tho
This poor girl has lost everything. We need to stop this children nor adults deserve this. No person in this world deserves this.
White people don't beg to be let into brown people's countries. The entire premise of this video is a lie.
Is this real??????
Reminds me of the book Refugee
(mostly mahmouds story)
Can we do another one😂
This is like a saga now is she going to find her mom
This may be one of the most effective adverts I have ever seen. Amazing
This is what will happen to the Uk in the next 20 years.
yup, too many refugees in the UK that won't respect the British values. Its a ticking time bomb same may happend with France, Germany, Sweden
Feels like war of the world's
Who ever disliked this is a horrible person
or maybe they just.. didnt like the video!
This is so sad, just watching this video it makes me think all the bad things people have been through. And are still going through.
❤
pls make this a movie :(
An eye for an eye and the world goes blind

1.9k Dislikes?....... hUh?
I save only child and women why we should help men .
This is why I don’t believe in god
This is crazy. But if dis futage was real wow did they made it. Sorry for my englisch😂
why cant we all just get along? its not that hard.
Because immigrants import their extreme ideology into country their immigrating into. Most middle eastern country see woman as tools and people that will do anything for their God. There are some individuals that behave like normal human in society and I think they have right to freedom. But ones that commit violence and harass women get public attention and  people's perspective change. The video shows British girl in France. It portrays immigrant girl escaping from war like ones from Syria. The thing is United Kingdom and France are allies with same religion that doesn't promote violence. But Middle eastern countries have no strong ties to most European country and their religion promotes violence. I'm not saying just let girl die. Just choose wisely between grown man with heavy religious beliefs and girl who has future.
I mean, when people think hanging people for eating food differently is normal, a little bit of Democracy has to kick in
It's funny you think the world works like that.
@Checho_125 pensaste en las proporciones?
Is This true?
0:30 who else heard Jake paul?
Poor girl
Is this real?
its real and happening right now just not in developed countries. The girl in this video is acting but the message is that what is happening to refugee children across the world could happen to you at any time
Somebody make this into a movie
I can’t believe these people used to have the largest empire in the world.
This is potraying countries that usa is invading.
ok
omg move to my country kids
You see... there is problem the amount of man in their twenties is bigger than kids
why is this not a movie the girl is incredible
Momoko Asuka well something similar will be the book “escape from aleppo”
It should be. How about with the girl from Jurrasic World Fallen Kingdom?
@Katy Elizabeth yea i looked🤔
@Juraj She was in Call The Midwife and I recognised her so I looked on IMDb
00:36 I Will find you *and I Will kill you*
0:30 JAKE PAU-
One of these children that is STARVING to death right now can really change the world by using their imagination but sadly we really can’t reach out to them, but what we can do is sending hope to them.. I wish everyone can stop for a minute and really consider helping or donating some money to these children out there.
0:49 boi she spent a full 24 hours underwater
Checkmate MrBeast
Yeah it's hardly a second a day, unless she spent a day standing in the same position with her mum arguing
0:30 it's *check points* u can see on the red board
May 16 is my birthday!!!!
This really makes me sad just thinking that this is actually happening to someone in this world
Lovely Lavender But it IS happening though?
@Lovely Lavender yeah they are !!!
anime X anime that’s great!
I hope they are very happy together!
@Lovely Lavender  don't worry my dad helped him and now he work as taxi driver and he is married to my cousin and they are expecting a child
anime X anime I’m so sorry that happened to your friend:(
I hope he is ok now
my god i'm crying
I apolagise but i saw her reading More than this in the beginning of the vid nd das one of my fave books everr so i just appreciate that lil detail
Can i have part 3 please?
I’m still watching this😫😫😫😩😩😩😢😢😢😭😭😭 So sad!! And at school for 2 years ago our class saw this and many in my class starter to cry😭😭😭😭😭😭
Use edit
Started*
Watched the first video its the truth didnt want to watch more...
And now here i am watching the second one... Fml
People asking what they can do and others replying "anything more than prayers." Let one believe if they do. But you can not vote for dumb people and donate (not money if not asked) and try to make peace. If no example is set how will they see the future?
A child is a child no matter refugee or not
@puca So let me get this straight, because they are young men, you want to send them back to a war zone?  They don't want to kill, they want to escape the violence and live a peaceful life.  both men and women deserve an equal right to life.  They can't sort out the problems, they're plumbers or scholars or librarians, not soldiers.  They are just frightened people who don't want to die.
@TarTar Sauce Who are you calling idiotic? You can't even make a sentence.
puca On everyone’s perspective you are idiotic cause don’t care about child
puca 
Sir, if we strive for them now. The question is where would children and women live? 
That why they need Europe as they refugee so they don’t get killed
This couldve been a movie.
imagine leaving your mom and being in her situation
:(
Make movie, please
C. M. Lol I don’t think you understand the message
When h don’t have the power to help anyone😣😓
I feel bad for her. If I ever met her, I’d immediately want to become friends!
1:38 "Bish tf?! I did dis in da last video where I say I have no wishes, and you is still asking?! Bish tf wrong with cho ass?! I wanna escape!"
Guys I'm not trying to joke. This is kinda just my interpretation of her face. If anything, when I mean escape, I mean escape the madness going on in the video. I doubt anyone would want to be held at gunpoint as a child.
Trying to escape school. No you need that, and a hell lot of it.
@Dead _Cacti 
I know.
0:30
Am I the only one who heard them say Jake Paul?
What is this video even about?
¿It's this the new The Division 2 trailer?





.

Don't hate me, I know it's a cruel joke.
Thank goodness this happened 2 years ago,

But things like this still happen today.
Ğ
Oh wait this is the continuation of the other one!
I'm even more scared now.
kinda looks like ellie from the last of us
*Oh geez...my eyes are now a pool*
A ocean😭
Stop or you might drown the kids
Heh kinda funny...
Adopt a kid
Yeah go on
;( this is too sad
she's a war clementine
Pussy
Damn man!
Is this real??
Yes however it's happened in Syria...
This sets a example how people will care if it happened in Britain, but not in Syria...
Except its dirty rapists. Not a human.
Wow this is so sad 😭 
Can we hit 50 likes?
no
It lost me halfway through
When she looks you in the eye...
This video really made me want to donate money to soft Jihadi cells and invite thousands upon thousands of men from completely different countries into mine
Kinda true but we should at least save the children
She is older in this one
I'm still like HOLY SH*T
0:07 hey i love that book! :D
It's time for someone to make a movie... I rest my case
I actually feel so bad I couldn’t ever imagine being a child in Syria whoever started this war needs to go to hell and worse 😤😤😟😖
Im just wondering what those right wing scum bags would do if they where in a situation where they need to flee their country and then get denied.
It sad but what got me mad is that the only time she cried was when her phone wouldnt turn on...
Damn again
She was reading the book called More than this. Its a message guys, a message.
0:30 They see Jake paul so they kill him. ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌
Jake paul! *kils jake paul*
Just respect this dude. At least he had made people laugh (including me, so thank you) despite all the sadness...
The best
Oh god I needed this i'm bawling my eyes out
I hate to be one of those people, but war is so incredibly stupid. We're still so damn primitive, it's unreal.
Syria Refugee Crisis. Look it up. (For all the people who don't know what this was)
If only there was some way of converting likes to money
Jesus give this girl a break!
I still wouldn't help her if she were to come in my home and ask me to help,and im sure that's what the majority of ppl would do
Finally she's happy




Sees end: oh God 😭
saw you, ends game and logs out
I am living for nothing. For me, this is actually so exciting to be escaping from war and I feel so bad for the girl, wish I could swap with her
movie movie movie. i know its about real life and its terroble. but it could be a movie!
I would watch this if it was a full movie
Oh gosh dang it there’s another one
What is happening in this video
🙏 Open boards To Israel 🙏👶👦👧👩👨👴👵
#SaveTheChildren!
1:07 this type this type of a man that refused the refugee migrant
The first one is sad this is sadder she actually understands what's going on know and she's alone
0:22 this is horrible
Every time I cry when I watch this
0:30 vs Deji
Why and what happened? I don't really understand this
If this actually happened in a first world country the whole world would probably be in chaos too not just a specific area like the Middle East. How are u gonna save the children then?
;-;
Tem um olho na minha lágrima
It stills popular
This is fake.
This makes me so freaking sad
War is happening and America needs to be saved despite trump, because if war happens, what if they miscalculate and a bomb or missile hits us Canada it will be hell
What's the actress name?
I almost couldn’t watch the whole thing 😢
she's so beautiful it breaks my heart for children to be broken
She's great. Hope she continues acting.
Only gamers will understand
Such a powerful video, sadly the ending is not better, especially her face at the end. 
 P/S: Also do anyone know her name?
Try to go to Syria and tell them you are Christian. They cut your head off
Can't say what I want I really want to, such a bummer. 
However, this is sad.
Poor thing
They fucked up Serbia. I hope they will all die
She lost her parents....
War is so cruel...
Who  is recording it..
I know it's acting and they did a terrific job, I just want to wrap my arms around the young girl and comfort her.
War..... war never changes
:c
Is this real or fake
I am crying rn this is so sad this is the first time I cried in 3 years this is just so emotional
I reaaaaaally want a continuation
Are charities rigged to make all your donations go to the founder’s paycheck?
This makes me want to run out and DO SOMETHING
When will “Forever The Most Shocking Second A Day” comes out?
Directed by Michael Bay
This hurts so much to watch
When does she get into prostitution...
This is so tragic, I wish not for this to happen anymore quite sad and painful poor girl is broken and by broken I mean broken she is numb.. we need to put a stop to these wars and everything please.. This makes me sick on how people can do this to each other.. please  think and have common sense people..
haha funni
Migu Pinto OK I get it
@mary princess Boa how can we deal with tragedy if we don't find ways to make us happy? i know it's not a joke, i have absolute respect for any war victim. but we can choose to just be sad about it, or try to make others laugh. i perfer option 2. i understand and respect ur opinion, tho
Migu Pinto it is not something to be joking about imagine it  happening to you
In his dark room he is finally alone
with spools of suffering set out in ordered rows.
The only light is red and softly glows,
as though this were a church and he
a priest preparing to intone a Mass.
Belfast. Beirut. Phnom Penh. All flesh is grass.

He has a job to do. Solutions slop in trays
beneath his hands, which did not tremble then
though seem to now. Rural England. Home again
to ordinary pain which simple weather can dispel,
to fields which don’t explode beneath the feet
of running children in a nightmare heat.

Something is happening. A stranger’s features
faintly start to twist before his eyes,
a half-formed ghost. He remembers the cries
of this man’s wife, how he sought approval
without words to do what someone must
and how the blood stained into foreign dust.

A hundred agonies in black and white
from which his editor will pick out five or six 
for Sunday’s supplement. The reader’s eyeballs prick
with tears between the bath and pre-lunch beers.
From the aeroplane he stares impassively at where
he earns his living and they do not care.
Visiblement la france est associée à un pays raciste n’accueillant pas les migrants... c’est dommage car ce n’est pas le cas et même si il y a des abus cela fait des années que notre pays les aides, que les français les aides. Certes, le gouvernement est très con à ce sujet mais les français aides ces gens, de nombreuses personnes travaillent dans les refuges ... Merci de ne pas représenter la france par des connards de facho ...
At least Adam died😂😂
This is not our problem
OMG!!
0:40 i hear a baby cry
Oh my gosh I am bawling my eyes out
i dont understand how do they have a camera in every time that something like that happens.Can someone explain pls?
i know unfortunately ;(
MrAlmightyPanag you do know it’s not real
Save the children of Donbass from the Ukrainian army. Save the children of Syria from the American army. Save the children of Iraq from the United States.
@The Dolphin Queen Well, duh. Russia helps Donbass fight off Ukrainian armies.
Мария Шинкарева Do you really think Russia has no part in whatever's happening in Donbass? I'm outta here then
@The Dolphin Queen And whose armies are those, huh?
Мария Шинкарева There is a war, though it's waged not by Ukrainian armies.
Мария Шинкарева ok I’m was commenting like I was on THAT side of YouTube because I was just on That side
I remember the times that *I* personally washed up on shores, from a war where no one cared if I held a camera to my face, with the camera still in the same place.
Harssment starts from the school to the end of your life it's all because people are selfish arrogant good for nothing doing things which they think that is just a humor but it is not .
ყლე
OMG I have the same age as her
Her eyes in the last scene makes me have goosebumps... They're so haunting 💔😭
This makes me cry. War will never be good.

Top notch acting.
I'm Lebanese so I know how severe this stuff is this is real and is happening right now.
The last of us
Hope the third one will never be created.
Couldnt imagine living like this.
omg she kept her camera dry when she fell off that boat... vlogging queen! jake paul is shaking!
Ah, yes, because the Irish (Irish Irish, not northern Irish) hate the Brits enough to reject them. And can’t forget all those British refugees bringing their knives and trucks of peace wherever they go...
I'm glad I'm a Christian.
I feel like i have the most comfortable life in the world. I feel like i need to help these children.
✝
This is so sad, now I can't sleep
Propaganda using children,so pathetic
this is so sad. alexa..
Despacito
:(
How can I donate something?
This broke my heart
It happening everyday you know...you guys didnt even know about it
Very hard.
embarrassing propagation
 ...
I feel so uncomfy omg I'm sad and angry 😭😭
Why this story is like the walking dead season 4.
Sometimes YouTube's Recommendation Goes Hillerious
Is this a true story?
Her birthday is the same as mine....
What's the name of this actress? Great perfomance
People are ignorant.Even if the video spark some awareness,it still great video.
Oh god, please make another one where it goes happy again.
I liked the 1st version better. This one is too cheesy and dramatic
Where is this happening?
can we get our selves a child abuse version?
I don’t really understand it... but I know it’s really sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can anyone explain it to me?!?! Also is it real?
Tina Ni watch the first video first
Tina Ni this video is like a mirror of what has happened in Syria only the victims of war are British. there is a part one and that might make this one easier to understand
Arrêtez de confondre. La grande majorité des migrants de fuient pas la guerre mais la merde qu'ils ont eux-même fait dans leurs pays. Il ils viennent chez nous plutôt que aider leurs propres pays à se reconstruire
I want to show this video to a foolish Japanese
I live in the states so... suck for y’all! Lol
This is Europe in a few short once ;)
World war 3
Anne franks Modern
this is a bit autsitic
Sad 😢😢😢😢
Wow
The last of us
SHE IS GROWING UP
PART 3!
ommg nooo this was even more sad i cant watch this anymore
Then racist fuckboys cries about immigrants causes the rising crimes here in America, then Trump the KKK appeared, commenced the mass-deportation & zero tolerance. Here the fun fact, Trump and rest of racists are the causes of problem.
Well oof again, it seems like I hit a nerve there. Which means that I was right, you are indeed hispanic, funny how you are the perfect embodiment of the stereotype, don't you think? Although I would be lying if I said that I was surprised. Anyhow you made two assumptions here that are wrong. First, my account's profile picture isn't me, it's a picture of a gipsy and you are a horrible racist for insulting his thick skull. And second you don't have to live in the USA or any other English speaking countries in order to know proper English. That is the case for me as English is my second language and I speak it better than you despite the fact that I don't use it in my everyday life, quite pathetic from you isn't it? How can we properly understand each other if one of us can't even write correctly? Thats the whole point of bringing up your poor english skills, not the half-assed excuse that you made of me shutting you down. But I guess I shouldn't have expected better from an individual whose IQ is in the single digits. But lests have a conversation about you political beliefs and why I think you are in the wrong, its because they aren't factually based but ideologically based. You believe the narrative that best fits your interests and not necessarily the one that is closer to the objective truth.
Well oof. It seems my advice didn't manage to penetrate your thick skull because your english is even worse than before. So much so in fact that I can barely understand what you're saying. This asides though. So here is the thing. Presumably you live in the USA, your english is broken and you hold extremely leftist political views. Are you hispanic?
"My intentions weren't to shut you up or whatever, I simply pointed out that a person that cannot properly form sentences shouldn't be taken seriously when it comes to politics(or anything else for that matter)."

Yes, you were, since you brought up the English, here in internet. :P 

"But if that is your way of deflecting what I've said then you are not only piss poor when it comes to constructing sentences but your comprehension and expression abilities are also very much lacking. Well here is a good quote for you and your situation."

"“It's better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than open it and remove all doubt” - Mark Twain"


Here the "specific" (?) political; you should've be tutor for your leader since he legitimately has errors his English. Oh of course, you are one of supporters deranged like Ice Posiden.
How am I shutting you up? You seem pretty capable of replying back. My intentions weren't to shut you up or whatever, I simply pointed out that a person that cannot properly form sentences shouldn't be taken seriously when it comes to politics(or anything else for that matter). If you want on the other hand to have a conversation on those specific political statements so be it.
ugly motherfucker lmao. Shutting me up isn't clever, Lil girl. 
"Someone telling the truth. Reply him about his sentence. That would shut him up." Over the internet. Is YouTube an English forum to you, no? Sound likes bringing up the English to shut me up over the truth. 

Ohh look at those fancy constructed sentences. Oh no I've should be afraid.
How dare they separate her from her little friend?
Sad
1 like 1000 prayer 🙏
Not as good as the first
Why am I watching this? WHY IS THIS REALITY? STOP THE WARS!
See if everyone didn’t have war it wouldn’t happen
Who is this girl, who always makes me emotional.
She works for the rich & powerful that want to persuade public opinion to bomb Syria in the interest of Israel & regime change. The same people who tricked us into invading Iraq

@Viporal im reporting you! your way too sexual for this get lost scumbag
Import the third-world, become the third-world.
0:22 i guess this guys just atracted to boys and girls
Children of Men vibes
dont just save children, have humanity
These two videos are heartbreaking, but I don't know how to help...
like it or not but this is the definition of propaganda
Technically yes it is propaganda, but it is truthful propaganda.
@Blue Wonder 
are you stupid lmao
of course it's faked, it's meant as a re-enactment.
Dude, the entire video is faked. If you can't see past the lies, then you are truly ignorant. Example? Camera under water. Planes flying so low and if you look at the video frame to frame, the planes are literally dropped and dragged in. The explosion was also fake as well. So are the smoke. Additionally, this girl isn't even Syrian.
It plays on emotion by simplifying the situation to the perspective of one sufferer. It's a narrow way of looking at it considering migrants can be a drain on resources for countries not properly equipped to deal with them. It also pushes the narrative that anyone who points that out or takes any kind of stance on limited migration is somehow against helping children or is racist or xenophobic which just isn't the case. At least it's not always the case.
Depends on which side you ask
Ok, the first one was powerful, but you’re dragging it out too long now. It didn’t need a part two. It got its point across with only one part.
you know... Maybe there's no hell. Maybe we're already in hell.

edit 2; when i say animals, in my opinion, i think that all animals matter and that none deserve to be killed, but i think animals that 'you don't see everyday' are the ones that are killed/known to be killed. This is just my opinion so don't come for me 🙃

I wish this was a movie
I saw her walking around and played gun sounds
At 0:30 all I heard was 





JAKE PAUL!
So scary  for me of Russia  attacking us and China to

Did you hear Jake Paul 0:30

I've been surprised that how emotional i get on a half minute video..

#SavetheChildren
This is a very powerful and inspiring video. So far it you have made these every two years. How about another one?
I'm tired of this migration propaganda.
that’s my birthday omg
This is so sad :(
1:23 alles flüchtet nach Deutschland
I always think that hat is syrias fault for the war
👏 It's 👏 Israel's 👏Fault👏
Children.
Deserves.
Better.
WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO
Fighting never does anything
Why wouldnt the adults be Saved too cuz if theres no adults, More children dies
And still I am thinking to go to the us army
*When a saw the girl*

Me: *SAVE THE CHILD!*
</3
I'm crying as I watch this.
Powerful. Everyone should watch this and really think about how wrong things can get in these situations.
I cried 😢
😭😭😭
0:30 JAKE PAUL!
is this fake? if it isnt IM DEAD INSIDE
They took her brother from her , thats fucked up
I've been through a lot in my life, but none of it compares to what this girl has gone through. Sending prayers to her. I hope she will be okay.
0:29
I literally live 2 minutes away from there😭
This reminds me of the book The Sky Is Falling.
I almost cried
Powerful...
What country is this supposed to be
It's supposed to be Syria in Britain. To show that it can happen anywhere. But I doubt that America will bomb Britain -_-
DaNs PiStAcHiO TaCo 
Syria is more dangerous then tea drinking country (I call it like that no offense)
somewhere in britain
Olivia SHARKEY 
Syria with border with Turkey
Its sad that this is actually happening. why can't our world just be in peace . Kids are dying everyday because of this. Someone needs to stop this madness ;c
this is so sad
Thats the ending make a part 3 plz like if you argee
0:30 JACKPOT OR JAKE PAUL OR CHECKPOINT
someone copied you :)
hope it will be on movie
Why people destroy the world they making
that is my favorate vadeo ever
1-3 seconds a day
I wish I could help people like them but I don’t know how
@Moh. El yeh because everyone forgets that besides the need to expand territories and resources... religion and faith will always be the core reasons why such atrocities occur in the first place 🤦‍♀️
@Some Green Boy 
God you people are so arrogant in what you believe, you have literally no proof that he exists. Respect our beliefs and we'll respect yours, stop acting like you know the secrets of the universe.
speak on it and spread awareness or donate to charities
I heard Jake Paul 0:30
This is similar to twd clementine story omg
This reminds me of d day
Not just the children.
I wonder what happened to her mom. it's sad that she didn't get on with her😔😟😢😭
1:36 my parents name is JEFF LOL IM DEAD
Oh my God. This kills me that people all around the world are suffering and being separated from there parents. Just because Isis was made in Syria doesn't mean other people have to suffer from this too. Why can't everyone just get along? It's because of trump. Trump is racist and cruel. He probably doesn't even realize this is happening to many people right now. He only cares about money. It's sick. Yet people still support him. So many missles and bombs are flying around that the world is just crumbling apart by the second. Earth is basically a wasteland now thanks to the bombs and explosives.😓
in Cyprus a war might happen
The broken are the more evolved.
Are These Zombies???
She's so pretty
So sad
A nuke
She is alive
Happy birthday to you...
Just try to be a human, not an animal.
Yup, propaganda.
Taking in real refugees is alright, as long as they return once things have settled down in their homeland
0:30 who else heard Jake Paul
who didn't, as soon as I heard it I busted out in laughter 😂
It was checkpoint
OMG! YES!
So thats what the war was about... jake vs logan
I didnt hear it until you said it.
This made me cry
Sad to see (her birthday is the same as mine) but that's not the point. So sad.
this is just a video of people escaping their country from war which makes them refugees and everyones feels sorry for this fake vidoe. but when this happens daily in other countries nobody cares and instead wants to kill them or get rid of them when they simply want to escape war and live in peace.
Who is the girl in this video ?
Lmao this was funny
Come on MURICA
Is syria's fault
We can't save wakanda now.
Is tjos animated gosh dang!
Its a sad thing i watched this on my birthday and i dont really now croatia or balkan states are gonna get attacked cause we are small
Is this real
Plz make another i need to see what happens
I'm very sorry about that and I would want to help you 😩😩😭😭😥
Everything goes worsen except the camera, wonder how much strong was the girl
I love you I hope you serviive take care
This is sooo sad 😔😭😔😭😢😢😢😭😭
1:07 "you scum" got me so much. These children and people have been through so much and barely survived, only to be threatened and treated like aliens once they are actually in a safer environment. It breaks my heart.
Humans will be their destruction
This is Jewish propaganda most refugees are grown men for God sakes
I wanna help her
😭😭😭😭😭
That thousand-yard stare at the end tho.
I'm crying
oh my God I'm doniting
Cutefnafshipper Cutevr-chatytlover “donating”
I really dont want this to happen to anyone
Shocking I don’t want to live through that
Have you ever tried applying with any help organizations? Their requirements are insane!
This gives me chills..
This is what Palestinians are facing every day.
Oh good😥😥 that is so hard to me but in the true
This is what palestinians are facing everyday.
What is the story behind this like the world ending or Zombie apocalypse like What
This is an ad showing the daily lives of the children in Syria. They are suffering, dying, starving.
lmao they deleted their reply
I mean, its not as stupid as your grammar.
I think it's a civil war in the UK
She has oné birthday kills she dad two birthday she kills mom And 3 birthday IS alone
If I had millions of dallars I would donate to the people who need it like my mom and dad and my lil brother and big brother and all the homeless people on the earth
I want a part three. The issues this is talking about are so important
meh.. after watching about warsaw in 1944, I have no emotions for this one :/
This is extremely terrible.
Even if that happened in England I’d still stay and fight for my country
STOP THIS NOW SHE DID NOR DESERVE THIS LIFE SOMEONE STOP THIS NOW I CRY EVERY TIME I SEE THIS
I find these entertaining and interesting are yall gonna make a part 3?
dfw.talia - “entertaining” yikes 💀
They should do another one when she’s an adult
Can we see her become a child soldier off her face on gunpowder and cocaine. that would be brutal.
Pls don’t let this happen any more 😔😞😫
god, no. please no.
how did u put this together??
I wish this will never happen to us 🙏
Watching with captions helps you catch more of what’s going on.
Por que no se viene a Méxicoooooooooo xd
Partyshadowfox Nada que ver con Trump, son problemas internos...

War is the only way

0:30 “ Jake paul”
When I herd:
“I will find you”
I almost burst into tears
Wow. This is even more emotional than the previous one .
Well done 👍👌✌
What happened to the crying baby on the boat?
well this would be less depresing if there was a black child
Still on the dark side of YouTube where my memes and weird videos
hi. i am a child... i will try to save my kind...
hello
*cries to hard*
:0
This made me cry
“He’s all I got left” that broke my heart 😭 💔
Why is this happening
All those people who disliked this have no feelings for people going through all this
I'm a tween, how can I help, TELL ME HOW I CAN HELP
😢😢
Is this a story about British girl escaping her country after migrant crisis?
No it’s supposed to show a role reversal with an English girl being put through trauma after there was an attack on her country. It’s supposed to show you that no child should have to go through something like this.
No, this is what it would be like if civil war broke out in the UK like it has in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.
No syria...right?
No dumbo, this is a fictional history, how it would look like if Briton countries attacked each other and war broke out there. How the children would have to live and why we have to save children in the warring countries right now.
It will be in a couple generations.
she has the same birthday as me
Oh wait, no that’s a different one lol
I remember this
We have to be thankful that we are safe in where we live, but we must pray for all the people that are suffering out there, we should also help them, and it will be over soon
Bess her and her family
No child should face this..😭😭
This is so sad
This made me cry
I keep crying.. This shouldn't happen to children! But my family still donate money to people and country who need's it
I’m lucky to be here right now millions are going thriough that.
If i saw the girl. I would buy her one of those waterproof phone bags.
Omg that made me cry
War can go on and just eat a stinkin sea urchin, I seriously just want to meet this girl and give her a hug.
Why we shouldn't kill civilians? They are one of most valueable part of each country's defence - food supply, medical aid, industry. Destroying civilians firstly makes enemy's army hungry and poor supplied. It's simplest way to win.
AND HER FRIEND WAAAAAA
I want there to be a movie but WHY IS THIS SO SAD SHE LOST HER MOM
DUDE I AM 10 YEARS OLD AND STILL HELPING PPL I DID PAY 20K TO THE CHILDREN OF MY MONEY !!
I never cry but
What is this girls name ?? And is this real or is it just acting
Please save these children in disasters! PLEASE GOD
This video was filmed in London correct? I recognize it ! Well at least the first video? It's all so familiar!
Is this real? I’m scared😫
I wish I could make a video as good as This! It's heartbreaking! This sent me crying! I can't live knowing that there are children out there like This! Like if you agree this should make a change! Make a third video! it would make me even more sad. And help me try and find a way to help I have no money to donate. 😭
Im from syria 🇸🇾🇸🇾
I feel bad for all those kids still left in those refugee camps it's terrible how other people do this to humanity! Please make a third video! I am only 12 years old but I will try to help!!!!!! May Allah be with you all! How I would feel if this girl was in this war and the video was real!!! Is it real?? I don't know! It looks real! I wish I could help but I have no money and I don't live near there! And she is a great actress! Congrats on winning awards and all! I wish I were that good at acting! Everyone tells me I can't do it! Good job it's so realistic!
We need to make Earth great again
What the fu**k is happening to the world
terrible!  that why I support TRUMP  he supports and will build a safe    neighborhood/ area in this innocent little girl country  protected by troops so these families are not split up .
Oh god this is bad i wish this can chage
I wish my brother and dad is coming from war ;( i wish they didnt died ;(
we live in a society
We all die
0:30 JACKPOT
م فهمت
Que bugado maluco!!!
continue of horribleness
continue of horribleness
It kills me to say but I cried WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD SOMEONE NOT CARE THAT THEY COULD DIE OF THIS I MEAN LIKE REALLY IF U REALLY DON'T CARE THAN U ARE A F*&%ING B*&%
Galaxy Glasses Get of the internet kid.
Because. It. Is. Not. Our. War. We won't ruin our countries sovereignty for something someone else did.
The instead of screaming and insulting people in a YouTube video go and do something yourself
Angel of the north idiot burnt so this is fake
10:00 Missing: Dad and Husband...
She grew up so fast....Oh wait! I think we have the same age!!! Eh IDK?
These always make me cry..  The world can be such a cruel place..  Sometimes heauitful...  But  not in times like these when people are being hurt
Why do i feel like this is like a clementine thing here
1:00

Girl: THIS WONT TURN ON!!!! WAHH


Me: This is how I will totally feel in the situation l
humans that are bad or evil should go to hell to do bad things with demons and nice or good people should go to heaven with god and angels
Got to be honest. Some of this seems a tad dramatic. Likes it the end of the world. But it does prove its point. That there are children that need help.
0:22 whats going on?
1.8k people that disliked this video has no heart
My main character in my series is based off this girl
Is this fake
Who made this? Agency, filmmaker?
This so powerful :,<
1:14 GET UP BITCH
Children of Men vibes
This is powerful as heck
It hurts when they take little Arthur away from her 💔
0:21 wow that must be very disturbing
The horrifying thing here is that the girl has probably suffered atleast one or multiple rapes...
@Dead _Cacti But *you* don't know what he could have done to her...so you can't be sure that he was trying to do sexual abuse or not.
I think that may be ISIS or the Taliban.
Alex .b   Thats my own opinion..it was a sign that psychos like him do..
If you dont agree its okay im fine with it i dont wanna argue cuz i dont really have time for that
need part 3
Россия принесла на украинскую  землю войну! Прямо сейчас в Украине гибнут дети.
I can feel her pain...
It’s a good thing that she has been saving her and her brother
Soft Msp That's not her brother, it's a much younger boy that was on the boat with her. If his parents were with him, then they probably didn't make it alive so she takes care of him
Number 3 Please
You will get the creepy explanation from medeleine albright about 500k iraqi children get killed.
Awwh this Is sad :(
WHY COULD'T THAT FOSTER PARENT TAKE BOTH OF THEM D":
The first was uploaded in may 4 years ago the second was in may 2 years ago, so maybe they'll be a third by the end of this month?
It's her birthday today...
She has birthday on 16.3 and she was borned 2003

How did this war start?







"Meanwhile, on YouTube......2 years before......."
"*Splatoon sawks. Lawl.*"
All the conservative xenophobes in the US and UK need to watch this, perhaps they'll regret the Russia-funded Brexit and Trump victories.
THIS IS WHY I FRICKIN HATE THE WAR!!! THE POOR GIRL 😢😭😭😭😭
Jezz what happens next

It’s so sad I would love to help but I just can’t

i know that it happens almost every day and you who watch this video should be very lucky to have a home.. wifi.. electricity and other things that those people have.. like a family #STOPDOINGTHISSHITTOCOUNTRYS
what is this country :(
ok
Syria and parts of Iraq and now Libya too
This is why emotions should not be allowed in politics. Emotional decisions are generally poor and not based on facts. Should we take in refugees? Yes. Should we take all? No. As long as they have PROOF that they are from the country in crisis, they should be given asylum until peace is restored to the region. 

What you don't see in this video is that many of the 'refugees' are not even from Syria. They are from many areas of North Africa and all the way to Pakistan. They get onto boats and once they see the coast guard or a military ship they deliberately capsize the boat so they are rescued and taken into Europe. From there they are for the most part lost in the sheer number of people that need to be processed. They are then in our countries, doing god knows what. 

The influx of economic migrants from third world countries, with no connection to our own, will be the undoing of the West. It is our hubris that we are beyond reproach and our culture will never be replaced, that has led to our complacency. Our generation might not feel the full effects of our choices but our children and our children children will curse us for our choices. 

If you want to help the people of Syria. Go to Syria, grab a rifle and fight for the Assad regime, to help restore order to the imperfect but secular society he built.
is this real
this is so sad :((((
Basicamente asi esta Siria wn
Birth control? Less humans? Less sufferring?....
I was near to cry ;-;  I really want to help them.. but I can't I don't know how :((
Was there a war ?
Alexander Ong it's been going on for 7 years
Hope they make a movie
I don't understand this but it's sad, i guess so.
whats her real name?
This is so stupid and fake 😡 and plus Syria sucks too 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 make America great again👍🏻👍🏻😎😀m
Ofcourse it is necessary to use a WHITE and BLUE eyed westerner to defend the cruel act of importing millions of rapists and murderers into Europe. Disgusting way but again thats how the Soros and Redshields work, devils and satans
So emotional. 
While i sit here watching youtube all day in a peaceful country, in a peaceful nation. living n playing with friends all day long. 
Having enough rations for survival. Basically everything i need in life is here. no. I even have more stuffs than i think i have. 
But yet i still think i have nothing. #Feelsbadaboutmyself
Where did she go after England? France? I saw a French sign and it makes sense but I thought I heard German elsewhere
So....you want to save the children,alright then now what about the animals?why not save both...I would rather focus on the animal s because there more important.Each year a children gets saved and that’s enough,AND NO ONE IS FOCUSIN ON THE ANIMALS ITS NOT A JOKE THEY ARENT FOOD THERE AN AMAZING PART OF OUR LIFE
at least lets thank each other that we are still alive and lucky to be here  stuff is happening out there in the world and this is not joke people kids baby are dieing from hunger and thirst so least thank god for being as lucky to be here it werent for him we wouldent be here
My best friend went through this.She was forced to go places and nearly drowned,and no one was there to save her.One day someone adopted her.And we became friends.I think this is horrible and wish it would stop.
This is the first yt vid that actually made me cry cuz I juz love my mom so much idk wat I would do without her I can't even imagine me losing her
What country is this

Save the children of syria
I feel really bad for them
This made me cry. I can’t believe this is still happening and no one knows about it. Something has to change because children do not deserve to go through this pain, no matter what country they’re from.
this isnt happening. These are british kids.
Tbh everyone knows it. Most just dont care which is understandable.
I agree with you! I would start a peaceful protest or petition but I'm 12 years old so I don't have that powers but I can donate!
I deserve this others dont
This video is heartbreaking. And contrary to many comments here I don't know a single person in Europe opposed to the arrivals of children refugees. On the other hand I do know many people who refuse to welcome young male with a different culture and way of life. And I don't blame them considering the recents events and the increase of insecurity in Europe since 2014. People have to understand that refugees under 18 make up only 30% of the flow and many lie about their age to avoid deportation. Being concerned about the future of Europe is not intolerance, it's a legitimate reaction.
бедняжка
I feel bad that I can't make anything to help..😢
SO SAD!!!!!
0:29 DID HE SAY JAKE POUL?
What a grate game we gona make whit this.
Is this a British advert again? Oh my gosh..

This is just sick. We ought to be ashamed to call ourselves humans. Even snails have better morals than us sometimes.


There is still good in the world though,
Dont forget to say your aloha Akbars.
Why ? 😰

17 FUCKIN SECONDS INTO THE VIDEO AND IM ALREADY CRYING
Who started this crisis
0:29 in Newcastle were I live we have that angel called the angel of the north and it watches over the North East but why is it in this?
From the wars of stupid evil men, children suffer.
They aren't evil. Just stupid.
She is extremely lucky to still be alive.
This isn't real it is just to show you what it is like!
we need to make so many changes for everyone especially the children and trumpmis just sitting in the whitehouse planning on the great wall

0:30 he shouted Jake Paul
This was really powerful.
Goosebumps
Wow............
Is that real
?????????
8:29 sounds like somebody saying
JAKE PAUL!!!
I thought this was an ad wtf. But it’d be a pretty good ad.
humans are fucked up
I hate this.......the fact that it's real......the fact that families and people have to go through this.......
I cried so hard 😥😥my sis woke up but I told her it was too sad to shut up about
This makes me want to welcome every refugee child. Properly
Veery Laly I still don't see your data though
Veery Laly data
Tribute Films not every... we don’t need another Germany, Sweden or France.
Meshuggapethatonia As I imaged you have no proofs for your foolish theories, as I said you should not talk of things that you don't know about.
Veery Laly an economical refuge would not risk his life just for that. And it is distugasting what you are saying you clearly don't know of what you are talking about, it is easy to talk for a spoiled person like you.
THIS MAKE ME CRY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1:07 why are you wearing a hUFFLEPUFF ScAR f
Nossa que triste ""-"'
1:14 go bitch
it was a good idea to make the protagonist a white kid because otherwise people wont even give a second glance.
Goddam it it’s so sad
I'm freakin crying my eyes out. I would kms if that happened to me.
Yeet
I’m crying
I met this girl before, no joke
This is so sad😩
I feel feelings for once
I hope this makes a positive impact on our societies. Everyone is just so much into the war that they forget that we are humans. Nowadays also everyone is preparing for world war 3. I hope we'll get better than this.
IM
CRYING
Think of the conditions in the beginning of the first video. Now compare it to the end of this one. It's so sad to think that this happens in real life..
She be lookin like she wishes she was dead
Wow that was powerful. Ok back to CS:GO
Powerfull
i broke down crying when she said lily i know this is hard my nickname is lily so it hurt
😭
Anyone else find it slightly unsettling how one of the soldiers is caressing the girl's cheek while the people in the background are being pinned against the wall?
This is sad
This is so sad, the fact that this is happening now is just haertbreaking.
It is all lies, that video is a lie
Τότε θα μπορούσαμε να αναφέρουμε το Βιετνάμ

Some people are crazy

this made me cry
Every kid deserve a happy childhood see their future.
Why is war a thing? Can we replace the word war with peace? If you don’t want war then don’t fight.
It’s so sad that one day you’re with your family having anormal life.. and the next you’re whole family is gone and you’re in this girls situation...



I feel so bad😭
I still feel bad :(
:((((((
;(
I've seen this too many times and it still makes my heart hurt bad
Boi I cried when her phone wouldn't turn on, like, that was the only source of communication with her mother, imagine how terrifying that would be, you're in the middle of nowhere, and you literally have NO idea where your only family is left
;^;
I want to see a show... a show that shows how some kids survive through childhood through adulthood alone or something... but less sad... like no bombing stuff or gun stuff
I’m crying
I am crying.... Turkey wants a war with us Greece
Why am I crying I hope she finds her mom like the video for a happy ending
She is so strong! This message is powerful. Be grateful for the life you have. For the 
Lord has Blessed you.

to be honest this is like what happens with domestic violence ive experienced it and its horrible
Her birthday is 16th of may but they uploaded this at the 9th of may
NO more WAR
Poor girl
0:30 i thought someone screamed *JAKE PAUL!*
Are you related? "No... i mea-" ok i know this is a sad video but that part made me laugh really hard
I hope one day people change and turn war off
*INHALES* sniff im fine.... ;-;
This needs to change. Just cause of a handful of bad people all these good people who want a new life can't get one.
I feel like the world need to explode to end all the suffering but i dont know if that will make it worse
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I cried so much # save the children D:
The people who hated.. must have not cared.. what's going on in the world
*one year after trumps president*
D; ;-;
Save the children
Whoever made this is a genius
She reminds me of Ellie from The Last Of Us..
My feels thinking about it just makes me really sad  people these days are cruel that poor girl now I'm going to cry for a year
i remember watching the first part many many years ago, the girl in the video was only one year older than me. i didnt understand the world. So crazy seeing the second part to this video and growing up with this girl. (14 years old now)
what war is happening right now is there anywhere a war because the last time I checked the latest war was in 2011 but still, we need to prevent wars from happening ain't that right except revolutionary wars those should happen or maybe not who knows?.
Grebenar Cata It’s talking about the wars in the Middle East. It’s portraying a white girl instead of a middle eastern girl to show that just because is not happening to your children doesn’t mean it’s not happening at all. It’s raising awareness to the millions of children refugees trying to escape their home countries de to war and violence
This girl is so strong and it so sad video
I’m having trouble on what to comment because I might say the wrong thing. I feel completely bad for her and I really wanna help but I’m a 6th grader, I’m literally crying as I type this in because I’m doing stuff that is less important than what she and other people are going through and I’m sad and I wish I could help in anyway
Evangelia Smith the little girl is an actor and a famous one in Britain but this shits actually happening
I give mony to children that have no home and children in need MY NAME IS LILLIE
Deep
Not only save the children save the  parents and humans to!!! 😢😢😭😭😞😞Its so freaking sad😭😭
I find it disgusting how this Earth is so consumed with Money you need a Visa to get away from danger Visa’s are expensive and these selfish revolting humans are stopping other humans getting away from danger
At 0:29 it sounds like  some said  Jack Paul.
Are these actors? Or is this real? I know these events are actually happening, I just don’t think she took video and stopped a camera while having a gun pointed at her head..
🙂😕😮😯🙁😦😔😟😢😭
Is this real?
*Me enamore de ella ♥_♥*
Where is the time and place for this?
1 and 2 are very sad I'm crying my eyes out
Part three, please!
When Donald trump is world leader
I will be sure to start a campaign on this
let's all tweet this to trump. so he can see what he's about to do to the world, kids, families, and more.
....
Buy a gun.....
Is there a 3rd one because i wanna know if she finds her family again..😢😢😢😱
tomare algo de clorox
It is sad, sad, sad, how people are wolves to people, to refugees, just because they're of a different skin color or religion??? The refugees don't need enemies with "friends" like that. This is a sad age for humanity.
What a beautyfull short
stay strong <3
yo kudos to the cameraman
I want to donate money and let these kids live in my home so they can have a place to be safe😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
this happens all the time and we spend our time eating tide pods
My heart...it’s burning
Is this real, or scripted? Does one child actually go through all this? Where is she traveling?
England to america
I couldn't imagine going through that. I wish I could do more than sit in my home and donate
😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢
Part 3 :(
" Are you related?"

The only way to stop this is to win the fights in Syria, Iraq, Kurdistan, Lybia, and end the war. Otherwise this crisis will never stop.
This video made me sad and almost cry I hope the whole world watch this.

Oh my god.. did they recreate that news scene where some  reporter trips one of the fleeing refugee & got fired for it?
Honestly heart braking !

Megan Rose Grady
Part 2 okay where messyourself
Is this a skit because if not I wold worry so much pls reply
Yes, it is. But some people do suffer what you saw in the skit, so it's made to raise awareness about them.
My teacher always said: "Give them money, not for food but for a job. So they can make their own money."
The 1000 people that don't think these children should be saved are cold hearted. It's so sad and to see her loose her mum and half brother was heartbreaking.
"He's all I've got left..." that cut deep. Thank you for making this video.
She's the same age as me.
i cried
I cried when they took her brother away
Now they made a second part and made me cry more than before
It's so sad...I pray for the people that has happened to them..we are SO fortunate that this hasn't happened to us.....yet.I pray that they will be safe during their survival...this video touched my heart.1 like=1 respect and prayer.
This is our world now
0:37 and i will kill you.
Part 1&2 makes me almost cry bc of war
I also HATE war
 War is the worst,why can't people just gather along,be nice to each one and other this is why I hate war.
If I was the one adopting I would take both the boy and girl
Wtf happened? A revolution? Anarchy? A disease?
"are u related"
"no..-i mean"
had me laughing
Did this really happen while recording or is this an act?
0:36 woman:i will find you





me: and kill you ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
ha... ha... ha...
That's her mom.
angielaica fr? On a sad video? No.
Joey Grande Hriata k that’s not funny
and now she lost her mom and THAT got me
“I’m not going on the boat without you” those words made me burst into crying 😭 it is so sad she lost her family and the last person that said happy birthday
that poor girl just got her entire family taken from her

she did nothing
*The video should be called "This is what american troops do to the children of the world"*
Hm,Video never really made me feel anything..It was eh..i just felt neutral..Anyways i see that there is dangerous that could happen if ww3 arrives..so i guess ww3 is not a good idea
Lol, there is no single refugee in germany like her. They are young men. And they dont behave well. They have to go back and fight for their f**** country instead of pissing off and letting the family in the war zones.
;-; 😵😨😭😭😭
The poor girl her mom and her brother . Gone. And when the guy tried kidnapping her bro like NAH DONT TOUCH HIM!!!!!!!
I told my mom if this can happen she said it depends how people fight god damn thank god its not happening
The teddy bear that she got at the beginning I have in real life
My heart ;-;
I want another video. This is really truly amazing.
this is heart breaking
I cried.
Whats   your   Name     girl
Excuse me while I go cry my eyes out.
Thats so sad ;( i wosh her the best
Ela e muito bonita
this made me sob when her brother had to leave her and she said"he's all i have left"

0:30 JAKE PAUL!
"He's all I've got left"
AWE that's horrible

Who watched this like 100 times?
Cause I did
how can anyone thumbs down this
was the girl growing up if she did she looks the same from the beginning you know
We need to help
These are so sad.
The most important video that has ever existed. What a brilliant campaign. Such a disgusting shame that this is a reality.
the people who disliked this have no heart and they are just rude rude RUDE people
Sad that her mom left her alone
War......war never changes(Fallout introduction quote)
She’s such a good sister😭😭
That wasn't here brother
LMAO
that's what happens when the only relation that you are left with is your sibling,may this never happen to anyone ...
Is this real?
Im ten years old and im crying,this is amazing. It means alot
That was beautifully done!
Im not crying you are
I'm not crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 sorry
OH MY SWEET LORD. I PRAYED FOR 3 DAYS
Communist propaganda is absolutely 1st rate.
I think before the war and chaos,the children of Syria should of went somewhere safe like Ireland or somewhere in Europe.they could of did that just like in Narnia.
sadly,though, not every one is as generous and courteous accepting them as Narnians,this world is no fairy tale
This specific story is just be just staged....right? ;-;
visit middle east,just because it isn't happening where you live,doesn't mean mean it's not happening somewhere else
Jake Paul? 0:30
It breaks my heart that some children are forced to grow up in an environment like this
......this broke my heart this shows how sad war can end up lets pray that war will never happen again
Great videos, but just remember the masses of illegal migrants from areas that are fine using this as an excuse to come into Europe and leech off the people.
0:30 sounds like he said jake paul
Im right wing and against immigration but im not against welfare for all
Legit cried watching this
This is fake
This is not real , this is just commercials for awakening people's feelings. The war is not taking place in Europe. It is in Asia , Far East. But if , refugees come to Europe this video will be real.
Sad
The girl grew up a lot from the last video
So sad, but so cool!
0:25 sponsored by 28 weeks later.
This video doesn’t only show how horrible the life of Syrian children are. It shows how lucky we are to have basic necessities like food and clean water.
If I lost my parents I would not be as strong as here and not even cry
I HATE PUTIN!!! I HATE RUSSIA!!!! THEY'RE DESTROYING SYRIA!!!!!
SYRIA NEEDS AMERICA'S HELP!!!🇺🇲🇸🇾
0:29 anyone else hear “JAKE PAUL”? No? Just me? Ok..
That really weird feeling when your birth name is Lily But you like the name Alfie More...
Thats just me.. Ok.
Omg...these people they, they go through this all the time and it’s so so sad and scary. Being spectated from your parents at that age is so sad.
I’m all for children and family refugees. But single men refugees need to stay and fight. They’re men you’re supposed to fight for freedom.
So happy this is all fake
Is this the same girl from the last one
Now it's just finding out if this is an actual REAL video or just an act . I'm not saying it's a laughing matter there's just something in my gut that tells me not to trust this video.
0:30 I swear I heard someone yell "Jake Paul"
All I want to do is scoop all of these poor children up in my arms tell them I love them and everything will be okay.
I just realize something, 1:07 "pas d'anglais" .. so is it like a war between England and France? :/
It’s scary😭😔And now they don’t even have a mom😭😪😔🙏🏻
0:30 CHECKPOINT


Me:FACK OFF🖕🖕🖕
And what is the video also telling us ?
War never changes....
I wish all is peaceful and all love everyone no war jus be happy not like this this is tragically like if you touch on this video I hope the girl be ok :) stay strong like this if you touch
0:30 

The guy who screamed " CHECKPOINT! " made me laugh.. im a bad person..
You should make a  part 3, where Lily doesn't get adopted, and she escapes, but is forced to provide for herself, but she has no money, so Lily is homeless, and gets shot. Ending the video. I kinda feel bad for Lily.
She looks like my friend who I see all the time on a plane.
I mean DAMN! This is sad!!!!! It’s sad to see what people go through!!!!
i started crying
How does she survive
See, these are the type of videos people should be watching!
Respect❤️
Namaste, I just would like to take the oppurtunity to introduce a friends project he just started about Donate while travelling. He is travelling around the world and wants to fight for a change and bring people to smile with little attentions. He uses Instagramm and a Paypal link where ppl can donate through. With this money he buys food or something else and deliver it personally to these ppl in need. U will be tagged on a foto which proves this action.

Have u not ever wanted to donate but u were insecure that the money is really being used to help´? Well, with his project its bullet proof!

Find out more on his IG Account:

https://www.instagram.com/travelling.n.sharing/

All I ask u, is just to have a look into his introduction and then its up to u. (No Scum etc)

Thank u very much. Lets be the change!
This could be a great movie or show
Yay part 2 but still sad :'(
This made me cry so much I couldn't breath..
I just want a movie about this... or part 3
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I wonder what’s happening to Lily now...
1:27
That was the most heartbreaking part of the whole series
When she look at the camera when the video end I feel like why why why God do this to people we are praying but you are not doing any think God please save your child well I'm a child😅😅😅😅😅😶
When is their part 3?
Thanks for making this vids I really cried please tell me her that I really  like her

It's going to happen if we won't defeat ISIS.
;(
man i cried that was even sadder than the first
wow isis is gonna  kill everyone  I hope is not isis
Dam isis
Bless.
where's her mother?
I think about this everyday. I went through the fear of not knowing if I was going to get sent back to my country, if I did I'd have my education ripped from me and I would have had no other choice then to marry before the age of 25, probably would have got married at 18 because of no education but I probably would have refused till the age of 20. Then I would have had no other choice. Oh my god that's terrifying.
This is why Syrians should learn from the west , you can disagree with the government and say what you like if it is not violence to another or fire
Al Asad is the lesser of two evils
AidenExists lol I really hope you're joking. That's extra offensive.
OH NO NOT GETTING MARRIED BEFORE YOUR 50 YRS OLD! (sarcasm) seriously, young adults now act like babies...
Yea, I am lucky to not have experienced this where I live but I still mourn over those who go through it and can only imagine the true problem at hand.
This world is so depressing
Ha...funny
and I thought that i saw the worst of it...
I laughed so hard all the time 
That video sucks
This is sad 😞
Poor lily, people are too stupid to stop war and make up
Nice video i laughed all the time.
(PS. That video sucks (:
I saw the first one. This is Call of Duty Black ops 3
Omg this is so sad 😭
I wanna be the very best and catch'em all but whole city is burnig
I cried
WHERES THE 2017 ONE??? I NEED THE NEXT PART OF THIS VIDEO!!!
@Ren_the_person_thing your great grandfather contributed to society and is a benefit to society , most children fleeing from syria cough cough 20 year olds are unemployed create ghettos of the original culture  , they don't benefit to society , if refugees are able to conform with western values and have work skills they are allowed to live here and get a citizenship
@Mikasa Ackerman That's messed up. Everyone should have a chance at a new life. Especially after traumatic events. I had a great grandfather who escaped a concentration camp after several tries, and although when the war ended he was traumatized, aged quickly (he was young, but looked and behaved like an old guy due to trauma), and poor. Yet, he took refuge in America and his once small grocery cart turned into a multi-million dollar produce company after his sons took over. You may think these people are useless, but everyone should be allowed to start fresh and EVERYONE has *something* to contribute.
@Marduk most of the refugees are in there twenties and don't benefit to society , the children and old people are more likely to die on the journey
Mikasa Ackerman what is wrong with you
I AM A REFUGEE . I came from Kenya when I was 5 months old
I cried in the middle of the video
I want to hug her very much now :'/
So sad I wish this wasn't a reality of life
I wasn't shocked. I'm cold blooded, sry.
The Friendly Narwhal I don’t think this was over dramatic it was showing what could happen if people don’t get common sense and end these wars its teaching people a lesson nothing in this is over dramatic at all but then again it is your state of opinion not mine I’m just giving my opinion back so please don’t take this as anything rude :)
hi5
The Friendly Narwhal  how was it overdramatic?????
ask my about it i will till you that all of that is true ....


and i wish it was't true
Nick Chase rally I'm crying

The people who disliked this video has no soul
Maybe I don't have one
Stephany Granados OMG I JUST NOTICED THAT WTF
Stephany Granados they disliked it because they hate what’s going on over there.🤷🏼‍♀️
This video really make me want to work with UN or Unicef to save these poor people ,and I will do everything that I can do to save these people ,action is louder than word

The Earth is getting ruined.


Animals are being tortured - for fun and for their value.

The earth is getting polluted - by us humans who don't care for the environment.

War happens - because of stupid fights between countries' governments.


Stop torturing animals- imagine animals torturing you, and you'd know how they feel.


Stop polluting the earth- we have no other place to live.

Stop war - war is useless - why create wars and harm other innocent people just because you have different thinking, want to control some land or something? 


IS MONEY SO FKING IMPORTANT?!

THE HUMAN RACE IS SINFUL


TOO SINFUL
Because you are human, human beings have never stopped fighting in tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years, unless all human beings have evolved into gods, or never stop the war, but also for human and war is symbiotic, war is the most intense way of human communication, he will promote social change, he will promote human progress, you can Looking at history, mankind has not declined in countless wars, but has become more vigorous and more advanced, because if mankind slows down, it will lose the momentum of progress, and the fierce resistance and collision to make human courage forward.
We have mars to live in
Elvis Isn't Dead Laws against animal cruelty isnt gonna stop them from being killed for food.

This is the near future this is possible this might happen because all the things that are happening right now.
1 and 2 made me cry... I feel so bad right now!!! 😭
I feel so sorry.. ;( people are just rude to countries ;c
It's sad to think that this happens everyday to children in syria.
This is still fake
WOW 😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢
She reminds me of clementine
uuhh if there was war in britain there would be war all over the world so this is kind of world war 2 which u cant really use as comparison to syria and stuff but w/e
So this is... all fake??? It's so realistic
Our brave leader smiles at this.

WEELS SAD .-.
#save them!
0:31 I thought he said JAKE PAUL
What’s happening at 0:22 ?
nice EU propaganda.
This should be made into a movie
I'm pretty sure ur right man
Ashley G IT SHOULD but then I would cry
Ashley G yes
Watch Children of Men
Children of Men is pretty similar
Everybody that dislikes this video has no heart
So these refugees come to this country and immediately get free housing. But people who are homeless and have been on the streets for years don't?
Nonononononono refugees are bad, how about we send our militaries to the war zones to help the people and rebuild the country
Omg I can’t right now
Its happening in other countries,., lots of refugees got nothing but their god.. and i think American government did mostly of thier suffering.,
This would make a great movie
so glad we evolved beyond this in the west, let's not import it back....
Omg I almost always cry I when I see this...
Why this kid its not fair

and this has given me ideas the first and second one
Thank You.
Could not stop crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😔😔😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😞😞😭😭😭😭😔😔😞😞😔😞😔😔😞😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
If this is a movie, what is it Called ?
This is such an emotional video people need to spread awareness this should be made into a movie
do any of the royal family donate to charities,? if the queen stopped getting her shoes hand made for 1yr that would be about £15,000 surely she could buy clarks shoes for a change it's not like her feet would get bunions, if she done this no one would notice she was wearing shoes that common people wear if she gave up her made to measure dresses,coats &hats also she alone could pay for wells to be fitted in 3rd world countries then at least they would have fresh water or does she think her feet & clothing  more important than kids & families lives, i don't think 1 person would say oh she's wearing that same outfit again, give us a break the royals are an ugly lot so clothes no matter the price wont make them good looking , they could dress in primark & look the same as usual , I HOPE THE ROYALS HAVE A THINK ABOUT THIS BEFORE THEY LOSS THE RIGHT TO SIT ON THE BRITISH THROWN THEM BEING OF GERMAN DESCENT, WE QUITE SIMPLY DON'T NEED THEM RULING OUR COUNTRY FOR US WE CAN&WILL DO A BETTER JOB OURSELVES
This almost made me emotional...

Bobgamertv Fix'd.
Bobgamertv Welp changed
Its child refugees
It's funny because they're pretending like Syrian refugees. aren't mostly pedophilic old men.
Is this real?
As the girl is called
Are things like this still really happening?
WutThe Unicorn yeah. It might happen pretty soon with this bullshit going on with Kim Jong un and Trump.
This is so sad
😭
Is it istrael?
I would 100% be fine with syrian refugees if they stopped bloody stabbing people and committing so much crime and turning europe into a 3rd world landfill
Everyday this happen this happen to my cousin donate money to stop this
@dragon thao I hope one day you understand what that boy/girl has gone through one day
dragon thao I hope you die
Locked Forever money won't stop this. You have to join the fight.
Base game gamer if anything you should've said heart
Powerful
Also if you are making jokes about this thats sick
War is terrible and evil it takes the lives of so many innocent people this video brought me to tears no one especially a child should have to go through this
That's ww2 D:
Lily:"He's all I got left" me: *Burst into tears* MAKE ANOTHER ONE PLEASE!! :-(
Emely Tv  wow... Just wow.
I am sry to say..... 
Comments like this make me laugh
This kid unkillable salute to maker of this vid!
brought me to tears
0:08 what the hell is that guys give me a guesse
1:02 ...the heart beat monitor stopped...
They took his bro away i about to cry T-T
I wish it wasn't fake, not that i want a real person to suffer like that but... you know
Kaitlyn Weisel well that would make it realistic but this is supposed to show the entire process and during war people don’t usually record the full problem.
Daddy i wouldve liked  to see the real photos/videos that a real victim of this tragedy had taken instead of this being directed and acted, did i help?
Kaitlyn Weisel no I don't know actually, can you explain?
Wait is this real cause if it is...





It's kinda bad to cause people are killed while this video is filmed to be on YouTube...
It is a commerical to raise awarness of refugee children.
(And because many people would be like: "It's a syrian/iraq/... child" and wouldn't care, they put this whole thing into a fictional scenario where there is war in britain)
this is so sad. i wish I could do something about it
This is so sad, Alexa, play Horst Wessel Lied
nackimation ..how though?
Chris Martinez kinda
lupita paz you could if you were a American soldier
I feel bad for all btw what place is that
gee this is dark

FBI open up....
@life lessons calling a child beautigul isn't pedophilia. Also if the guy is under 18 then it also isn't pedophilia. He may also be a teen.
FBI! Open up!

Was this a war in Chernobyl?
Why Elijah Wood looks like a girl in this video?
i swear he says jake paulers at 0:29
When she said “I’m not getting on the boat without you” I thought of titanic
Its the same girl! Nice to see her again-
It's so sad. It's not funny to laugh at. It almost made me cry. Getting spread or died from everyone you know. Losing everything you have. I think everyone should see this and think about this for a moment, think what can you do about this. Because all of those people are stuck in a war. Who else cryed or sad.
I cried watching this 😪
She was holding her toy bunny that she got for her last birthday 😢😭
Made me cry
I KNOW YOUR TRYING TO HELP BUT STOP MAKING US FEEL SAD LIKE WHAT THE HECK WHY IT'S HAPPENING NOW IF YOUR READING THIS JUST HAVE A GOOD LIFE OKAY THAT'S ALL WHAT MATTERS OKAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think it's true story
Who tf disliked this
This would make a great movie
Well that was a ride
Eh, at least it's all fake
Love how you all worked hard for this though
Bad joke too :/
Some people are mean they joke about this and they joke about people cutting wristz
thanks all of Westerners,you guys make this world like this,now you tell me to save the children, one day all of you will pay for it,let's see
This shook me 😭
This video is what happened when the ww3 start
It could be happening right now ... It us happening right now ... People might even die in 3 2 1 in a snap of a finger someone might have died from the other side
her bunny stays.
Is is true
This is the darkness in the world.
Is this about world war 11? Like Is she a jew? This is just sad.
it just so sad
1000 PEOPLE DISLIKED THIS!!!! HEARTLESS MOTHERF**KERS
They should make a move of this
Save the children and the animals
Shes the Clemintine of our century
What is her name
0:30 JAKE PAUL!
this girl looks like ginny from harry potter
0:29 JAKE PUAL!
This Video was posted on my birthday! Wtf! 😥😥😣😣(9th May)
This should not be happening to children and when people say they are scum it makes me sick, we made this problem by fighting in their wars
this is wrong she should of just gone to frome mate
1:15 sometimes you need to cuss
It gets me everytime at 1:03 when she goes "Mum please" while crying
It nauseates me how the media wants to enforce us into their own empathetic beliefs with these non-essential advertisements - let one's perspective be and stop calling us "monsters" because our viewpoints differ from yours. It isn't our ignorance that needs to be educated; it's the fact that we have different standpoints from you sensitive milksops.
We have a dearth of concern for such people & choose not to invest in their troubles; we do not revel in their misery nor desire for them to die.
The most shocking is the grammar in the title
Her birthday was the same as mine
А кто её снимал?
That vidéo made me give coin to all countrys
I REALLY HOPE THIS IS STAGED THIS IS HORRIBLE
Is thet true
Make a realistic one...
This comment by posted by no one from there and someone who clearly knows no one going through that. Go ahead: name the first names of those you know personally going through this. If no one, you really have no room to speak about reality: you can't handle it, can you?
This is realistic, that is the entire point of this video, they are showing what is happening for the survivors, they are trying to stop this by showing you the suffering they go through everyday, and if you want a really realistic one then all we would see was blood and worse.
When the mom went missing i cried
yt watcher I'm a man but I was crying on the inside
OMG! I fell so bad
My god i was on my back home from liver pool. Minf you im from Illinois and this was playing on a tv station at the airport. My god did this scare me.
i dont understand the point
CHECKPOINT
I really want to hug that girl right now...
The war in England needs to stop people are dieing
Phileggtree dude its ww2 America took it back from the nazis
0:36 And I will kill you
its just to sad
i thought it was sweet that the girl took care of the little boy
:(
This bout to happen with America
It has already happened, but with refugees from the war-torn countries in the middle east.
Dingfro 😭😭😢😢😢😲🤤😱😱😱😱😱
Nope because 80% of America have firearms and 90% are patriotic and 50% are ready to fight and die for there country
those poor children who had to go through that true sadness i wanted to cry the people who started the war dont have a heart
I got shown this in drama
I thought it was disgusting when they took the boy from the child. Just the scene when she made the mistake of saying there not related made everything worse for me. And it wasn't even her mistake, sure there not related but there close and you can't do that to people. It was her mistake but it was disgusting when they acted on it. Sad video
As well made as this was, i'm afraid immigration isn't as simple as asking for it.
Now these kids are dying because the idiot that we call our president turned his back on them
At 0:29 it sounds like someone yells Jake Paul
*sniffs* this is so sad
...
How did they film this won't the bom hit the camera
What I think they did is get a waist holder with a type of selfie stick with a go pro because of the water scene
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 whyyyyyyyyyy whyyyy





No, im serious im not joking
Where is family I no see
He want shoot the girl
Who is this actriss? She is SOOOO BEAUTIFUL
00:30 ghost why are you here I thought your dead                 Only call of duty people understand
Omg
Reminds me of Grave of The Fireflies.
0:30 jake poul?
Were umm the children was lost with his brother?
This is why sometimes I am disgusted to be a human
The fact that our ancestors had started war that isn't needed, risking innocent lives. #maketheworldbetter
This is like my life getting bombed but good 9 billion survived my family also survived
This made me cry and I was shocked at this video
its a really sad thing that we need to use a western country as an example because otherwise people just would ignore it keep up the good work guys
Ole Bras De Ruiter well
David Roberts I really don’t get your point, would you care to elaborate?
Your comment shows your complete ignorance on the matter; using a "western country" is the Whole point. Do you think it would be better to bring the matter to the attention of the people of Syria? Please, _attempt_ to think, before posting such idiocy.
Why is the world so cruel...
ANOTHER ONE
They flooded to Holland so sad :(
"Are you related?" "No-- I mean" I lost it
She goes from living in suburban luxury to being a desperate refugee? What about all those British children living in disgusting council flat blocks, who faced crime, alcoholism, and drugs every day?
Im gowing to cry so sad 😭😭😭😭😢😭😢😭
I nearly cried
Down with war. Down with greed.



Down with the people who disliked this.
The funny part about this is that 90% of refugees are adults
She should've said she was related to Alfie.....
She's the same age as me man
When something taste soooo good
Theese videos help me become cold hearted I must be i need to ignore this cruel world. I. Already poor I can't help these people I cant even help myself. I feel bad for all these kids and moms but I don't want to see it I can't change their situation s flight to America is 15 k and in some countries u get paid 1$ a day . 1$x365 days of work=365$ without food. 50 years of working without getting food or anything else.
Who else cried watching this? 😭😥😭
Little Clem.
For my birthday I'm buying a shot gun because of this
The thing that makes me sad is that i just saw a comment on here saying "im from iraq and that happens every day help" and it got so much hate like if u have something bad to say dont say it at all cause you probaly made that person feel even worse like what has the world come to were all people were all the same i dont understand why everyone is hateing on one an other god or who ever u guys believe in brought us here for a reason and that reason isnt to hate but its to share the love and laughter all together and to be happy i dont know why the world has come to this like it really is sad and im not saying all people are like this some people are actually great happy helpful respectfull and ect but its just really sad to see all these racist comments. 😢
Oh my gosh this just cut right into my heart.
Befor the window broke it sounded like he said JAKE PAUL
Who is she I need to know
Omg I'm so sad
Yea something bad is going on to my life my fam my house this is relatable
What got to me is when she was supposed to make a wish but then she looked at up at us
Non vi crede più nessuno
How could they dare to take her little brother. Its HER family and now she's all alone.
Did she say go bich
I herd jake paul
This what happens when ww3 starts
WHY CAMT THIS DAMN EARTH BE AT PEACE BECAUSE OF people lose their familys
Make a third one please
Why do they not fight back? Fight for your country and fellow citizens.
She so cute
I wanna she
Please.
Give she to me
She looks little bit like Ally from Collage Humor
Earth is big enough for all of us ! STOP FIGHTING ! WE ARE HUMAN NOT ANIMAL ! GREETINGS FROM AZERBAIJAN
We need a pt 2
This is part 2
74 days
Why is this so Sad she went through much trouble is she a refugee or something I have learnt alot about Refugees
Omg this made me cry! 😖😢😖😢😖😢
Omg the reason why I'm sad about this is that a lot Of kids actually go through this every day. 😭😭😭😭😭
Poor people she lost every thing including her father and mother and only have little brother left
why would they take the only person she considered family?
I wish I was her and she was me because I live some were no one can hunt any one in a nice place I'm not 5alking about being a hipy
I WANNA MEET THAT ACTRESS!!

Such talent...
This is more like a zombie movie than a war educational film it's like who are they fighting
We live in a sick and perverted world, where only God can save us. 1 like = 1 prayer for God to save us all
Save me God, my nigga
Endo geny omg NO! I mean, I want to pray to save us all BUT LIKING IT WON’T HELL ANYTHING!
+Endo geny you're sick for misusing God's name, im sorry but you're just disrespecting our religion, likes has nothing to do with God, so disappointing, "why are people cruel against God" ask that yourself, you're a good example of that statement right now...
+dragon thao wut?
+Lance Deserves His Earth yeah, misusing God's name for attention, that's messed up
Oof
Why would she go from being cared for in a hospital to being expected to trek from France to Germany?
She should've just said yes!!! 😭😭😭 People are sick these days and war shouldn't be allowed anymore
the first one was already sad why did you have to make a part 2 D:
Still beats School by a long shot.
My friend went through this ;-; i cried
I didn't even know there was a second day. Really powerful stuff and sends a strong message.
I'm just glad we have a government so well organised so well backed and so well armed this will never happen in this country
It's so sad
ANGEL OF THE NORTH
Shoot.... There is still war going on today we are lucky we get to survive
Is this what refuges go through?
Is this fake?
10000 subs yes.
1:44 if war is happening I would be dead by now
This really went to the feelings. Tears just started pouring down my face... I hate how people joke about this. The part when she lost her brother and said "Hes all I have" I felt so grateful to have my little brother still with me today..
😭
At 0:30 it sounds like someone is saying Jake Paul!
How do they take the video
After all all of happend they still have high  quality camera
Omg 😞
Into the deep dark fantasy
0: 20 😵😐😲🖕
Wow!! When she stranded on an beach a dutch person helped her but Holland and England are neighbors so didn't knew they made this so realistic! Srry for the bad English im Dutch.
So sad 😭😢😭
This is ww3 but not in American
😶😣😢😢😢😢😢
I'm in  tears this how sad it is
I don't get this?
Helen Simpson If you dont, you are too young to be using the Internet or you live under a rock.
1:07 it's France ?
0:21 pedophile?
WHY DO I MAKE MYSELF WATCH THESE THINGS LIKE IF YOU AGREE 😭😭
*pulls out gun*SHOOT THEM ALL NO SURVIVORS FOR ISISz!

Damn, that's fckn sad..
This is a good video to show people what is haping aroud the country and sad that she can't find her mum  u should love each over  think if that pessiton
This is sad
😢😢😢😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
#FUCKIDIOTSTUPIEDISISIDIOTS
Poor girl I feel like this  is in Cleveland a bunch of things happen there the are living in In a dangerous  place #savechildreninthewar
This needs to be a movie
The sad truth is some of the people she was with went to strap a Bomb to their chest and blow up an Ariana grande concert
KILL CHILDREN
When she was on the subway or bus did someone say "JACKPOT" 🤔 it's not time for jackpot THERE A FLIPPIN WAR OR SOMETHING
I love this so much, I understand how people are getting mad about other people joking about these situations but think for a second. Those people weren't fully aware of how this actually is. The Bliss of ignorance makes them seem rude but it's not completely their faults, unless they know completely well and then their just d*cks but you never know which is which. I have an odd wish of my life. To have every horrible thing happen to me... So I can relate to people who need help and so they can have a friend to talk to to understand...
This could be made into a series
Made me cry too😭😭😭
God dam it people who cause stuff like this don't deserve to be considered human for they are nothing but scum
Don't feel bad for that girl. She got paid hundreds if not thousands for being in this video, kek
This new call of duty movie looks great
Now is not the time for jokes >:(
I LOVE SPONGEBOB Glasses it was a joke
DUDE U F*&%ING MONSTER
That’s so mean! 
Imagine yourself like that no family.
Devin Luhman lol
Is this like the life of a refugee?
im shook
btw
How was this video taken?
Wait nvm
Whats the name of the girl in the video?
The Syrians lived better than half the countries of the world They do not want Europe They came to it only in order to live in peace and when the war ends in Syria they will return , Syria better than your country and its people University certificate they have accepted in 96 countries I'm form turkey by the way sorry for my bad English..
Shasho Tv Poor Syrian
Its all just dirt and sand we all live on the same planet we should be able to live with one another in peace no where is better to anyone than home
+Shasho Tv The before and after pictures are shocking. If the city was still intact, I would've loved to visit it.
Shasho Tv What about those Pakistani and Afghan guys that we can't schoo out of our country?
It was a nice country but it was never better than any European country
Nazi losers are apparently taking these videos and editing them to include white supremacist, anti-refugee messages.
I'm so sad.. she lost her dad, her mom, now her brother who wasn't even related to her.. she lost everything... they are right.. it's not happening here, but doesn't mean it will happen..
I may not be her but I still feel terrible of what's she's been through..
1k of people ( who disliked this ) are dickheads
This made me cry
Build the wall.
This is what's coming to Europe
Doctor Coconut NOOOOOO I'M GONNA DIE
You mean Eurasia
Um what?
Chris Martinez not yet, we still have a couple decades before we need to employ drastic measures such as mass genocide
I sent the first one to my dad because he was in a war and thinks everyone who is from foreign country's are bad people. Someone show this to Trump.
is this fake?
if I was kita from deathnote I would kill every member of ISIS
awww:3
It is starting to happen hire
so sad,😢
OMG this is devastating THIS LITTLE GIRL AND LITTLE BOY tried to survive please like to spread hope
this is so sad
I'm sorry but what's a refugee?
I'm sorry but what's a refugee?
0:30 Jake Paul I hate to make a joke about this , but she was getting attacked EVERYDAY BRO
it says Cheekpoint but i thought it said jake paul
Right now I will forgive you for making a joke but why does his damn name have to be brung up in EVERY video I watch, totally unrelated and at first it was funny that just damn annoying. Also it is not just you, someone will find a way to bring him up, someway somehow, it’s like a damn talent!
Disclaimer : I honestly feel terrible about the joke , but if you know me you know that I'm a horrible person
well I watch the full video of this
We think we understand these people, but we don't, we all have a little greed and carelessness inside us and those children have been 
Put through hell. We won't really understand until we've been put through it ourselves.
this makes me think of Peter Pan idk why
This happens to kids.
why the hell im I watching sad VIDEOS at 1:30 AM
She takes really good care of her brother that's more important
Optimist Prime oh then it still counts of her brother
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE
What happened to the girls mom
I wish this never happens it's sad hard I cried
1:15 
"I'm not hungry"
*cries a frikin river*
Right after I watched this I started crying like crazy
"He's all I've got" *Hugs teddy bear*
they need to turn this into a full length movie of just these one second clips. I would definitely watch it. Also it would open a lot of eyes to the problem
This is SOOO sad!!
Were Is this happening?
This is really sad a girl lost her mom, I would just end it there:(
Traitors will be hunted when this eventually starts.
bush did 9/11, bomb the middle west
I want war to stop. I want this to stop. I hate it when children can get hurt in something. Yes this happens all around. But children shouldn't have to get into this. It's the people who create the war who should deal with it.  But they shouldn't create enemies either so no one should be at war.
Funnily, this is what the future will look like for white people if we keep accepting all these migrants, who unlike this video wants us to think are mostly grown men.
omg she treat him like her own little brother
omg she took care of the boy
I really want to meet the girl
This is very sad I feel bad for her💔😢 and click newest first and there's a ton of haters and people joking about this😢
So, they are British refugees in Britain? I don't get it, sorry.
is she the girl in Logan becuz she looks so alike herr
I'M SOO SAD I ALMOST CRIED
Well everything is nice but almost never refugees looks like that. Healthy strong black man don't look like poor European girl speaking English!
0:30 SHAY POLEY wtf oh wait there was capituons it's said checkpoint
the moment the soldior tauching her is soooo disturbing
Remindes of Clem from The Walking Dead
😭😭❤❤
Её мама наверное сума сошла, когда не смогла ей дозвониться ((( Сердце разрывается, так грустно...😭💔
Her life Just fell apart, once it was perfect the last second she is homeless with no family
Europe's future.
What is this about
real nice an all that propaganda. Really jerks my tear glands but there's one problem. Ultimately, I don't care about people living across the world. The only people I am concerned about is immediate family and my fellow Americans. IF I have the time and resources to FEEL like caring, then I will but for now I have neither the time or the inclination to feel pity for people I have never met in my life.
this is what's happened in syria and other countries
besteira
I saw the video with a song called "Bombs On Monday Mornig" by Melanie Martinez and it made it even SADDER
16th May
That is my sisters birthday
This is shocking
Why does this happen
0:29 i live about 20 minutes away from that.
its sad i cry a lot even now i am full of tears
still fake
At 0:21 I don't understand what was that man doing to the girl that made the mother mad?
Is this real? Like this is acting right?
Omg when he touched her face the first time that came to my mind... DO.NOT.FUCKIN.TOUCH.HER YOU SON OF A BITCH
I'm so so so so sad right 😭😭😭
that place is a very bad/dangerous place for children find another country that is safe for children like The United States of America or Canada (if America or the usa try Canada)
When it got to the end
"He's all I've got left.." I started to cry ;c
and the worts of all is that the goverment dosn't even care
I birth the 6 may 2002
This is like a civil war, but in Britain.
Worst part is Trump doesn't care
america should watch this and stop banning refugees.
"He's all I got left."
NOOOOOO 💔💔💔💔💔💔
CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHAF HAPPENED AT 0:31 
also who’s watching in 2017
0:13
1:16
ded
Bad yet really bad joke
Huh?
Sarah Mao eh?
trump needs to see this
Oh be quiet
terrible!  that why I support TRUMP  he supports and will build a safe    neighborhood/ area in this innocent little girl country  protected by troops so these families are not split up .
but trump created it :/
*EVERYONE*
Why this girl reminds me of Clementine so much?!?!?!?!?!
this is our world
How do I save refugees
well.... war is something we created by our self can totally avoid it, not sure why it's happening.    some people are just idiot want to be king.
Propaganda! 😑
i dident know there were war in britan
I've watched two of these and I can't watch another I struggled though the first one
"I'm not hungry" aw
just finished watching the one of the other girl
*why would you dislike this*
Como se llama la chica
Someday this will come ;-;
33k missed the dislike button
How old is she
is this real
wait a minute! 0:10 it says "dad and husband" are they just saying the dad is the husband of the mom or the little girl is engaged or something!?
WHY IS IT ALWAYS HER BIRTHDAY
Is she Syrian or British
The NWO is enemy of every independent nation and religion or culture. They believe not in diversity but in the gray consumer global society. No need to accept it..
i cried.
I don't honestly know wtf is going on
I never cry at videos, this one got me hard :'(
Gosh she's British of course she washed up on the Dutch shore omg I broke for a second I heard my language and my heart just stopped.......
Yeah I want to see a movie of this I've been looking for the full thing of this
I can't believe she lost her mother.....
I thought the first video was a zombie apacolypse... Sorry, I'm so stupid.
my polacy też jesteśmy na to  narażeni ponieważ przyjechało do nas aż ponad 100 uchodźców więc musimy uważać ponieważ mogą nam zrobić coś swojego i zniszczyć nasz kraj
This, shocks me... make's me feel all kind of emotions. Angry, sad, scared, depressed. It realy touches me deep. No child in the world deserve's such suffering.
The fucked thing is we shouldn't be caring about the refugees, we should fix their countries so stuff like this doesn't happen
She was born in 2003 so young.. it's sad she went through this
she looks like ginny weasley
I am actually crying...
I CAN'T STOP CRYING HELP.
Oh my god....I'm crying my eyes out right now..... it's a sad time now with all the attacks going on and stuff..... may i just say this girl is a good actor, nice affects..... but really sad.... 😢😢😢😢
who's this girl
"1000 dislikes"
there are 1000 heartless people here
She is beautiful
Hi
Мм
Leonie Magauer ikr
Is this a real video or actors
This video has really changed me, even when we think we have a hard life we don't realize that there other people suffering more. Like what this video shows. I really broke down when she said, "he's all I got..." I will never look down at how "bad" my life is again.
This broke my heart💔💔💔💔💔
Please please please make a movie that way it can spread and warn people about what's happening right now and how they can help
😭😭😭😭😭😖😖😖
i cant lie i cryed like if you did to
I'M BALLING MY EYES OUT 😭😭😭😭 the saddest part was when she was seperated from her mother and then seperated from a little boy who she treated like her little brother and the only thing and person she's got left :(
too clear cut to not be staged.
wer hier einen witz wie 

"schwarzer humor ist wie ein flüchtlingsboot.



kommt nich immer gut an"
darf es überall.
I disliked.......I'm sorry....I hate seeing people in pain.
that is horribly sad.
Wait,whos hurting Syria?
This made me not breath...
no... no it's not happening today and not here
0:39 "...and I will kill you". Sorry, somebody had to lighten the mood.
1:16 they were in Germany
The thing is, yknow all the story books that always end with a happy ending? And then you come back to reality. Reality. Full of humanity that has become too much. Bullies, people committing, wars ect. 
Life sucks. Reality sucks. 
There's never going to be peace. Never be actual true peace. What has humanity actually become?
At the start she is reading more than this by Patrick ness and it is a really great book
0:11: MISSING DAD AND HUSBAND is on the paper. I'm confused. Does the girl have a missing dad and husband, or is the husband referring to her mom?
The thing is my father worked at the borders all he sas was adult syrian men wanting to cross the border not women and children so all I can say that this is really sad :(
This whole thing makes me angry. We need to save the people in this country. This is real. It's terrible.
We're does this take place?? England?
This is so sad but it gives an amazingly strong message.
0:30 CHECKPOINT!
cod mw4 confirmed
TheDoctor 1120 it is
aleoj1976 oh shut it
BounceDragon boohoo
Christoman64 the check point probably was captured by the Smilitary in attempts to capture people fleeing the country atleast that's what makes sense to me
How did this get filmed? Is this fake?
literally crying when she said "he's all i've got". reminded me of when me and my brother got seperated into different foster homes.
I was devastated when the mom went 😭 My eyes weren't holding on 😔
I disliked this video.
If this was a music video they should make the song Better Days - Victoria Monet & Ariana Grande
I live where that video took place and I have the same name as her.. uhm..
damn they are good at these. almost made me feel something
then she became x23 from logan
wait... the robbers stood there for a day?
I dare someone to say refugees aren't welcome one more goddamn time and I'll murder someone
This is what refugees go through. This is what they face , the very same things like in the video. We should allow them safe haven in our countries
Lol
Didn't know brexit was this bad...
This made me cry so much. More people need to see this so they know what is happening.
that's so sad
I don't care about this topic. I'm just gonna stay at home, watching the world burn.
Oh my God.. I wasn't thinking that it can be so hard.. i'm crying.. I know that would be probably happend all  of us in any time..
i'm holding back tears... this video it so powerful...
...AND still the most clickbait and bullshit propaganda video to this day.
😭😭😭😭😭fuck this world😭😭😭😭😭 its just a litle girl want to life like other kids😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
D.M.A aljbore oh yeah we'll try to be a soldier during ww2 eh will you be using emojis now
1:01 have you tried to put it on rice?
Ik it's a tad irrelevant, but these actors are amazing.
Sure, someone stood there to film these rather than being productive... fake
FAKE STILL
Ww3 and still records for sc
its feminism
VIVA LA REVOLUCION
The funniest thing is, that she's going to germany. Even with a 'refugees welcome' sign on the wall. That's so realistic!
I'm in tears
I feel Sorry for her she lost her family she have to look after her brother
I love your video
This video is so powerful im holding back tears
If you would stay in the EU you could escape war and enter the other countries without being illegal immigrants
When the girl said "He's all I got" I started crying because like that was his son to her or little brother 🤧😭
STOP THE WARS !!!!!
I'm scared
i want this to happen but it probably never will basically all the countrys of the world form an alliance just for one to fight isis
am I a monster for not crying am I a monster for laughing when people get scared am I a monster for punching people am I a monster for laughing at everything am I a monster for not having any emotion to this am I a monster for not caring about these people but only myself
I'm crying 😣
Its uploaded on my b day 😫😫😫
"He's all I got" I stopped watching it.
i was on the floor crying
Laura Kinney... You've made it to Canada
I CRIED SO BAD
The moment where she asks "I hope you made a wish" and then the girl looks at us hit me hard. It just shows how little we are doing about it. And seeing the Angel Of The North getting burned to pieces, portraying the thought of 'this could be us' makes for some get the idea better. 

Sad.
Her name is Lily...




My name is Lily..
Oh em gee me matthyou woah somewan elsa mathu to woah
Broken -Buns Their just making a connection to the character by name
Yes same

Mostly feel bad for her mum......
As soon as she said "he's all I've got" I started crying.
Who dislike the video is evil
POOR GIRL! SHE HAS TO LOSE HER FRIEND! WHY!!!! 😫😞😭😭😭😭😭😭
PERVERT
WTH is the guy rubbing his fingers on her cheeks
too deep
This is sad
This is so good for "try not to cry" video
68th of May????? do you even English
it's the make a wish. that's what gets me right where I live
I mean yeah not real hopefully but beautiful.
"Propaganda"?
It's a charity you retards.
"I am not hungry" biggest lie ever
Next thing after this video. A second day zombie apocalypse
This hit me real hard ;-;
Man the world has changed.
why was she holding something that says Missing Dad & Husband?
😭😭😭
Nice acting
This is horrible.
😢
Childrens OK but no Children fuckers
this can be a movie
if there would ever be a move for the last of us that girl should be staring it
These videos make me cry
Records herself with a gun to her head...
where does this video place tooks? Paris?
i just watched the first one. i am no joke crying.  even though your poor in your area your very rich for many people.
She kind of reminds me of Bonnie Wright
I'm starting to cry...Its to sad
My birth day is the 16th too
Please i need another one
What happens after that
Im crying
This video is so powerful. It shows people what others like her are going through while we just sit at home on our phones whining if it runs out of battery. Videos like this help me understand what I have. Clean water, food, an education and freedom. Things some of them could only dream of.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽I'm praying for all of the refugees all the suffer 🙏🏽
This is surely fake
watch this video again and try not to cry
The fact that she had the little boy through all this was touching.
xD
I am crying because of two things. 1. The WHOLE story 2. I could never get a girl as pretty as her... yes I am around her age...
so cute
hard to think it is happening read the bible more people and you will see the horrors of the future by not following god
When his little friend said i want my mummy and daddy.... i cried my eyes out,i think i dont have any water inside me i could die but i would do anything even DIE for those kids to live happily... not only them, ALL the kids and family living like this, god bless
I wish they didn't take away the boy cause she said "he's all I got..."
after i watched this video, i thought about if the same thing happened to me. I kept thinking about it and i couldn't stop crying. I watched some SevenSuperGirls to make me feel better.
This made me cry
I hope when Isis are ripped to shreds they'll make a happy ending
1:20 lol
Rose Parker screw you
28 weeks later was better than this
#Prayfortheworld :(
I've been waiting for years for pt. 2
save children
last of us in real life
This is awful. I try and put this kind of thing out of my mind, but it's real and it's happening now and it's terrible
these are so heartbreaking and it spreads the word and that's what we need
Save the Children , Médecins Sans Frontières and The Red Cross are all colluding with people smugglers to facilitate the illegal invasion of Europe.
They are not "Rescuing" people as they claim but are instead collecting boat loads of illegal migrants from rendezvous points 12 miles off the Libyan coast that have been prearranged by telephone and are turning off their ships transponders to try to hide their activities.
They continue to do this despite knowing that ISIS are inserting thousands of fighters into the migrant stream - They are literally providing a ferry service for people who want to blow up our children.
All of this (transponder signals, radar records and telephone conversations) has been recorded by Italian prosecutors.
If these were indeed rescues, then international law would require the people rescued to be dropped of at he nearest safe port - Tripoli. This is not happening. Instead, they are being delivered to Europe.

If this wasn't true, STC, BRC and other NGO's would be refuting these claims, instead they disable comments on many of their videos.

None of these organisations will ever see another penny from me.
. . .
Is it just me or would this be a great movie?
on the beach the guys say in dutch help me over here
plz make another one I realy want to see what happens next
Poor girl had to learn to grow up so fast to take care of her brother....
She froze at wish. She didn't wish, did she?  ;(
Im crying from these videos...
*im not getting on the boat without you* boat:vroooomm
was this all acted because how would the camera man be taking all of this
this should seriously be made into a movie
top ten anime battles
I feel more appreciated
oh i only just understood the end. she is thinking about the moment a year ago when her mum said the some thing
Both times, at the end on her birthday she stares straight at us...
But I mean, how hard could it possibly be to get out of England?
I feel bad for these people💔🤧
I wish i switched lives with her i would do anything to make her happy😢😢
who else cried when she said he's all I got left





:(😫😫😫😯😯😥😥😥😔😔😔😔🙁😖😖😞😞😞😟😟😟😢😢😢😭😭😭😩😩😩😧😧😦
Watching this video reminds me of how lucky I am compared to her.
My favorite part was 1:56 because I CAN'T HANDLE MY EMOTIONS RN AND MY MOM THINKS IM CRAZY CAUSE IM CRYING FOR NO REASON😥
how did they get this all recorded?
OMG IT mare me cry and ill do anything for her !
This one hit me harder than the other one 😰
I almost cried
when he siad "I lost my momy and dady..." i lost it so much
I know the situation is real but are these videos actually real? Bc there's no way they can record like that
i hop it dont hapnd in Kuwait
This is like the walking dead all over agian

😢😢😢😢😢😿😿😿😿😿😢😢
I can't believe it. Why are these people doing such things? It's so goddamn heartbreaking.
the part where she lost her brother and mum hit me. She already lost her dad :(. Sadly this is real, no child should have to go through this
i feel so bad for thosw people i wonld let them stay at my house. this made me cry for a long time
hayden storm lmao right. Because posting something on a PUBLIC video on a PUBLIC website makes it only a personal business thing.
Random Person, shut up if you say that you have no heart. So I suggest you to mind your own business.
In actual reality you probably wouldn’t.
dragon thao why did you say that??
Poor girl! DAMN ISIS!
I would cry

But me eyes are so, so dry...
Who is recording this?
for every children who lost their parents or got lost in war I hope they will have a good life in future honestly I saw first part I was shocked this part was even sadder ,I don't even know what to say war is tragedy why humanity invented guns tanks and other war stuff why can't we live in peace 😪
It's like the zombie apocalypse
Tvis so deppresing OMG
DIOS MIO PADRE
this was uploaded on my birthday.
HER BIRTHDAY IS THE DAY BEFORE MINE
my only hope is they will have the best of luck and make it threw
I'm so sad I'm crying ;-;
This hit me
just to think this is happing NOW in our world....
is it fake
I feel so bad for everyone who has to go through life like this. Why does the human race think it's ok to hurt others. We're all human
if your a girl and have a baby brother just you and him think of this as you and your brother u will cry
pause at 0:22 THAT IS SUPER SCARY!!!!!
that is so sad that that is happening in the world
M
Sad :(
I pray for everyone who is suffering from the war. God Bless all. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️
MAKE AN OTHER ONE!!!!!! PLEASE I LOVE THESE!!!!
me while watching a video:*cries*
me scrollong through the comments:Wow Tom how are you
is this real
Who came here because of reaction time
1:06 what did that guy say?
😭😭😭😭😭
Are these real? Please tell me
Did-did she make it?
dang....................
That poor little boy
He's to young 
She is a great girl for caring so much
I wish there was one more of these video
how could someone dislike this?
The thing about life is there will ALWAYS be someone who disagrees, people were made the same way but think differently, no matter how hard you try someone will disagree with any word spoken.
Or maybe they don't want to see this in there recommendations duh
because many people are paranoid fucks nowadays who think this is "propaganda"
#SAVETHECHILDRENSREFUGEES
Once again, who does this to anybody?!?! I understand conflict, but this is insane. I wish I could help.
i really hope all those people are okay
I cried
THANK YOU GUYS . REALLY THANK YOU THAT YOU'RE STANDING UP AND SHOWING THE HEARTBREAKING REALITY .
como é  o nome dessa menininha?
so sad
do you think that's the what really hapening? Do you think refugees are families that need help? I never saw a woman or child refugee only horible rapists going to europe nothing else
I have met many refugees and i can tell you, many different kinds of people are there. Men, women, children, a lot of people with different skin colours and sexualities, they all deserve help and a home in a safe country
*NoT yOuR sEnPaI* Please never desecrate this video with your comments again.
*NoT yOuR sEnPaI* you're joking right......?
Do you not know about the war that's been going on for 8 years? In Syria people are getting kicked out of their homes, losing families, and dying. You need to have some respect and some knowledge before you say something like that.
I have a friend who is from Syria she had a happy life 
A big house a big family
All got destroyed 
She's a very nice person also her family 
They bring me arabish food
I can't tell weather to like because the struggle is real and I want these kinds of people to just live and be Happy,
or to dislike because I am so sad and hate to see these people go through so much suffering!
😭
choquant
If he touched me I bet I will stab him in the damn throut
I'm so glad that I just came across your organization last year and decided to donate a small amount of money to you. It's not much, but at least it's all I can offer at present. I hope you can make good use of the donations and help stop such atrocity.
that was depressing
SAVE THEM I CANT BELIEVE IT HOW COULD THEY OMG😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😫
this is the funniest video ever
Powerful video.
PERFECT EXPLANATION OF SYRIA
Yesterday was her birthday!
happy birth day :)
ME: THIS IS SO SAD
*does nothing*
I really think this can be a GREAT NETFLIX show! and it will voice out the children under these circumstances!! great video!
John Miranda yes instead of donating and helping something let’s make it stupid by turning it into a show
OH MY GOSH YAAAS
John Miranda yes... that’s not a bad idea but it has to be real, not cinematographic. (Sorry for my bad english btw)
isto e um filme?
And at that point ladies and gentlemen, I would just kill myself.
she went through aloottt
so sad😢😢😢
part 3 please
Thumbs up for the Director who made this!!
The camera is still clean tho
Furno then I guess he should of said giving a thumps up
dragon thao he ain't asking for likes he's just saying he's giving a thumbs up to the director
It makes me sad videos like this have to be made to spread awareness.
Did she say "6th of may 2003"?? Thats My birthday and everything....
1:04 Paris.
Bitch what. Why is this in the uk
so sad 😭😔😩😣😦😳😯😖😫🙀😿
More with the zombies plz don't let this girl die
والله ينفع يكون فلام او مسلسل الي معاياه
You can bet damn well, that if this were happening in the uk...NATO would have already intervened, is this add suggesting that a huge global military presence should be inserted into Syria?
talented little actress. it'd be cool to see her on a tv screen or in a movie someday.
This is british deception to brainwash innocent people for their agenda. Just check my small youtube video "Britain's treacheries during world war 1 and world war 2" for the hidden truth.
😭😭😭 can't fight back the tears!!!
She'd make a great Ellie from The Last of Us
it's so sad that Ur life could completely change so quickly
If you're hating your life right now stop and think for a second about the homeless, the poor, the orphans living by themselves out there WISHING they had your life!
this is so sad
This reminds me of The movie & book

"Children of Men" for some reason
I have a friend from Syria and he did survive to escape and come to Kuwait before it's gonna get worse. I still feel bad for the others. :(
I love this video it makes the viewer step out of their shoes and take a walk in someone else. She is great actress
just like the other she lost a part of her family now that is sad the whole vid is sad
is this real
im just asking.. is this actually real?
They need a thirth video
Why would someone dislike the video
she's my type
This is so sad.
When she says "I'm not hungry" and then 'He's all I've got left" 
My poor heart. I cried so hard for this. It breaks my heart that this actually happens in the world
My brother fled from death in Syria across the sea and this is what he suffered on his way🙁
끄헝
Hope you made a wish...?... what.... what like I jus- I just... I Can't even!
This is so sad, I'm thankful I'm living in peace.
Is this real? it looks real, but i don't know how she even took a video when does stuff are happening. especially when she wake up and the camera was ALREADY recording her
Can anyone explain why this is happening and what we can do about it plz?
omg heartbreaking.
Trump is a monster for judging these poor innocent refugees and not allowing into the USA.
even my baby brother and sister
I'm crying her little brother is so cute 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I love uuuu I will never let anyone hurt u both
I got something in my eye... ITS TEARS QAQ
This is so sad!😱😭😢😢
What's the girl's name
first the mum says she's not hungry so her daughter can be fed, then her daughter says she's not hungry so the little boy she's looking after can be fed. subtle but powerful. war robs kids of their right to be kids.
OMG so sad
what is going on😦😩😟😞🙍👫
Good vid it made me cry like if you had any emotion
Abigail Caines I had no emotion if you get triggerd over me saying that I swear to god
I didn’t cry because I don’t cry a lot, but I may not have cried but this is a strong topic and I think we need to stop war and save these people.
U r the type of person who would cry to a mama joke
I won't cry... I won't cry
*cries
the stare at tha end tho :(
OMG HI TOM SKA! I LOVE UR VIDS! but this vid is heartbreaking :(
agora não sei se isso é verdade ou não essa história dá menina
why dose everyone want to kill her?
Daaaaamn lord
Unaccompanied children entering Europe as refugees are often abducted/sexually exploited/abused/sold for organs!
50% of refugee children go missing within 48 hours in Greece!
Authorities should investigate the role and motives of numerous obscure NGOs.

This is ganna happen soon
What is a second in a day video
Everybody help now be grateful that you have a home and a family
she's pretty
I can't believe it😱😱😱
Another one
These are the days I'm happy to live in America and in my home and having a good life and BREATHING
this is so sad
Wow if I knew it was like this for refugees I would help charity's
This isn't our problem it's syria so let them deal with it and everyone else back off don't get involved
I would adopt her as my sister. Stop her suffering
This made me cry again ☹️☹️☹️😢😢😢😢😢
nice video
Isn't emotional blackmail a really good way to get people to donate to your charity? Jeez... I hate it when people use emotional blackmail. Otherwise a very good video.
nerd O_O 

Those dog commercials aren't real. But they use them because nobody donates anymore. It's all about my money, my land, my government, my community. Not ours. People aren't willing to share nowadays. In the US some ppl feel that immagrants are taking jobs yet 75 percent of the homeless population in America are pan handlers or choose to not work.
gamergirl 

yeah i see ur point, but I still don't trust those dog commercials lol
nerd O_O well yes, but have we forgotten that donations are for saving the things that they are saving you, the money in those are going to helping the dogs not just their wallets, same for this, that is the concept of donation, and this is just showing what is happening to show what they will stop and need help from more to stop.
have u ever seen those commercials with the cute dog pictures and how it wants you to donate to them to save them? they're just trying to make u sad to donate. that's basically this.
Yoshi3000 it is trying to show you what is happening right now to show what they want you to donate towards stopping, it is showing the problem they want to solve, it isn’t trying to use a sad story to their advances, it is explaining what happens everyday and that it isn’t a light matter.
Is the the new cod?
Who's the actor ?
My mom works in save the children
Again, it's just GOTTA be a really accurate fake
I FEEL SORRY FOR THIS STORY I HOPE THIS STORY MANES SOMETHING TO YOU GUYS
Why can't the world just have peace and love?It's sad to hear and see that many children have to go through this much pain without their parents.
remind me of Ellie.
Amazing video!!(And she is the same age as me so horrable to think this woukd happen...)
WHY IS THIS SOOOOOO SAD??!!
are you ok
fat
where are they when this happened to them
キツイな。
何を目的に戦っているのか、日本人には分からないよ。
Bombs on monday.
this would be an amazing movie
Scariest part was waking up no parents to help her. She had to be strong and she protected the boy the way her parents tried to protect her
WHO CUT THE UNIONS!!
she has the same phone as me
how war ruins everything slowly
This girl's life is getting worse and worse...I wish I kould help someone like her
so stupid
who is that girl
Guys don't worry it's all just on a script remember that peace
Why would someone record this?
Stop making these commercials and make a movie
This literally made me cry my ass off....
"We have found a home for him"
"N-no! Hes all I got..."
*SAAAAAAAAAAADDDD* Its like me and my brother.....I DONT WANT TO LOSE HIM EVEN THOUGH HE IS COMPLETELY ANNOYING!! D:
on the 16th of may I am going to  wish everyone to have a great birthday to wish there family,friends,stangers a good life But I WILL NEVER WISH THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED THIS WAR!!!
;(
I cried BECAUSE THIS SO SAAAD WHHHAAA😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😫😫
When I grow up I am going to adopt a bunch of kids from third world countries.I'm going to get the big kids because nowadays people take small children and leave the big ones.It's tragic.
Whats the most horrible part, is that I had no idea this was happening.
Why would you only save the children? Adults still have time to you know and some kids these days aren't going to progress the future they may ruin it, being stuck into their phones all day and night
ww3 its coming so pls prepare yourself
I have a daughter and this touched a nerve. Very well made and makes you think hard about the world today.
She kind of makes me think about Clementine from telltale series The Walking Dead only in world war 3
BIG BEN this is what is happening in the world it’s not ww3 it’s what’s happening in Syria right now 😭😭
Omg my sisters name is clementyne :O
This isn't the purpose of the video? SMH.
BIG BEN Same
She's like exactly Clementine, with AJ and losing Lee ):
That girl in my opinion is tough
Just think now we can't save these kids because of trumps stupid ban. Innocent children are being abandoned and killed.
I feel bad
Horrible. But amazingly done
So my question is "Where is the love?"
This is fake video right??? Because I'm crying I know this it happening I really want to hug that girl!
This is so inspiring
well it was really sad once again but still it ended a little happily well she lost everything but she has a home now
"he's all ive got left" damn just made me appreciate my life a little more. Cant live without my brothers
OMG IM CRYING BECAUSE THIS IS SAD STORY 😭😭😭😭
i hate who this happened
omg.....
I would cry for months If my mother died...
Liliana has had such a bad life , pretty sure that this makes her 14... She lost her mum and dad. Its such a shame that this video had to be made...
I think there should be a version of this for the US, that way I can show it to everyone and they'd be able to put that into perspective
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢#stopchildrefuge
I will never ever think that saving children from warzones is wrong. This happens to kids. WE NEED TO SAVE THEM.
Wie had ook het "Help me even" stukje gehoord
i watched this on reaction time subscribe to him he is awesome!!!!!
In real life the parents would let the kids back there and go on the boat alone.
REFUGEES ARE HUMANS! AND WE ARE HUMANS TOO....What WRONG with the WORLD right NOW ACTUALLY?!!! I don't understand HUMAN BEING even I'm a HUMAN
it is so hart breaking😢
That poor little girl
Is this real?
someone should make a movie about this.. and also, no child from any background deserves this. shame this short had to be made
I think I felt what and where my vocation is. Thank you for making such an amazing change in the world. It is terrible to see this things and to know that are many people suffering so much in the world. Thank you for keeping this in mind of the ones that are lucky to have a great life. I strongly believe that I found my passion, helping the ones that are in need. Thank you
😓
this is tragically beautiful
POOR LIL GIRL
ffs
I wish there's a movie for this.
#savethechildren
People are so messed up! I know this just a fake video but in real life it's happening even as today.
I cried a little when someone said there's only enough for one more person on the boat:( so thankful that I have a mom😩💓
I want to cry.. I really want to but for some reason I'm not crying..
she looks like x23 from logan
Where heppening this? 😢
she look like my friend but my friend is japanese
one sad very sad but two is a question. I dont watch news or anything does this kinda stuff really happen? im guessing yes
what's happening?
WOW a heartbreaking video.. let's hope this never happens...
you sick fucks will go to no end...reminds me of a pet refuge commercial..just like the clinton foundation about 15 percent of your money will actually go to help these kids.thevrest of it goes to steak dinners for the liberals running this corrupt charity!
1:14 GET OFF BITCH! XD
This really puts things into perspective...
Im crying
I like war.hope all children suffer war
they need to make a movie
wow what a life
I can't image how is this girl feeling... I can't imagine the situacion, Iam born to war, Iam growing up in war, fighting for my life, losing everything. My big wish is help ol of this innocent children...

Please, don't be angry because of my english. Czech Republic.
why ;-; whyyyy ;-; i want everyone happy (bądź english?)
... bad no bądź...
Poor kids...Some people are brutal.. :-(
Wow!!!

Did this really happened
#crys
The moment when you hate your life and then compare to children that are going through this...
HA!!! Sucks to be them!
I feel so Bad 😔😪 I could help I will talk to child for me kill me so
I'm so glad I saw this. I forget how spoiled I can be sometimes and then I complain when I'm not aloud to have an extra Oreo. This gives me a new view on how to live my life. So whoever made this, thank you for showing everyone how it is to not have a guarantee on where they are sleeping tonight or if they will even live to see the next day.
WTF WHY IS THE WORLD STILL MESSED UP WE ALREADY HAD 2 CIVIL WARS NO MORE DONALD TRUMP PROBLAY GOING TO START WORLD WAR 3
WOW!!! YOU POST THIS 2 DAYS FROM MY BIRTHDAY ...!!WOW!!!!!!!!!
Alles Gute zum Geburtstag Lille

Another one I cry! Nothing makes me cry!!! But this does, I want to help them, someday I want to! It's a passion, some day we all can! If we try!

0:36 "I will find you"

0:19 why were they doing that to her?
I'm from Singapore. Please let us donate too.
this makes me cry
I hope every republican sees this
OMG THIS IS SO SAD!!!!
JUST THINKING THAT THOSE CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO IS JUST HEART BREAKING! !!!
I don't understand why you all ask for this to be a movie. IT'S REALITY, GUYS. These promos are made for us to understand what is going on, it's not for entertainment.
I shouldn't have watched this! Cause I was so close to crying!
IM CRYING MY EYES OUT.
Will it be the case?
OMG 😨
😭
Yoooooo she has the same birthday as me but one year earlier!!!!!!!
alright been watching too much sad videos I have to 
watch papa franku
what happened
Australians be like (they come for welfare, go back to your own country)
My country have a lot of refugees from Ukraine, but other countries still say that we don't let them in... Damn you europe! I'm in Poland!
time to go to Canada by youtube
this reminds me SO MUCH of the last of us!
Okay last time... very relevant. But given the racial tensions happening world wide as refugees try to find a place in a world of distrust and anger... well, the threequel will take place in Europe with the struggle happening all over again. This story will all be too real, but more than ever needs to be told.
so many things going on in the world.why can't we all  just get along for once?....no i guess not😢well life goes on ain't nothing we can do about it😭
This should be made into a film very good
That part when they asked r u related and she said no ..I mean that is really
this is so amazing.
make this a movie please
i live in syra
Such a sweet and sad video 😢❤
..."Wir erreichen jetzt [...]"
German! Nice^^
(Don't get me wrong, it's a really sad and emotional video, but I think it's funny to hear some German as a German guy^^)
aww when the girl said "I'm not getting on the boat without you"
So sad
Where is this happening?!?!
I thought they wouldent be aloud kill women and children
Her name is Lillianna and so is mine
I cried and sobbed so many times
This is sad, it made me realize how fortunate I am
she's still beautiful 😭😍😍
Notice 1:15 - a reference to the camera woman who was filmed tripping up a refugee and kicking another: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/camerawoman-filmed-tripping-up-and-kicking-refugees-petra-laszlo-hungary-jail-charged-breach-of-the-a7230281.html
That’s not a camera it was a weopon
Well spotted
Same...shame she is hungarian😣
Man i was about to comment the same thing
Who is this girl ? 😭😭
that's sad
with all the "refugees" coming to europe this will be our reality cause they are bringing their problems with them.
This made me cry
;-;
Brilliant Ad.

This is horrible...
IS THIS REAL!?
so sad
this makes me sad


like a lot of things
like maths 
but this is still sad
make a third one I want to see more so sad but war! needs to end for good
Gabriela Bernal Well, I'm sorry to bump into you, but given Trump and tensions in Europe, there is a likelihood a third may happen. But either way, we would be all better off if the war ended.
OMgosh this is sooooooooooo sad i wish there would be a good end
This is what happens in the countries that get bombed. This is what it would be like for the western of the world (wealthier countries)
0:29 rip angel of the north
OMG this is very good video
If the video isn't playing you will see this ""Loading Please Wait . . . ████████████████████] 99%""

"'Merry Christmas" 
*1 Second Later* 
"ON YOUR KNEES NOW!!!!!!"
It's so sad how it turned from the mum saying im not hungry to the girl saying that.



What does checkpoint mean???
Great
What's more sad are those comments... Never thought people could actually be that stupid.
This a amazing video but sad its happening in real life
"The British are coming!"


You know who said it :>)
Nope :>) 
It was The Lenape, Powhatan, Catawba, Iroquois, Timucua, Algonquin, Mahican, Penobsoot, Cherokee, Susquehanna, Ottowa, Northern Canadian Inuit, Haida, Cree, Blackfoot, , Kainai, Métis , Mi'kmaq, Ojibway, Maya (in what is today Belize), The cayman Island peoples, Jamaica, barbuda, Grenada, Anguilla, the British virgin islands, all other Indian tribes in British owned North and South America, 
The Dutch, The Spanish, The French, The Germans, The Italians, The Russians, The danish,  The Americans, The Chinese, The japanese, Thai people, The Vichy french, The Nepalese, probably the Maltese, The Arabs, North Koreans, the Kurds, Greek people, 
The Nawab of Bengal, The Maratha Empire, The Nawab of Carnatic, Vijayanagara Empire, The Kingdom of Mysore, The Nawab of Oudh,  Nizam's dominions (Before the British officially made it the princely state of Hyderabad), The rajput states (before the British annexed them into the British raj), The Sikh empire, Nawab of Bahawalpur, The Nawab of Sindh, Burma, Kandy (a state in what is now Sri Lanka),  all the other Indian states it went to war with,
Muscat and Oman, 
The Madhists, The Egyptians, The zulus, The Fulani Jihad Empire, The African states of Mane, Ashanti, bundu, jolof, Geledi, Zanzibar, Warsangali, The dervish state, South rodesia, natal,
The natives of Papua new guinea, Sarawak, 

And Paul Revere.

And that's just a few of them.






Oh and by the way,
The Ottomans imploded and became Turkey.













I swear that took like, 2 hours to do.
The pesky ottomans? :>)
i cried because of this and she saved that boy took care of him
is nobody gonna talk about the typo at the end? okay then....
All of u saying Great Video but the next time u see a refugee u scream go back to ur own country
Um what child refugees?!
For all those selfish European who refuse to let Refugees in, you kill thousands of innocent Children!
If a single one did such a thing it shouldn't be handled lightly.
but not all of them.
Well think about it. If you knew they were going to massacre your people, why care for them?
I don't care I'm an American why are they asking for our help we need to help our selves first we are 20 trillion dollars in debt it's not like we can do anything at this point. Don't even bring the kids in this cause that girl is just an actor and not even Syrian, because you know why most of the Syrian refugees are men who come to other countries to kill their own people. They are fooling YOU.
Very inspiring video :) Just shame things like this happen in the world :C
I wish this never happens in my life,i have a 10 mouth old sis and a 2 year old bro,Oh Jesus help me and them and let me and them have a blessing life ^^
After all these problems the refuges go through, and Trump says, "Nope! I'm not allowing refuges into this country anymore," 👱🏻😡
How do I find a refugee to sponsor?
is the girl  a actor or she records her life
I HATE war because not only it's scary kids lose there family or lose contact with them and SO many people are being killed 😢
#RefugeesNotWelcome
to mr trumps,u should watch this... my eyes... huhu T.T
I feel really bad :(
ALLAHU AKBAR!
Is this real ??
Someone make a heartbreaking video game about this.
THE GIRL WHO WON'T GIVE UP
:( #
where is this happening?
This is sad liek OMG LIKE THIS IF YOu THINK THIS IS sad
She remind me so much clementine from the walking dead
Right XD
I have the same birthday as her.....
I might regret typing this but these videos are so great I keep thinking it's a trailer for a movie
War in Britain. something I would not imagine
"Make a Wish"
"........I wish that I would've been in his new family too. I wish that he could've stayed with me. I wish my mom were here. I wish my dad were here. I wish that I didn't have to be here. I wish that I could be happy.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I WANT?!" -That would be me,no lie
What?
Who took the boy away from her?
And why?
Peggy Schuyler A family adopted the boy in case he was orphaned. Case in point, "his parents drowned".
So sad
Kill me please
Two minutes of this video tells better story than the whole series of Twilight!
The Amazings Top that’s what’s important to you?
i know this is real but..
i wish this was a show..
She didn't make a wish didn't she?
This is what is going to happen to all of us BECSUSE OF DOLALD TRUMP!
this is so sad
sub me also
<3
this is so sad
These vids are so sad. Its so sad that this is happening. It makes you want to donate so bad!
Even if these recording aren't actually real, it's still represented to spread awareness. I love these types of videos since it still shows what can happen.
Heartbreaking 😭💔
Some people can't leave there stuck now that Donald Trump is president!
At 0:55 you can hear a Dutch man saying " help mij even / help me out"
Which.. is kinda accurate if fictionally Britain refugees used boats and ... landed in the Netherlands.
Very good commercial
Rage Rawke Mind blown. We thought they landed in Normandy, France, but this theory... Netherlands, Belgium (hence "Pas de Anglais" graffiti), and somewhere in Germany. I thought they went through France.
01:33 that moment when the girl looked right at the camera, tears were flooding my face & heart stopped for a second.

Sad truth: Life is beautiful but not for everyone.
I know this was probably an acting to make people want to help but.. IM STILL SO SAD FOR HER!!!!
It's like the titanic
shes in the movie 
"A Monster Calls" in the class looking at the boy
Mom?
😢😭
She messed up at 1:20
This is why Donald Trump must be removed.
how is this trump fault
Carolyn so your saying we should have things sugar coated about real life and when the bomb drops stuff happens?
deadboxman and guess who started it!
Peter exatctly
deadboxman you think this is Donald trump that you saw was isis
0:53 they say sia has no impact
I'll be ur freind
omg...
I just want this to be an actual movie!
Thanks! Now i understand how refugees have it. Exept refugees from syria dosen't look that freash. (Compared with the girl that was brittish)
:'(
If this was a movie, I would buy it on blu ray.
Kayla LK v
Barefoot Gen is similar.
Is this world war 3?
*lets ban them*
What happened at 0:20 ?
Rabid Leroy Fan Portal IRA?
this is overly dramatic
This is so sad and i know its happening for real but, is this video real?
War in Britain? I dont know a war in Britain after WW2;)
oh my god
its riduculous how ppl want this made into a movie. How can u make this into a movie when these kind of things are STILL happening? Yeah maybe if this situation stops then u can make a movie out of this but not rn when the event is still happening.
brilliant as I can see this video is telling me that the people who gets in the barc to arrive in sicily are refugees, *BULLSHIT*, they are illegal economic immigrants, in Senegal there isn't any war, also in the majority of the country where they came from there isn't a war, 90% of them aren't refugees, in Italy, they were sent in a hotel and they also had breakfast, lunch and dinner with an import of 35€ in a day for a immigrant were there are people at Amatrice that sleeps in a tent with no heating at -18 grade, with almost 2 metres of snow and the risk that another earthquake completely finish them, stop saying bullshit Save the children, you should tell the truth
do I am the only who were more interested of the war scenario than of the refugees? XD
please don't tell me her parents died on her birthday
Make part three

Please
戦争はダメですね
i cried so much i cried on my pillo
I NEED ANOTHER SEQUEL,
make a third one
Cool
lol
im dead lolll
lmao
rofl
How many damn birthdays does she have?
Clementine Marsh I meant 9 birthdays
You are younger then 9?
Clementine Marsh wish I had 9
9?
Is it just me or does the young actress bear a resemblance to Anne Frank (also a refugee denied a visa)?
Wow.
if all you're focusing on is how great of an actress the girl is or what a wonderful, heartfelt, tearjerking movie this would be, you're missing the point. wake up. 
Is this in the middle of a war?
im so grateful, for all the world please save the children
wait what happened
Wonder Wolf this video talk about the war in the middle east
it's sad that everybody happens to then😖
I cried. I wish everyone I loved is happy😭😭😩😩
my birthday is also may 16
These are sad for me
Thanks for showing us what's happening really in the world
XxsophxX Hammersley yeah u are right I feel bad
XxsophxX Hammersley ikr this
sad
this girl looks like Anne Frank.
IM CRYING 😢
0:06 More than this by Patrick Ness. That book is amaazing!
Viola Eade hole in the Noise another good book by him is "The Rest Of Us Just Live Here"
S  YES!! PATRICK NESS IS A WRITING GOD!!!
S it is!!
Why does this have to happen, just let peace into the world!!
I just noticed something, at 0:13 the mom says she's not hungry so the girl can get all the food, then at 1:15 it's the girl saying she isn't hungry.. these subtle things really make this video even better and realistic
I'm heartless....I didn't cry but, this video got me.
I cried
Perfectly accurate showing of what Europe will look like if refugees keep coming in.

And no, I don't regret what I just said.
Good. Have a nice day.
@11thDoctor's Companion Agreed
Forget it. This will only be an enormous waste of time for both of us.
@11thDoctor's Companion Ok, and?
You don't get the point of this video.
How dare you simulate crisis for a second time for financial growth. This isn't a tv series. its a message. You've said your message in that other video. you're done
DickSneezeMcgee For God's Sake, they aren't doing it for financial gain! It's to RAISE AWARENESS.
Conqueror C it's leviosA not leviosa
IT'S MADE BY SAVE THE CHILDREN, WHICH IS A CHARITY.
Well, some people still cannot get themselves to see refugees as people, or understand the fact some of them are children. If the first video was as effective as you imply it was, another won't be needed.
Its sad how they had to use a white girl for people to care
Plus, most people are white, they could maybe better put their children in her place because of a small lookalike
Think of it, we are in The United Kingdom, you can hear a man saying to the girl "British scum!" They probaly went for a white girl because most people in The United Kingdom are white. The videos point are to show us what war does to children, so they hit the united kingdom because most people watching this are probaly from UK.
Why a white girl? Does it really matter if she is black, white or asian? No It dosent.
It is racist itself for you and him to say that kind of stuff you know that?
dotcom this guy never said that he wouldn't care if it wasn't a white girl guys he's just stating the fact and I actually believe it's kinda true
Your racist saying that idiot
Refugees do not deserve sympathy
nx g get a life
nx g why?
thanks
it is just beautiful how she took him I  like he was her own.
You can make this Stope
PLEASSSEE!!!
CAN YOU MAKE NUMBER 3??
thank you for showing us what is going on in this mess of a world we should all try to help
😢 اخخخ يا ربي  يا قره عيني يا يمن يا وجه الااه اللهم احفظ جميع بلداننا الاسلاميه
This kills me. Especially the part when the little boy goes away. :(

Thats really scary and sad.
That escalates quickly
This PSA series has literally haunted me and has given me nightmares.
I swear this girl Will become stronger than Lara Croft Nathan Drake and a God
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
epic
And what disgusts me is that people joke about this.
Edit: this comment is annoying and I don’t agree with it now alright jesus christ
Levi Addict no you joke about things that aren’t serious. You don’t have to joke about everything. Sometimes you need to understand when you have gone too far.
I wonder what is their reaction when someone make fun of one of their family member's death.
@WataKashi ikr. This is not a joke. They are making joke just because they never experience it.
They aren't being serious,They know what means this video
Haha nice joke
For all the people saying I need a happy ending. Well hate to break it to ya but there is none.
I speaking English little, but I understand what they are said, it is very Beautiful
I watching part one and all the film is amazing and sad
Apparently the internet is messed up and filled with ignorance
@NITRO_ M art cat Uh...No. She isn't. She is probably learning but it's hardly good. You don't need to suck her off for her comment to stand
dragon thao, ...
Hoar Michel . Oh ya? U sapeaking little of engrish? I da helping u sapeaking betteh engrish no time.
Yea this is sad 😢 i feel soooo bad for Syrian people. But if i can... help.
Please do the final happy ending to "most shocking second a day" please make me cry of happiness 😢😢😢
Hate to break it to you, but there is no happy ending.
Dear UK,you can let you'r people to live in Bulgaria!Don't be shy!At least it's safe here in Bulgaria!
Well then you don't get the friggin point of this video.
Do you say that to Syria to?
this really happened
Those 1500 haters, who disliked this video, do not care about the poor children, who suffer through this. if they get put in this situation, and they have haters, they may lose hope. Please. Help them
I NEED A HAPPY ENDING
ths made me cry
İs she really there so is she really  there?
But how do u save her?
IM SO SADDDD
This actress is so beautiful
just sad...
She's lucky
How blind can we all be? Humans are humans, we are of one species, we should care for one another! Awareness is necessary, but Altruism is a better answer. Thank you for the Advocates who made this video series.
I feel bad about this plz stop doing this please
herecomesdatlucy oshitwaddup That's true it just breaks my heart to see this happing
Sebastian And Sasha People need to be educated.
is this real or is she an actor? cos if shes an actor she's really good
Lindsay Applegate are u kidding me rn
Look at the bright side at least she isn´t Maria or Elena.
WHAT IS THE WORLD ACCOMPLISHING IN WAR?... EXACTLY
😔😔😔😭😭
0:21-0:23 was awful
...As tragic and upsetting as this is...I can't help but be bothered by the fact that the British military apparently has A-10s?
That girl is so brace cuz she..well....look at the vid if u don't think she is.she drove next to a bomb that exploded and someone from ISIS I think tried to take her and she wasn't crying.she might not be beautiful to u but she is to me if u don't think she is beautiful u don't know what' she's been thro
shes an actor bro
You should make a part 3
oh my God this was so sad... especially when they took Alfle away from Lily (the girl and boy)
this messed me up so much because the girl's name is Lily... that's my name too.
ok I wanna describe a scene 


Lily realizes the raft is going to flip over
She takes her life jacket of and gives it to the little boy next to him 
As the raft starts to flip she holds the boy closely 
As they fall into the water she does her best to grab on 
She lets the boy go and falls unconscious 
She awakens on the shore , at the shelter she does everything to keep the boy save and healthy , like a mother , the boy is heartbroken that he is now an orphan ...
The boy gets adopted , and the loving girl loses the last thing she loves..






*cries*
Bwommp 
I didn't say anything about her mom 
._. Can you read better
Emily Lilly dosen't know where her mum is
kaity wesley
Yea she didn't the boy got adopted and she was left with nothing
but Lily don't get adopted?...
"He's all I've got left "






*SOBS*
55 million new the beginning but 54 million don't know what happened next
fake
at 1:13 who else heard GET OFF BETCH!!! 😂😂😂 even tho it is sad and i would say and do that
Jennifer gaspar I was never talking to you so shut up
Awe this is so sad 😭😢😥😵😲🤕😧😱😖😔😞😕🙁😟☹️😣😰
seriously these are so brilliant!!!
British refugees Lawl.
sad. I was crying
cual país es ese pobre niña cuando vi el vídeo se me rompió el. corazoon
We all know they are all able bodied military aged men.
Asma Yusuf you are the stupid one and I was not even talking to you so stop talking
Kauan pingas no I won't die but you could die I have a long future not like you
Hilarious superiority I was not even talking to you so shut up
if this don't bring a tears then mainstream has done its job by desensitizing you
We need to make a US version.
i bet the word would get out if there was a movie, but they would need the money to make a the movie and the advertising.
I lik the Little Girl
I did
Beautifully shot and very powerfully done. This touched me in a way that few PSAs do. This should be a movie.
appeal to emotion
I gave money to help save refugee children and then when the children arrived here they looked a lot like adult men with facial hair....
This is propaganda with a hidden agenda trying to take advantage of humans empathy towards children.
Its happening in my country of Syria. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DoxQyXkddM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyLVZvIKgxY
We are killed for no reason. SO we have to escape.
Sunni Bunni, what is happening right now, and is this a fair and balanced representation of it? I'd be interested in hearing more.
It isn't propaganda. It's happening right now.
FutbolGeorgey, it's funny that you would say that.
no it isnt u moron
Woah that's fucked up
Alah Akbar!!!!!!!!!!!
😭😭😭😢😢
please make another one D:
Mandy GAMES ikr
And then she stole a truck and run over 40 people. The end.
This is nothing to joke about.
This hurts
Game Theorist Ghost exactly, I am pretty sure they won't be making comments like these if/when this happens to them.
You realize this is a *real* *thing* happening somewhere in the world right now, don't you? Joking about this isn't funny at all, making light of a serious issue is a horrible thing to do.
Ryuk hat is not funny...
😭😭😭😭
60 millones de personas han sido forzadas a huir de sus hogares debido a la crisis de refugiados y los niños han sido los mas afectados. Esta crisis sigue sucediendo el dia de hoy y este video busca transmitir el horror y sufrimiento que nuestros hermanos estan sufriendo.
knack?
People look up removed I literally cried my eyes out when I watched it,it's so inspiring.
Ps This Video is about a girl in a war
Did you know water is wet?
YOU DON'T SAY
#SaveChildren
NITRO_ M art cat Uhm? How will the children take care of themselves without adults?
Donald Clinton 2020 children are the future
Cutie Friends Why only children? Why not the ADULTS?
what children
no child deserves this
I hope they make a third one to this.
Diaz Marche I hope they don't. It's too sad
Loser
1000th likeeee (it was really satisfying lmao)
gaming _lilyon because there is so much hatred in the world
I really hope they don't have to make another one. But in a way, I agree with you. To stop all of this cruelty in the world, yes, the message should be spread worldwide.
OH NOOOOOOOOO
Another amazing video! This really makes you realise what's going on in the world. My heart goes out to all who are suffering the same as this girl.
An hypotetical third year may be with the girl sent back to England by the french authorities under nationalist government.
After her return home, she may be forcefully be enrolled as a child soldier by the local militia, as a suicide bomber perhaps.
Horrible! I understand the pain all of these refugees are going with. I'm enjoying Christmas but I can't stop thinking about those who won't be enjoying the special holiday. My heart goes out to all of them and I will support them all until this stupid awful war will hopefully come to an end.
AWlpsSHOW36 agreed, but I don't know how to help.
wowww this is touching.
shes very strong now.
Now she´s lonely.
she looks so much like Elizabeth hiley!!!!!!!!!!!
WAIT THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW OH NO
i think korean started war then we are got a ww 3
Wait when did this even happen in France? or whenever I am sure this didn't happen after the more recent attacks.  (I am assuming it's France judging on the sign that said "Paris" and the fact the 1 clip with 2 soldiers it looked like the French Forces camo)
TYRES1987 Is that what they're calling empathy now? 'Emotional manipulation'?

Your mother must be so proud of you.
The Syrian refugees lost their refugee status as soon as they left the first safe country they got to. They are now economic migrants. This advert is nothing more than emotional manipulation. Shame on #savethechildren
The point of the video is what if the Syrian civil war happened in Britain.
we need a third!!! so sad though..
:'(
I've never seen such young, white girls in german refugee camps. A little unrealistic. But great video anyway!
Dunno if bait or not
😕😔😢😢😥😥😰😰😯
what percentage of donations goes towards helping them after admin cost?
https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4438 You can google websites that review charities as well as google charities for controversies now. Generally, any charity that donates 70% or more is a decent charity, but try to find to find ones with higher percentages. This charity uses 90% of all money to go to the children, and the rest for campaigns like this, payments, and other fund-raising purposes.
Crytears sunny   Most charities GI e less than 10%.
probably 1%.
I say, I want to solve poverty and world hunger one day, not by donating to corporations but by trying to make the difference myself. One person really can make a difference.
so sad
What a nice glimpse into the future of European children if the pouring of refugees into Europe continues.
I'm from Brazil and I want to volunteer
I would watch a movie like this...
Pqp meu coração ta doendo aaaaaaa 😢😰😭😭
1:14 nice touch to let the journalist tackle the refugee
Wouter Planet so im not the only one who saw it...
I did not realized that there was a second video
She's so pretty and brace I like ok up yo her BC of this
makes me cry every time she looks on the camera at the end 

#prayForAleppo Pray for the kids who have to go through all of this right know
Garbonzo Biehn it will
Praying will do nothing.
this is even worst then the first one
what do i do though.. :( Im just a kid
Oh, shoot!
THIS IS SO SAD IT MADE ME CRY I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THIS GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make my more the third one please!!! I want to cry even more please thank u
daym
This is amazing! Pray for the refugees!
why?
I lost it when she got separated from her Mom. Her Dad and brother were already gone, like come on. Then the boy got a home.
no child should suffer like this
It wouldve been awesome if they made this after Trump got elected.
😢😢😢😢😢
this is SO sad I'm out playing on my phone while other children are becoming like this. I wish there was someway to help. I'd do ANYTHING!😖😖😖😖
People today are grieving more for a god damn gorrilla, than these children. World today makes me sick...
it's so sad
Now if the first video and this video were a full length movie put together or a TV show...

I have wrote a movie script that is not related to these videos (hoping my first script gets somewhere) but I think I may start doing just that but I'm wondering what the ending would be like.
😢😢😢
All the dutch people: did you hear at 0:57 someone sayd "help even"
Dutch van der lin
"help move them" would not make sense ... they fled from the UK, why would they hear english
Ja omg 😲
Kritty no hé said help effe
who is the actor
This is so saf
Modern war is hell
Praying for them tonight 🙏
im sorry, i know this is a sad vid but your profile pic tho XD
BlueJWay999 well he or she didnt intentionally say it to the kids in the video, he or she might have been talking about the kids in Syria, the ones who are in danger,  saying that they will be praying for all of them.
They're not real. There are children in Syria and other countries who live this every day.
Why people have wars vilonce isn't the ansewr
beaux brodude That's just how the world is. Though wars are bad, both parties most likely won't agree to stop war.
Why this happen
The United States and France should be blame for the crisis because they plant war everywhere.
This Is Sooo Sad..........:(
The no English part made me more open minded about people that are muslem and things like that. Thank you !!!

Que dó
Bloody hell my heart is pounding out of my chest..
omg
Why would she record bad things in her life!
iiDalton it's fake idiot. but the situation is real
This clip looks like children of men,
Full stop, please.
Doesn't it. The Camp sequences specifically
the sad thing is that we can't do much about it..😭
I actually cried.
please tell me this is acting
This is simulated, but it's actually happening in Syria and many other places. This is a second a day formatted video of similar political unrest set in England, to try to get the viewer to empathize with the little girl, by provoking that exact reaction
NateMob1 lol okay hahha thanks
moriah jones it's acting
Thank you for these videos they are amazing and eye opening and I hope more people will see them. So again thank you
Does this happen to the immigrants right now in this video, or what tragedy is happing? Btw this video is soo sad😭
AG Wishes yes this is actually happening it is a real cause this young girl is acting it out really well. I couldn't imagine acting this out without crying all the time
These people are fleeing England where are they going? France?
This is where I'm donating this year, it's so sad oml
This is deep! But how does she have a camera through all of this and it still working? Was it acting?
TheWildBadger they are acting but this is happening in Syria
This is so sad 😭😭😭 omg and these are the people trump wants to keep out
Roses are red
violets are blue
I like trump
so should you.
Joy Watson yes it is! Or soon we'll be them
so why couldn't the mom go with her on the boat?
DarkEpyon123 because the boat was already overflowing with people
And died, probably.
there was only enough room for one more so the mom stayed
Who else is crying? 😭😭😭
1:15 isnt that the camera woman who was tripping refugees
This video gives me anxiety ugh
So that's why 95% of refugees are grown men
Cry me a river

When will syria and iraq see the happy end..
too cool
We watched this today in class and a classmate said seriously:"This looks so exciting tho! Where's the problem? I'd love to have a little fun, it's like hide and seek or COD!"
That's the problem, you know? This video is actually made to make people think but for people who are quite too dumb to use their brain or anything else this is just useless. You can't turn selfish people unselfish, if you know what I mean.
I think that's so sad because I love that video so much and it really really makes me think.. but sometimes I think about what is worse; the people who intentionally ignore the children in danger or the people that don't even "see the problem"?

Mad world
Oh yeah I bet. r/thathappened

Cesar Amesquita this particular video is not, but this has happened to many children
Is this girl real?!
Not this girl in particular but there are thousands of young girls like her, young boys, husbands and fathers that are separated from their family and mothers who are forced to leave their children.
Kxtelyn Rays no
This looks like it could be a movie. These videos have so much meaning
This is still sad :(
I watch the two videos and cried after 😖😭
The refugees and immigrants that a lot of time are rejected are just like her, trying to escape a dangerous place, only to be rejected by people who lives in a safer, better place because" Hm they're stealing our jobs ;/// "
Nooooooooooooo
war is the most terrible event in the world. yet everyone doesnt know that AMERICA is the root of all this war.
UnOfficiallyRekt neither is mine :/
Stella Loussier that's funny. you're not actually a girl in real life? if you are that's defianately not you in your profile picture
I just watched this today in school and it was heart braking
@H I G H Q U A L I T Y How sad, maybe I should get into the noose.
Your spelling is heart breaking
LRB productions same
at the end...those dark eyes....
she lost everything... i hope she finds her mum
(i know its an act)
Empathy...
When is the movie coming out?
tgrx85 never because it's not a movie this is an ad to show what is happening in Syria and Iraq(forgot how to spell)
That was so sad at the end you could tell exactly what she was thinking about, raping people.
This is so sad and I cried the whole time😞
When the little boy was talking away from her, I broke down crying!!!
titanic
hi everyone azerbaijanis
girl make a wish and  looking at the camera in telling  the truth girl is a girl but nice
Oh my this is so sad I also watched the first one too
she doesn't remember her parents 😭 I could never know what that's like 😢😭😭😭😭
this time there's a little boy too and she lost her mom (starts crying) this is way to sad like for the cause
people who thumbs down this video. . . they dont have a heart
1000+ dislike? i hate all 1000+ you that dislike THIS GIRL NEEDS A FREAKING HELP
@Mag A i know and idc XD
Diandra Fibonacci this girl is an actor.
Awesome...
where is it happening
that boy was the only one she had left why did they take him away I would not have let him go. I would keep him close to me and hold him so he couldn't leave. I mean I have a brother I would not have let him go......
Kiwi THEY DIDN'T FIND HIS FAMILY. The girl is not a selfish person, if they found his parents she would definitely let him go. They found A family, not HIS family. It means they found a selfish ass family that wants to adopt the cute little boy and not the preteen girl.
Because they found that kid's family and he would've been way safer with adults and not that one girl
Jess 101 He would be 100x safer with family though, sad but true
Wait, did they say Lilli Hannah?!??
make a third one pleaseeeee even though this is sooo sadddd
0:21 ??? Why the hell was he like pointing the gun at her then freakin touched her face and her grama came screaming????
Alexandra Rotari Called War😭
Does the date of the video represent anything?
Who else cried
Thats why I adopted a Vietnamese Kid!  They are preprogrammed and impervious to being stunned!!!
how are they filming this?
FunnyToast27 awn
Yea sure, this _is_ happening but many people here don't get that this is are actors
I don't care. this is happening in Syria
hmm... there is something called "acting" ☺
Damn. They should make a movie. Im dying for that.
if i could i would donate, but i my self am a child so i dont have much money of my own...
Sucks that people are so shitty that the only way people start caring is when they put a little English girl in the picture.
so sad😭
I started balling my eyes out when the little boy got taken off of her and she was like

"But he's all I have left"
My heart💔💔😭😓
Reese Casey don’t use stupid emojis
Reese Casey The feelings <\3
she has gone throgh alot : , (
This video made me shed a few tears considering my younger brother is her age.... T~T
That girl is an incredible actor! Simply amazing. But that's sad that that's happening now
still pretty sad
that sucks
THEY TOOK WAY HER ONLY FRIENDDDD
I hate the world why
This is horrible OMG I am crying 😭
Because the white people
Bombs are thrown by them
Poor immigration policy made her suffer
That's so sad. I think I'm going to cry! I have tears in my eyes!!!
please tell me this was exaggerated what can actually happen to anybody I just can't fathom
This girl is an example of what people are going through, some people are going through worse
That girl is lucky compared to some. She made it out.
-whydidiget30likes?????-
It's happening today.
At Syria.
There is a war there.
how do the girl is in a house if the girl before this is in the hospital? (im not english)
Does she lose her mom?
I really hate that the crisis has to be related to white, British people before us as a nation take any real interest. It should be enough that there are people suffering, we shouldn't need this to make us aware.
THIS NEEDS TO BE A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:40 is that a baby crying?????
that was a sad video :(
This is so sad i nearly cried in this
Barrykoala -  I DID CRY!
on 1:22 Are They Brother Or Sister Or Something Someone Respond Pls
Morgan Veitch ahh thanks i know im 9 months late i made a new account i was just checking
No, she found a little boy who has probably had his parents killed, so she's looking after him.
I really want a star wars one, but about some rebel kid and.. Some battles! Like endor,jakku,hoth,and some deathstar
Pray for that child she lost her whole family and made a new friend and took him away now she's all alone again and now she has to spend her birthday alone and no one want to do that u Need family and friends pray pray for her .
Oueen Alyssa this is all acted though
why?? if you watched the last one she had a great life and now there are bombs and guns to the head! why must this happen??!!!!!! WHY!!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭
i watched the first one and now im crying even more.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
lmao
Bouleversant
I didn't cry...... But it made me want to go and get the girl and bring her here :(
😥
ЖЕЕЕЕЕЕСТЬ!!!!!!
This is so sad
Still another day in Detroit.
A movie must be done about what hapening with syrian people
Uh I don't really know I was watching dank meme vines but this happend and I laughed a little :I
Random Name That's Depressed wow so edgy
You got a great sense of humor


Like honestly, what were you expecting? Cheering?
Random Name That's Depressed wow so war children suffering makes you laugh you have a horrible childhood
;-;
This is deep. That's all I have to say
Can someone tell me how realistic this ad is? I understand these issues are very real but my question is - this seems to be a very dramatic series of events... is this for shock value or is this a reality?
Hillsdale every day, sadly
@MutteringCondolences I meant current though. I am being really sincere - is this video closer to shock value? Or every day occurrence
Pick a war in history, any war, and this is pretty much dead on.
It's not exaggerate ! Try to find some real video of war in Syria you gonna be choked.. sometimes the volunteers doctors are filming their work to show the world 
The war is no limit and beyond horror..
for those of you asking if this happened to her,the answer is yes.
most kids these days care more about a phone then their own safety
OK?where is this "war" taking place.
Damn, this hit me straight through the heart...
I think she's Dafne Keen , the actress starring in the movie Logan
JJoanneful nope
I want a third!!! It's so inspiring!!
A third will probably come when it's over.
GottaBeKyla 
Sadly, in real life there is no happy ending..
Bluefire Yeah I want a happy ending 😭 When
That's why you should vote for trump
thing is now the uk is leaving the EU that will probably stop immigrants coming here which i think is just horrible
Brazil
Love this
This will happen when hillary gets elected
not sad
so sad her mother is probably dead and that little was the only thing she had left
These videos always make me cry
Im so scared. What if this happened to canada or America
stop its so sad
What do you guys think of  reacting and explaining to this video in detail on my channel???
Abdullah Al Jarad yes!
Good idea?
This really hits home, made me cry💔💔
0:06 that book is really good
Omg make one more, this is so sad, and i have cried in both of them!
Next time on the walking dead!
The girl is just acting right.Cause I don't want its happen to her.
Duyen  Ngoc Phan Le The knowledge of that makes this even more disturbing. This is an unbelievably powerful message.
But doesnt mean its not happening to other kids...
I really hope that she can find a good place to live after what happened. This is so sad but also so true. If you can read this comment, I hope that you get better and move on to a new live, which you can live happily.
Soon as I heard birthday.... ☠️
this needs to be a book and a movie
Can you they continue to make this?
Why are there only two of these!!! Make a movie out of this!!!!!
Aicha why its real life like it said its happening
I mean if they made a movie than lots more people whould see it and maybe some kind of better change.  but it's just on YouTube. there's lots of people who don't see this . it's more like spreading the news . . and yes it's sad .
If we allow lone children to come to western countries, guess where they end up?
Handed over to paedophile rings, I kid you not.
Since the Saville debacle and the Rotherham scandal brought nonce rings into the open, the establishment kiddy-fiddlers need fresh markets for their depravity.
Bringing young children from far-off lands, who no one knows, gives an opportunity for the filth to gain access to vunerable children, many who will simply 'disappear'.
ADD ANOTHER ONE BUT WHEN SHES GETTING OLD!
#SAVETHECHILDRED MATES
Attention: From an article from the Spanish Newspaper El Pais from 14.11.2016: This ONG is corrupt. In 2009 it got 5 million $ from Coca-Cola and from Pepsi. In 2009 Save the Children stopped to support the campaign for higher taxes on softdrinks with sugar. Perhaps the leaders of Save the Children also got money for the personal needs.
This was not real but some day it could be so all the haters should ashamed of themselves beacaus this could happen to you and one day it will.






Have a good day night or morning😔😔😔
r u dumb it's happening rn
it already has happened to many people
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I cried
I love these second a day vids❤️
I hope people are safe there God bless them all
This is so sad. She finds someone that lost there parents too and treats him like a brother and has someone, and then he's taken. I knows what this feels like to be reasposiblevfor a child but can't help it
so this is not real?
信伊斯蘭教的下場，咎由自取

drama drama and more drama
OMG!!! She has the same EXACT birthday as me. She is going through so much at so little.
⬛🔜■REMEMBER□■
SO SAD IM REALLY GOING TO CRY.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
She is a very good actor but other than that it's true these are our babies we need to protect them no child should experience this, and everyone that disliked this can burn in hell 😉
I'm pretty sure this is what happens after Trump wins. (Trump supporters are gonna come after me.) P.S. I'm Mexican
This is SO fake. How was she recording herself when she was passed out on the BEACH. Pretty sure if you are about to die you won't be recording yourself. What? That camera survived when she washed up on shore!? IN THE WATER!? This really angers me. Why would someone fake a video of such a serious issue. Do not donate to this.
U know what? Harry Potter is fake, too!! Did you know that, Sherlock?
Please tell me you're joking..
obv this is fake, this video was made to raise awareness of wat the children have to go through
The future of a child is gone. So sad. 😞😞😞
this looks like it would be a good movie. plz don't hate
can there be a part 3 where they all find eachother?? My tears are ducking crying 😭😭
😞😐
This is like the fifth wave
that girl's name I think she is 14 years old and say that their work and good if it is real: |
omg another one of her in it and again she looks at the camera at the very end :'(
Need more context.  I assume this is depicting Ukrainian refugees? The same ones that Germany turned away in favor of Syrians, etc? Where is YOUR empathy?
It's good that she takes care of that kid for this entire video
Is it actually happening all over England?
everyone should save kids now!
everyone should save kids now!
hi this really happened ?? it happened and very sad :(
UGHHH WHY AM I WATCHING THIS.
all this are true
This made me realize that other people are struggling more than me when I want Dan ;-;
Why did her parents not leave though 😩
The first one gave me chills but this one most definitely gave me the chills again.. Weird to say but great job on making these awareness videos.
this is unbelievably stupid why do we need to waste our resources on them when we have our own problems
Because the world isn't all about you?
I bet you liked your own comment
Thats called being selfish. If you were in the same situation as them then you would want help wouldnt you?
Because they have more problems then we do. Have a heart man.
you forgot the bit where she throws rocks at lorries and breaks into a trailer
It's good ♡.♡
Great story and all, and I feel sorry for kids who are forced to endure this on a daily basis, but doesn't England have enough refugees as it is?
thats d day what is going on dude
Thank you so much for these videos... people need to understand, it seems like they aren't touched by other people's suffering anymore... or should I say people who don't look like they do.
I live in Paris and everyday,  I take the subway and see Syrian families begging for money. It has become normal, they're part of the picture. But when people now just see beggars, the usual stain on their pretty environment, I see my own family, my neighbours... These people were ordinary citizens, living their lives, when the bombs that MY country threw on them forced them to flee and become refugees unwelcome everywhere they go... This situation is horrible, it makes me mad to see it just being accepted as something normal. These kind of videos should be what is needed to make people wake up but they will be sad for a second and go back to laughing at YouTube videos the next...
I agree 100%. I don’t see it happen in my area, but I do live in a small town. The worst part is I don’t know what to do to help...
it's so true! thank you sooo much for this amazing clip!!!
they took away the brother, 
"he is all I have left now" BUT IT WAS HER BDAY! PLZZ MAKE A PART 3
this is soo sad
how do i donate?
This video is heartbreaking without volume too
😐😐😐😕😕😕🙁☹️☹️😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😥😥😥😥😥😥😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭 I can't stop crying😭
Who's her name?

What do you mean this happens every day in countries like Iraq and Syria! This is not a video this is a girl's life :(
It's hard to imagine
WHY
wtf... please bring her parents back. 😢😭
wait are the videos real or are they put together to spread awareness
@Zach Griffith haha yeah it would be confusing
oh ok I was gonna say "who was recording her when she was the beach passed out
It's an ad. It's acting.
The last one I didn't cry. This one I did :(
Im litrally crying... my face is red...
That doesn't mean ur crying
This is so hard to watch
ZariBae same
I'm crying so hard
oh man, do we need to wait for another 2 years ?
damn. I would help that girl so much I would give her all my money and my phone. AND I WOULD NEVER DO THAT! weird.
Syria is in such a bad shape at this point, i dont understand why you would stay there
😨😨😰😰😰😪
shes  a good actor.
is this truw
This is so heart wrenching
Who is doing her one second a day they get some really good shoots
It's terrible that this life has become normal to some children... I hope one day war anger will end. If anything, it's just making the world even worse.
My name is Lily ... 1:42
lol cool story bro
kys
is this really
This is the reality.... the nerve of trump jr spoiled punk ass is calling refugees skittles... the only way for these self centered rich low life's that are self appointed judges.....are to be affected themselves....for them to feel true pain & suffer just as this little girl. I'll say it to his pathetic face my self.
He is the skittle that candy ass prince.
I feel so sorry for these kids it's so sad I really wanna show some awareness to these strong children across the country's with wars!!!😭😍😱😲
STUPID HATERS WHY CAN'T THEY LEAVE US ALONE
We need to save the children of America first before we save anybody else's. Forget other countries children is think about her own before we start mingling and other peoples business America take care of yourself and people.
😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤👏👏😭😭😭😭😭

I cried again 😭
I've always wished for a war to start where I live it sounds fun
it just sounds exciting
Wtf?!
😢why? why? WHY DO THESE THIS HAPPIN 😢 JUST MAKE THE WORLD BETTER  AND AND JUST VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON SHE'LL MAKE THE WORLD BETTER U WILL SEE 😢
no war!
You should make a stream and play Hearthstone
World War R.I.Perroni and cheese for this girl amirite.
jeez wtf did i just watched
How stupid do you have to be to ask something like that under a video simple like this.
I saw the Angel of the north I live near there
Hi guys, i hope u can take the time to read this
I am currently working in a refugee camp and honestly breaks my heart so see this on a daily basis, and I especially remember this one girl,she was about 3 or 4 and she was ecstatic, and I asked my interpreter to ask why, she said "because now ive got food that my baby brother can eat so he won't die, like he almost did on the journey here" I BAWLED eyes out, and I seriously was heartbroken, and I was hoping if everyone who comes across this comment, could either tweet DM or evn comment #SaveSyriasChilderen as a reply or anywhere where it would be made public, because this world is evolving, too fast for anyone to catch up , so hopefully this would really open up people's eyes to the world around them
Thank u for taking the time to read this, and I hope u r having an AMAZING day xx👍😘
Who is this little girl actress? She looks familiar.
She kinda looks like Dakota Fanning but she isn't.
Сука блять о боги скажите мне что это подстановка!!
who ever left a dislike is heartless
It's sad to know that eventually a war will break out and World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones
I cried so much
I love this video but its still sad 😇😢😢
I just want to know which war this is. Clearly this is Britain, so I'd say maybe civil war or Russian invasion, what do you think?
No actually it's supposed to represent Syria. But they're using British characters to say "Just because it isn't happening here, doesn't mean it isn't happening."
if the irish were going to attack them over potatoes they would have done it in 1847 during the famine
hmm..
Well, they must've been angry, the Potato Famine was pretty harsh
how could they invade without interference from France. Germany, Poland, Norway, Sweden, and finland? those damn potato farmers are the most likely 😂
Or it could just be a Russian invasion?
OMG did she lose her mom i couldnt see her??!!!
@Onloop Aw even more sad
Her mum got left behind when she got on the boat. There was only one space left and her mum made her take it.
this is really sad...but at least we have the same bday...
doctor : wat happens m8 girl : nothing m9 
doctor wat do you mean nothing girl: BRUH
اطفال سوريا يعانون من بشار وايران وروسيا
I'm crying
i cried during both videos
"We've found a family for Arfy"
"He's all I've got and I lost it..."
Cri :'(
"Today's your birthday,what does your parents give you?"
Cry more because she no longer has anyone to help her :"""""(
I Feel Like Im Dyeinnngggg
I'm from Swis
I got here from reaction time
This video hit me so hard. it would be great if this was turned into a movie with all the same actors. It would show everyone what it feels like when u r in this situation.
I hate why people do this. What did they ever do to you? We are all one and should be equal we live on the only plantet we KNOW of that we can live on. Why would people even think about doing this stuff to kids and adults and everyone? It sucks and all I could wish for is world peace so everyone is happy.
This is so sad. I wish you could make a video where she finds her family and lives happily. I know it wouldn't be so realistic, but this one just hit me hard. I couldn't hold it when she was separated from her mom. A happy ending would show people how allowing refugee families is the best thing you can do.
i don't think it's real
Elsina Esho it is in Syria there's a war
why would 1k people dislike!!!
:C
this hits hard
Did anyone see at 1:14 the reporter kicking the guy? reference anyone?
where is this?
😢😢😢😢😢
What's going on. What war is this
Yes because a child gets lost at sea every day. Most of these immigrants are military men and 99 percent of the refugees make it across safely. This is just shock value so you can give these people money
Last of us 2
"he's all I have left" and "can you tell me your parents names?" was heartbreaking
put more videos of second a day
This is war. It goes on everywhere. Doesn't matter if it's between 2 people, or 1,000. War is war. Don't bother wishing for world peace. It will never come to us.
Omg no... 😢
I wish all those ppl get a happy life ;(
I prey for them so much
i am cry, it so sad😢😢
😭😭😭😭
How do we even save them 





Why not ur company save them then making videos for people to save them but not able to
Omg these r so sad and the part where she said "he's all I've got left"made me cry
"save the children" 
OK, very interesting name for a charity who gave TONY BLAIR A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. you remember Mr Blair yeah?  you know, the mass murdering war criminal who was personally responsible for killing over HALF A MILLION IRAQI CHILDREN. so, save the children you may wish to consider changing your name to say.... I dunno errm... 
"war criminals" R" us "
another person making another trump remark on the video
ayyyy i have that book too, great book
great actress!
Extremely sad....
the subtle nod at 1:14 to the camera man tripping people over
I feel so bad I didn't even think about this before
why did they take him
away
OMG IM THIS THINKIN
G OF THE LAST OF US
makes me cryy
why did they have to make another one
hes all i got"Omg that part was sad im crying right now
:(im crying
#savethechildren
Et si nous  aussi , ou même notre fille était refugiée, aurions nous les m^mes réactions?
omg I'm Cr crying
It made me sad and I cryed
She is the best actress I have ever seen omg...
Omg
Those children and people are nice. Why do bad things happen to good people.
Stop making my little brother cry :-[
Well, she got on the boat without her.....

I'm sorry for that, I understand this is happening now. And it really is sad. I say, we don't let in the men, cos they shouldgo back, and fight for their country. Not fight against us.
brilliant
Oh, they made a sequel. Cool.
; ( i feel bad im crying pray for them
No this is bad life
Should be a movie
I'm praying for all the children that are going through this.
0:57 Zei die gast nou "Help me even?"
nou nou nederland to the rescue
What has the world become...
her mum at 0:14 : "No, I'm not hungry"
her at 1:16 : "No, I'm not hungry"
Still acting... Also pale people
She lost her family, her life, her friends, her home, her town/city, and everything!
Im crying right now :(
157 days?
BIITCH HOLD UP IN IN TEARS NIGGA LIKE THE PART WHERE SHE WAS LIKE " HES ALL I GOT " I LOST IT BOY
this makes me wanna scream and cry
Not nearly as good as the last one. Also, this one is particularly misleading. It's not helpless little girls flooding Europe. It's the strongest young men from a violent and aggressive culture. Take them in at your peril.
why would they take her poor little brother away!  😭😭😭😭😭😤😤😢😭😭😭😭😭😭
#prayfortheworld :'(
The 1k dislikes are the people who disagree with the horrible things happening around the world
😢
im sorry but ONE MILLION VIEWS AND ONLY 13200 LIKES ... AND WHY ARE THERE ANY DISLIKES. WHATS WRONG WITH KNOWING THE TRUTH!!!
OMG PLEASE SPARE ME MY TEARS STOP MAKING THESE VIDEOS ='(
I ALLWAYS cry when I see this video☹😭😞
I was in that situation 😭
DisTrict it's true!
Yeah sure! xD
Yeah sure! xD
+Saffron it's scary you would have to stay strong something my brother didn't do 😔
...a....a...a...💔
im sorry but how did they film all this?
iegoistas ambitious imbeciles mercenaries, diabolicos that are the QE mind, great kmo are believed other hitler mentally ill. and leaving QE, the devil take action and do QE, QE want them to believe they are the winners !! crazy disease.
A girl that goes to My school have Also been like that.. Not exaactily like that but..
there is something about this girl that if she was or she is in a movie i gotta watch it aand is he run for presidency ill vote for her now i gotta donate all my moneyy!!!
she**
Dam she my age
This is why war needs to stop. War is not okay just because we have always done it. When we look at animals killing other animals we call it cruel and barbaric, so why is it any different when we kill other humans just to get what we want. War is not the answer, but the world won't accept that fact.
sad it lookes a little fake though
it's an ad to raise awareness.
how old is this
I've seen the first video where rebel troops have overrun the entire country of England turning it into a full blown war zone and British military are trying to evacuate 60 million people out of the country but it's hard for them to protect their own people sometimes the rebels can look like civilians and then you have bandits who take what they want by force and CHILDREN are the future generations they should not have to go threw fear and surviving on their own
If she was a friend of mine or a cousin or.... something along those lines, as he was yelling as pointing the gun at her, I'd turn around look into his eyes and quietly say "let's put a smile on that face" 😂 and then from I go  he goes BOOM 💣
Im just so glad that my mom and i are a part of save the children beacuse now i see what all of these kids go through i almost cried😪
Ohhhh I get the video now they're refugees
this video to looks like world war 3 a large scale war in London
I'm so sad
Hey It's Pretty Much My Life What About Yours?
my gosh this is sad, it's terrible that people have to go threw this *slowly curls into a ball and cries*
oh god
the boat scene was so sad.. :(
The young girl is a great actor. Does anybody know her name or if she has been in anything else but this?
XD It's just acting.. How could they carry extremely high quality cameras around everywhere without getting them confiscated by the people? XD You gotta think
Disabler Your asuming that hes a pervert because hes impreased by her talent?
William  Stevens guys, stop getting mad, they never said the video wasn't sad they just wanted to actors name because this video isn't real, it's show what the real life events are like but this girl is an actor and it's actually a compliment to ask for her name so :/
+PrinceJGamer //MCPE When people say it's real, they usually mean that it is an actual event, not acted out, or at least based on a true story. At best this is "inspired" by true events. Not even based on a true story.

Real - What's on the screen is the filming of an actual event. e.g. CCTV footages, war photographs, footages in documentaries.

Based on a true story - Events that are shown on the screen are dramatization of the actual events that happened. The characters seen in the recording are actors representing real people that existed. e.g. historical movies, war films, biographical movies, etc

Inspired by true events - What's happening on screen maybe similar or parallel to what actually happened, but most of the story itself or the people are fabricated. Or the story itself is constructed on top of very limited accounts to provide a dramatic story. e.g. most romance films and novels, this, movies about alien abduction or big foot (based on flimsy and limited accounts of sightings), some movies about psychopathic serial killers that didn't actually exist but very similar people did, etc
1:13 what was that man doing?
what's most funny when at 1:14 girl says to men "GET OFF BIT*H" :i acctually cried all this video:
"Who else came from reaction time?"

Me: for fucks sake this vid is showing what's happening to many children right now.
The fact that she grew....
:'(
same
お母さんは…お母さんはどうなったの？泣
:(
True story in palestine & syria & Iraq 😢😔
A Little Advice: YOU COULD USE A BETTER THUMBNAIL like the previous one.This thumbnail doesn't bring an impact on first expression like the first video.
I am very sorry😢
so sad :(
This I sadder than the other one
Can you do a part 3?
I don't know why, but when the woman asked "Are you related?" And the girl anwered "No. I mean...´" It got me so badly. I don't know why, but it did.
I hate watching this😭😭😭
WAITING FOR PART 3
That girl is so beautiful, who is she?
я аж заплакала
I watched the first vídeo about this, with the same girl. Is soo sad, i want to create her in RPG's for the people see and see this video. Who is this girl?
When they got off the boat were they still is Syria ?
Eu invoco os brs para me dizerem se isso é um filme..  E se for qual o nome.. 
(Movie name? )
This is the reason we should probably take families in to are countries regardless of there refuges or immigrants because in a way we all are! Or we should send people who are willing to help and take care of the families that suffer! I think that may be the point of the video. So if your in the Untied States and believe my point please don't vote for fake behind Trump :)
She is beautiful...
#savesyria i just want it to stop. the whole world is just watching them perish...somebody help...what is the west doing? pls help.
oh man there is a follow up to the other one..oh man...... we need to save the children
Continue this
Genius
omg how are people that  mean to dislike the video
"he's the only one I got left" 😖😖
NOT AGIAN! THIS IS GONNA MAKE ME CRY
we need to stop bombing their country
I thought it was sad at first then I realized she was 10 days younger than me
am I the only one who is sobbing and having to hug there mom???:'(
does she say her birthday is the 3rd of may
I cannot acurately express how disgusted I am by all the hatred this is recieving. Would probably be the best if we just stop existing as a species.
So who attacked England?
I always do this when i watch these videos. Look at what she looks like in the beginning. Then look at what she looks like at the end... I always end up crying.😭
At the end (it's happening here) um I'm not getting shot at on the toilet...
Gotta love emotional manipulation.
Pure propaganda. They're all economic migrants
This ones worse then the 1 first
Im crying
How do you send the money

Clorox Bleach you guys are hilarious😂
the fricken sounds like chiken
Your comment made me hungry.
i gave 1212
This hit the feels man. god. shows the bad side of life.
Noo this is so sad.
I suggest you take it up with the Vatican, they are behind this afterall..
I was born in 2003 the same year as Lily/Lilly, but we were born on a different month but... We have the same name...Lily...if this is a true story I would want to meet her and say “I'm sorry what has been happening in your life but...I will never leave you..bc we are family now"
I think everyone has the right to live and have a happy life 
SaveTheChildren you are a amezing compeny in my school the teacher 
showed us the videos and i was hit in the heart becouse it is really sad
 to think about how much people die in these day i wich it was like when
 adam and eve where made and no one got hurt from animals and other 
people i wish i love all people i wish and hope they all have happy 
lives
This video is not getting enough attention
Almost all of the migrants who came to the West during the ongoing migration crisis were military aged men.
I cant stop crying
Powerful, that's the only word
thats it im crying now
the mom makes me cry
Can this be a movie please?
1:20
me
I can't breathe this id heart breaking.
Can someone explain to me what happens at 0:35 when the mum is with the man with the high-vis jacket on?
The mum is being told that only her child can board the boat and she has to stay
this mad me cry..and what happened there😭😭😭
Es tan deprimente, joder, malditas guerras, malditasss...... T.T
Why is it called "second a day video"?
It's so heartbreaking
every second in the video shows a different day in a refugees life
She has the exact same birthday as me
This the first vid that made me cry
This is so sad
This is so sad amen🙏🏽🙏🏽😢😢
LOL, this isn't propaganda, it's prophetic. This is Europe's future unless they change something soon.
omg :(
NO ONE CARES IF YOU CAME FROM REACTION TIME. GOD.
+Aliens Disguised As Hot Dogs Like if no one cares
Like if you came from reaction time
It seems that people will never have sympathy for the truths of what happens to children in the middle east. We're all to concerned with ourselves. Too egotistical to feel pain for the suffering of other human beings because we've been conditioned to fear them.
she is beautiful
In Norway its possible to be an refugee for 24 hours. You go trough the same things as shown in the video. Its done so that we can see how they have it.
This may be sad but war can happen at any time and keeping the citizens safe is important to keep the government running
When she stares at the camera in the end it sends chills down my spine ;-;
WARNING:COMMENTS WILL GIVE YOU CANCER
I think a lot of people are not really understanding the message of this video. This video shows what British people would go through if they were refugees, and to put people in their shoes.
wow I never thought I would see a vid like this...I just lost it
Sm *same in short*
Amen🙏🏽💙
she was reading more than this by patrick ness I love that book
thank you, i'll check it out
that's a great read.
+J. R. no of course not! just wanted to point out something light in such a dark sad video :(
Is that all you got out of this??
I cryed it hurts my hart
This could make a great movie.
it's so sad to see her change so drastically.  Her mother protected her at first, screaming "get off her" then she did it for the little boy. I don't know why, but when I watch this video (both the first and the sequel) it reminded me of Anne Frank a lot
at times i feel like i no longer care about what happens to other humans. when i cried watching this i knew part of me still cares about other humans
This is basically the UK after Brexit
😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😖😖😖😖😖
Make another one
Can you guys please make another one? I love this videos. They make me cry each time I watch them. And I love that people get to see probably how things works outside their own lives.
While we complain about $5 coffee...
i cri evry teim
She's born the same day as me well not the same year tho
They should make a movie for this
SO SAD #SAVECHILDREFUGEES
Ik this comment is absolutely irrelevant to the problem but when she said her birthday I felt like I almost had a heart attack because hers is one month after mine
i cried so hard...
😢
This little girl is so cute. I can't bare to see kids so innocent be put through trash like this.
+TheVincent37 *who she is
She looks like Dakota Fanning (If you know who is her)
TRASH aka war.
is that real
1:40 when she stares at the cam with these cold eyes...it just freezes your blood
I barely made it through the last one. This broke me
porque la guerra :(
omg i didnt know theres a another one
💔
This is good propaganda, reminds of socialist realism in back the good old days of the USSR but now it's called the UE
scared at war at all
and pls make a part 3
hate war I wish all countries are peaceful and happy ;(
This made me cry so much
اللي عربي لايك
i saw the first video too.This girl is becoming so so beautiful OMG
I cryed
What happened to her and where is she and is this based on a real event?
+Jake tongue yeah that's what I meant
+Miira Ducale to be more specific the girl is an actor and shows the hardships and the every day life of a syrian refugee eho has to flee the country because of the war while what happened to the girl personally isn't real all the scenes more or less have happened to most refugees
Yeah it's reall it's bean going on for 5 years in Syria
I. was. crying.   I'm. sorry. for the. girl
Apparently 1K people are heartless
NO IM CRYING
Iis that real
who is cuting oniones
make a part 3
i cried like never that was rude
I'm crying they have to make another maybe ther will be a happy ending 😭
You should make a movie out of this one and the other one
Her first video is just as bad as her second and this time she was separated from her family including her little brother. I hope things get better in her future birthdays. God help us all! :'(
She wanted to say yes they are related so they won't be separated
Why are people turning this into hate towards refugees? It's the exact opposite. This movement is to raise awareness for child refugees.
These ads are to make the situation more relatable. Seeing things in the news and on TV about strangers from other countries isn't going to really hit home, so they used the face of someone you can relate to- a white family.
normal people during this: i just wanna go home :(


Gamers: *grabs m4* this is where shooters come to life
if the british civil war outbrake, this is gonna real matter.
whos cutting onions
...... T-T
I feel for those who need help, I really do. But just like in Ethiopia in 1984,  the money we send could be going to the wrong places. Children like this little girl make me cry but the fact is, we can only stop the refugee crisis if we stop ISIS in Iraq and Syria itself.  You wouldn't wipe  up the water from the floor without turning the taps off, would you?
this breaks my heart. to see kids my age having to go through all that
im here from reaction time
Thats so sad im crying so bad and she is really beatiful and very pretty!
Oh this sucks.
Not kidding I'm in tears
Such a true and emotional story😭😭 Like if you agree👍Save The Children!!!!
there is no end to human horror
very sad to eat opiutngf group mokui mo lol poiup ps I eat food!!!!
THIS was actually shown during a screening of TMNT Out of the Shadows, not kidding
"I'm not hungry."
Reaction time sent me
Why did she say no when they asked if she was related to the boy?
I wonder what happened to her mom
yeah just a different hair colour
+random turtle me?
you look alot like the girl in the video
There should be a movie all about this I can picture a movie like this and about this....If you need any help making a video you can respond....This is just something i wanted to say
i hope they make a third one i love these vidoes
Can u make another video like this bc they are very interesting
Ok so UK was attacked and they escaped to France ok...LEGIT
That moment in 1:14 is a reference to that racist camerawoman, who was kicking syrian refugees fleeing over the border.
"refugees"
WHY THERE ARE DISLIKES IN THIS VIDEO?????
Dad was kept from her by a checkpoint, mum drowned in the storm, little brother was taken away, what could be left?
My house flooded i cried so much.🏡🚣🏻
make more of these its kind of like a awareness series almost
This real?
I CANT WAIT FOR WORLDWAR III
Ignorance. Ignorant people are coming.
I pray for them.Im I'm Canada and millions are helping refugees
She's reading More than This by p. Ness? I like her now.
part 3, 4 , 5 , 6... please its so sad but good and true
0:30 WHERE ARE MY GEORDIES AT
Okay so if we are bad guys with refugees why we accept them in our countries? 
That makes no sense.
I feel like this would make an amazing movie if they ever tried it.
oh my God this video has showed me how much people who lives in countries with war are sad and hungry and cold we all should help each other even if Arabic or not we are all humans right? we all have rights to live and eat
world peace✌
Well this is the UK's future. Thank Cameron. Lol going to enjoy beating up any anglo refugees in America.
this is so sad!
I'm so sorry I'm aculally crying
My 8th time watching....... I still cried
This is very sad and very impactful.  Great storyline.
this is the type of stuff our taxes need to go to.
it makes me wanna cry:-( :-( :-(
it made me cry😭😭😭😭
Time to gtfo of the EU
Merry christma- GET ON YOUR KNEES
they will eventually make another o of these of her getting a happier ending like the rufgess are supoosed to be getting
So sad cry everytime...
holy cow
"He's all I've got" I lost it
Now I can't even laugh

I know me too :(. This is the worst part of Syrian history
Randy do I
Randy do The girl: "He's all I've got let"
The woman:"We'll take him"
Just wow. Keep fighting for refugees.
what is life if we are surrounded by death?
I wish this would stop😤😭
Wars make man MAX
Anyone else here from Reaction Time?
omg and the women who make the man fall ??? 1:14  its all about syria omg

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 PRAY
I keep stopping and replaying so I can understand some scenes. Is that just me?
If this was a show it would make more more people understand what is happening in the world.
I wanna cry
Children are always the first and most tragic victims of wars of adults. :(
Will there be a third video? Because this is so sad
WATCH out it could happen
espero que ya estés em un lugar seguro
This is sad
I don´t now as people capable of dislike
this is actually happening. but no one cares. no one stands up. because is not paris.
what is her name ? pls
I cried so bad
"Today's happy birthday"...not so "happy" for her.
This is a very sad video I hope people around the world understand this situation.
She matured into a strong girl. I'm so heartbroken to see such a sad video.
That is so sad
i couldn't watch it until the end, i cried so much, DAMN I GET SCARED IF I LOSE MY MOM AT THE SUPERMARKET IF I LOST HER IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR HOW WOULD THAT FEEL??
This should be made into a movie it's such a good but heartbreaking story
what happened @ 1:10- 1:15?😞
they have 63 thousand subs
Wth.... Why... Omg I feel so sorry💔😡
What happened?
What is happening
OMG!!! I live in the USA and we get crazy crap, but this and plus we are probably started bombing innocent people, taking away their homes, why you might ask, oh just to feel powerful. We need to just stop doing all of this and no one will probably die or get injured by a bomb, I hate having these videos they are so sad and I can't bare to watch them, I live in the middle class and we do perfectly fine and just looking at this is the saddest thing children, I mean flipping children have to go thru this, and I'm complaining about not have a computer or something that doesn't even matter when I should be grateful I have a family, a roof over my head, and an iPad! WE NEED TO DONATE SOME MONEY!!
Around the world this is happening at this moment.. Be thankful for what u have.
WHAT IN THE ABSOLUTE HECK?!
This video is very thoughtful to think about they are poor and we are very lucky
@savethechildren this is on the news it is sad that children are separated from their parents
This is true? but first video is false
Nice joke that refugee looks like that XD

manipulation!
She's white, she's female, she's clever ( 0:07 book ), she has poor quality phone, she fears for her family. She's a total opposite of "refugees" flooding EU.
I didnt know that in syria and africa white ppl lives.
manipulation
Propaganda
Keep importing refugees to Europe and this is the future.
gg wp europe
So where are this children? ohh so they are white, how they did it?
Soviet propaganda level.
You suck Mega Mapper. If you don't care about Syrians then don't say anything. People like you should go to hell immediately. You should get your facts right. Syrians are white and you should freakin' go to Syria and realise their hardship.
RYB _CHANNEL Why only me? Everybody is starting a fight. And no, I prefer starting a fight.
Racism is when someone gets discriminated by because of the color of their skin. If I were to say that all white people were to only be aloud to go to certain schools or only be aloud to go to a terrible restaurant that only sold beef, that would be racism. How is that a good thing?!!
u idiot! This is just something to raise awareness of what is happening in syria! It is all an act.
MegaMapper however me being the "10 year old" shall maturely leave you to your own devices. You can sit there sticking your fingers up at people because of their differences but just remember it'll bite. Bye Bye won't comment to the intolerant anymore
Goebbels would cry out of pride.
U are idiots...
hahaaahah we almost believed in that propaganda ;D
White redhead girl without hijab or whatever this thing is called, Sure IMIGRANT (not refugee, they are no refugees in europe from siria)
How the hell this vid has 8.5k likes...Are people that much stupid to believe in this manipulation ?
bullshit...
Chujowe, pozdrawiam.
manipulation
yo western Europe, you still buying this ?
Propaganda....
Why your video didn't show adult and aggressive men that are the majority in the group illegally coming to Europe??
+profjb58 Well said.
Well i'm pretty sure it did show aggressive men anyway at 1:13. Oh wait that's the representation of our border patrol.
Yes, some men might be agressive but would you like it if your homeland,your job, you whole life got taken away?
Many of the refugees are male yes, but I don't think you should say they are aggressive as an overstatement. It may be true that some of the men are aggressive, but it's not right to generalize and say all men going to Europe are that way. Also, this organization is trying to bring the suffering children to attention.
manipulation...
manipulation
Make another one please!
fuckin manipulation 90%Refugees this fuckin men  soldiers  not children
Thank you for showing what Europe will be like if they continue to let the refugees in.
Idiots!
95% of them are young men in age betwen 16-35. Wake up fools and dontt believe this propaganda. Check it yourself.
xD
its horrible whats happening, and how after all that pain they've been through people are still mean to them. I got even more upset when I found out her birthday is a week after mine (9th june 2003)
MANIPULATION!!! It's all about welfare. Why they don't "escape" to countries where they'd have to work. The beter the welfare the more "refugees". Interesting coincidence.
You're a genius m8. can i seuck yao paynis?
Fot thousands of years people do it the same way.  They work and take care of children at the same time.
THIS VID IS A LIE!
please show real imigrants - well feded faties with iphones and ipads that are comeing to europe to take grants witohut any work
Manipulation in its best way. Most of these immigrants are young men who saw no poverty.
Oh you dumb sheeps, spare all the quasi-open-minded speeches. You are supporting cancer that lead its country into chaos and now it simply switches the host. I'm positive through, nationalist groups are progressivly raising in terms of popularity and will sooner or later stand against the suicidal politics of *spits* European Union.
change the title to how to munipulate black mass.
manipulation
manipulation
CHECKPOINT!

AYY SUKA
all lies in one movie.
bullshit
What a beautiful propaganda... And stupid people believe in that crap... Lot of REAL videos shows completely different things...
Paweł Piotrowski wtf are you talking about?
Remember that 90 % of the refugees come from Turkey .. manipulation should be punishable !
Hahahaha. What a manipulation
about 90%  of this "refugees" is men in age 16-30 so this movie is one big manipulation.
manipulation
and propaganda continues...
I'm so thankful that no one I know is in that situation including me. I feel terrible for refugee children going through that🙏
still fucken funny
men able to carry arms are not refugees, men fleeing from defense of their own country are simply cowards.
And The Kurds? The SAA? 
But be a coward is an easy and simple way.
ISIS has training (self trained), weapons(Thanks to the US, UK, and some allies), food, medical supplies and shelter.
+Tomek z Polski so not really sure what you're getting at.
@Tomek z Polski I have no qualms with letting refugees in, I think countries should take their fair share.
Ale Lewackie kurwy ja pierdole xD
albo wted
@Zdzichu Rączka Ukryta opcja polska.... xD
To jest śmieszne nawet trochę - przejżyj sobie komentarze pod filmem, prawie wszyscy po angielsku piszą, ale jak byś się spytał to utajnieni polacy :> .
@Zdzichu Rączka xD
O sorry, tekst pisany nie ma akcentu, można się pomylić :> .
:) yeah right :)
anyone else heard help me in dutch at 0:57 ?
I cried
The amount of ignorance in these comments is so sad. You have got to understand that "no one puts their children in a boat
unless the water is safer than the land". This is not, as some here say, what will happen if some refugees are taken in. This is what will happen if so many people loose their humanity and compassion.Also: saying that it's always about Syria... A) it's not, it's about refugees in general B) Would you go to a fundraiser for cancer research and shout that there are other diseases, too?
Keep importing refugees to Europe and this is the future.
So in your opinion its ok to take refugees from britain but if you take refugees from syria it'll destroy everything?
General Swiss SEE thats the godamn problem. You have the innocents and the evil. You cant filter out the bad guys and the innocent. So were stuck at this point. We can help the people but also let the bad ones come in and destroy the country or you can just leave them for them selves and i dont know most likely mass deaths in the middle east. We wanna let them in but the bad ones come along and we cant stop thdm. That slowly changes our mind to this point. To superpowers just dont know what to do. P.S. my mom and dad immigrated like 35 years ago. They are not syrian. Ones Iraqi ones palestinian so im not syrian.
Well I was trying to be polite, but since you asked I'll remind you that their women blow themselves up too. So their women can stay and fight their own war too.
@toopercentmlk you call students from universities, doctors, scientists, "able-bodied military age men" but women of the same age and background are fine?
It's definitely refreshing to see sexism aimed towards men rather than women, but it's still pretty damn shite boyo.
Emma Rainbow The point is strongly made, and I'm sure he didn't miss it. The problem is that this is a heavily biased representation of "the other perspective." This is just a mother and daughter, and the vast majority of the world wouldn't mind taking them in regardless of race or origin. The issue is with able-bodied, military aged men, from a country who's culture is ingrained with hate towards the West. This is very dangerous for the host countries of Europe, and as we can see there are already problems arising from it. 
Shelter and care for the women, children, elderly, but as an able-bodied man who has stepped up to defend my own country, they need to stay and fight for theirs. The US Congress would likely vote to give them military aid anyway.
Interesting that the video is about children when the vast majority coming into Europe are men under 40.. And then there is the implication that this can happen in Europe. Which it absolutely can, and will sooner then anyone thinks, and that means we will be refugees ourselves but there will be nowhere to run too. Europe is the last stop and if we loose it there will be nowhere for us to go. We only have the choice of fighting or dying, no one will help us.
I hate when there's wars😞 and other things
I hate when there's wars😞
omg im crying so hard i cant believe what im seeing 😭 donating money and food now
This is so awful😭
😱😨😰😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Make more plz
Please Make the other one
this is the most sad video I have ever seen :'( I'm crying even tho I came from reaction time D':
Thank you for making this.I cried during the first one, and I cried during this one. I do not have a lot of money myself, but I will be donating at least some to you. Please help them.
Hello @Vilja - thank you so much for watching and commenting - I had the same reaction as you when watching both these videos. That is also great to hear you plan on donating, thank you so much. Laura
Where is this and its not in serbia because my aunt is in serbia and its not happening
What cruel person would dislike this
seriously who could ever dislike?
I'm Crying! 😥 ...
pleas make more of these
OH MY GAWD
yet more emotional blackmail!
What country is dis happening in
+Noha Omar oh
Syria
So sad
Open borders for Israel.
how they film this?
Any videos for the white refugees in Ukraine and South Africa? Nope? Okay.
Triggered?
why are white people like that?
how many videos do you expect? stop being a whiny bitch
you're dealing with a white supremacist-oops I mean a "Race Realist" like Enoch who injects himself into things like this because he needs a platform
And how does Britain go from being a peaceful, orderly country to a war-torn hellhole so quickly? What possible volatile element could be added to a society to cause such a collapse? I think we all know the answer to that one, not that you're allowed to say any more.
It’s happened before in WWII to many European countries
Watch the iconoclast
Rabbi Merchant Shlomo Goldberg-Shekelstien oy vey
It's alright guys, I think he means zombies
THIS IS A WARNING 

THIS WILL HAPPEN TO EUROPE
Yeah if we let them all in unfiltered
Soon.. it will happen to America
@yamin ahmed
Yes I know. My point was most people will just believe them. Those that question are the minority. And according to the government, those people should not be believed. That's where the term "conspiracy theorist" came from.
This reminds me about an inspiring book I read called boy overboard by morris gleitzman.
Really?  They added that news reporter happening at 0:14? I really hate how the world and mankind is today, but I wonder... All this attention and giving some refugees more rights and freedom than their own people in some countries, is honestly ridiculous! Most countries have poor and homeless people themselfs. People who fought for their country. Suddenly money is well to spent while the less fortunate suffered for YEARS.. Imagine society how it is now, and then imagine we getting in their situation.. Will we get the same help and freedom in THEIR country? I consider that a relatively small chance.
Thank you for showing what Europe will be like if they continue to let the refugees in.
You are missing the point. The video wants to express the opposite.
So is that a warning?
Or are you making a promise?
Use Adblock you are heartless
The Angel of The North. Any fellow Geordies ??
Most people don't care because they think it only happens to other people, everyone lives with the impression that something like this can't happen to them.
still left to cover: when she is trafficked and subjected to child prostitution, forced begging or used for her organs. Like 10,000 children who have disappeared from Europe.
Who is here for reaction time
i counted the candles on the first video and the first birthday and there were 8 then and the end of that vid she turned 9 then there was one in this vid so i guess she s 10 now
im really sorry of them.... my hope that it will be finish soon
just getting to syria to solve this mess
that poor little girl
I saved a Baby Before,I adopted it. I'm 29
When people complain about there lives please search this up..... Sorry im just about to cry
Make a part 3 plz it's so sad
Wow. And I thought some of the bad luck I have had in my life was.....well......bad😔
'Its happening now' 'Stop paying tax' 'Stop being a part of the same system which allows it to continue'
My reaction when seeing this: "Oh, no! They made another one!" *grabs tissue box*
Seems like she ended up being in Germany. Like so many others, who can not even have privacy anymore. It's sure better than living in a war, but still not a good life. I guess we should all appreciate that we are free and don't have to live in a war (yet) and  try to help people in need as best as we can, to make their lives a little happier again, don't always be too afraid of let go of some of your wealth. If you would be on the other side you would want people to help you and be understanding and nice.
Respect
So sad I was crying
We all need to stop the suffering.
Who is this girl
The living conditions in the beginning of the video reminds me of Indian Reservations in South Dakota.
Please make a 3rd one soon
can you make the next part it is great
😢😭💔 This Is Terrible!
My heartaches for these families.
My problems are nothing compared to this :(
Watching this has shown me how grateful I should be that I am so privileged to live such a good life compared to the refugees who go through this everyday to get to a point they feel safe enough. I want to help, I want to do something for them life is unfair for them and they don't deserve the destruction in life they're receiving. We, the privileged ones, the ones who CAN help, we need to speak for them. Those who have no voices. We need to help.
More than 60.000 children from the middle east arrived in Germany since September 2015 and now everyone hates us because we try to help them. This is how cold-hearted and xenophobic Europe has become.
Why should Europe not be for Europeans?
wow.its that girl from that last video ...
0:52 you hear in dutch het zijn kinderen ,help me even (they are childeren , please help me)
wheres le mum
Vilains, vilains français.

Humanity need to prove that we care about our fellow human beings, 
no matter the culture, language, politics, gender, etc.
We must try to make a better world.
Lets help.
is it real??!!!😞
I never thought about it that way. That's really happening to real people. Wow
+LovelyLucy02 Yeap... And that was it among few hundred thousand of refugees that came to Europe. That's totally legit to allow half a million men enter the country for about 8 hundred women and children.
I completely respect your opinion but one of my good friends has seen a camp in Calais and she saw those women and children for herself!
What evidence do you have that it's propaganda?
I came here from reaction time
they are 56 countries in wich Islam is the offcial religion , why they want to go to Europe ? Europe is facing huge problems and also poverty.
If we let this migrants in we shall have a Yugoslavia War 2.0 , this video is what could happen to you if you let unknown people in to your country
"it will happen if we let unknowns into our country"

shit...I'm never going abroad on holiday again.
Make another one
i know i'm going to take a lot of hate for this but a video like this makes me mad not because of the story but because it doesn't represent the majority of immigrants i would be fine if the majority were like this but their not most of them just want to make more money and try to escape poverty and as a result they are pouring in to Europe by the hundreds of thousands and even millions, and as a result many of them cant find housing causing the cost of housing to skyrocket also the unemployment rate has gone way up along with the crime rate and they are displacing hundreds of thousands of native Europeans that were their before them and are starting to make an impact on their economy
Does she not remember her moms number?
The phone was in the water when the boat she was on capsized and therefore failed to turn on.
Please say this is not fake 😔😔
I can't believe some people disliked this video 💞
Stupid video, stupid propaganda!
YellowGreenHearts and F.U.C.K Y.O.U lol just kidding but u shouldn't call it stupid because what happen if this happened to u
0:06 Good book, that.
What is the name of the girl in this video?
Her name is lily aslanogdu, she has a YouTube channel and snapchat
@Arta T. I'm not sure. Maybe you could use IMDB?

I love this video and u learn a lot could u do another one

We about to take 3 Syrian boys (16, 18 and 19 yo) to live with us. My wife's daughter is really excited about it :)
Can I ask how it went? I can't imagine how challenging that must be.
@***** 
lol they are already here and everything is just fine
@yamin ahmed
You know the OP comment is a joke, right?
I don't see children between them. In reality, so called refugees are 99% young men. Don't be fools.
Because they arent allowed to work if they are "Asylanten". dont know the english word tbh
I like how the number fluctuates so much. First it was 80%, now it's 99%. If you're going to lie to us, be consistent about it.
You have to go back

i feel so sad for all of them! this should not be happening
Vidéo horriblement réaliste... Terrifiante à la fois sur le sort des réfugier, et sur le fait que cela peut a tout moment nous arriver... (Ou nous ré-arriver si on prend en compte que ce c'est déjà passer il y a 75 ans...) 

Terrifying Video horribly realistic ... both on the plight of refugees, and of the fact that this can happen at any time us ... (Or we re-occur if one takes into account that this happened  75 years ago ...)
Don't mind me just over here crying my eyes out whining like crazy
I hope that kids around the world are save and well fed.
They're not.
No, I mean they are not. Like the children are not safe and well fed. You can hope, but its not true. You can hope that it will be true, but they would rather that you help it be true rather than just hope for it. Donate to good charities, volunteer, help your hope become real.
Yes I do too
How could somebody dislike this..
@yamin ahmed
Nope. They seek a place when they cane live on our expense. This is one of the reasons that they will never assimilate. When you live for free with no need of work for your living it demoralises you. Especially as they hate europeans already.
Who came here from reaction time btw this is super sad i don't like what's happening
I feel so sad that its happening right now 😣
Thanks to America and Europe's foreign policy this is soon to be a reality in the 1st world as well..

M. Night Shyamalan needs to direct the next one, the twist is: all the "children" are men in there 20's.
This is really touching.I hate to see people suffer...I would help them if i could! :(
Awesome video. Made me cry. I'm gonna go show my parents.
Well today is 16th may so happy birthdayy!!
@yamin ahmed her she said it in the ending 
I'm fine until the end damn it gets me every time 😭
Same here it's always the ending !!!
WAIT IS THE LITTLE BOY HER BROTHER OR JUST A FRIEND HELP I CANT SLEEP IM SO SAD I NEED REPLIES
a fellow refugee she is taking care of. a friend who is like a brother.
+meowcaroni It seems like he's not her brother, but she treats him as one. She says to the doctor "His parents drowned".
Don't feed the Brits. They spread disease easily, will drink all your liquor, and still think the spice girls are legitimate act.
+yamin ahmed trust me the spice girls died in the early 2000s

We don't drink anymore than most countries

no matter what disease we are one of the lesser infected countries
It's the end when the girl says, "he's all I got left." That hits me
This gave me goosebumps... 😕😕😕😕😕 poor families
This video was so heartbreaking.  It's terrible how many hardships some children have to go through.  And it's scary to think that my little sister is that girls age..
"He's all I have left"😭😭
It's sad 
Whether it's Syria , Iraq , Palestine or Yemen . people cannot relate to the things refugees go through in their lives because they don't look/dress/talk like them according to them they are both humans but they don't matter .
Why did the second video come out two years later?
+Dr Lies It honestly just shows that the Syrian Crisis is still going, and we should keep paying attention to it.
What's the girl's name?
Oh thanks!

should I like or dislike this video becuase I dont like what happeneds in the video but I like that someone made this video

I came here because of Reaction Time, i have seen the first video made with this girl and i just want to say that i am happy that there are still people out there trying to raise awareness... I myself am from Greece and i know what refugees have to get through daily just to continue being alive. I just hope this video achieves his prime ambition and raise the awareness needed for those people... Cause we are all the same
And my heart is irreparably broken from this. :(
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Make a 3. Keep up with the good work. Sorry for my bad english😉
Very sad video! 😭
Every time I cry...Every time
Does anyone have the name of the actress?
And I thought going to school everyday is stressful I'm 12 btw
Make number 3
This made me cry so did part one ):
This is an incredible video that is just a minute but has a longer story
is this a real life?
Well, the video is acting, but this thing is actually happening in the world.
Dude like I started crying, I feel so bad for those children and whoever disliked this video has no heart
@Cynic And did you ever have to watch these people go into Europe? There were more children and women than men that were coming into Europe. Don't be thinking all of them are rapists, yes some of them have raped other people but you have to judge the person not the entire group.
+Phanic_at_the_black_parade_with_crybaby the first part was hilarious but btw I live in America and I'm one of those who believes this and wishes no one had to be this way
+Phanic_at_the_black_parade_with_crybaby LMAO
Great video. I just made a donation.
Bless you Ma'am. if even 10% of people did this the issue would be progressing to a solution.
this would be an amazing movie I've never in my entire life seen something like this for this has changed a lot too me
To see the awareness caused by little things gives me hope that the world isn't so small after all.

Thank you for making this video as this has gotten me straight in my heart and realized how our world needs to be saved from the society we live in.

I appreciate this video. And the effort into it.
Absolute acting. Staged and paid for event. Bullshit.
this is so sad but still so amazing I really hope they continue to make shocking second second a day video to make more people aware. 💞
Plese make another one
i srlsy whine about the little things going on in my house.like no internet no goof food or no good medicine but when i saw this video,i never whined about a lot of things any more.i apreciate things that i have(srry for bad spelling.i know i suck)
Thank you mom and dad for loving 
me not ever letting me go...
I love y'all so so much as well as my brothers...
Thank you God for everything...
Even for my weird brothers...
Love what you got guys..
Because next thing you know
Poof! There gone........
Aww fell so bad I new stuff like this is happening but it's so sad it's sad because she found a friend then he got token away
Thank you for raising awareness to  the terrible situation in Syria, I am truly grateful
Esto es demasiado triste :c
I cried when her friend got taken away from her
This is an amazingly powerful video. They should show these in classrooms worldwide. It hurts to think that this is going on around the world while others just sit back and do nothing. My heart goes out to all children, men, and women who just want to see their families and be safe <3
k bye guys I'm gonna go live with aliens, worst planet ever!!!
came here from reaction time
Is this a true story about her? If so what is her name
Wait can someone clear this up, the mom couldn't get on the boat with her, she lost her parents, and then when the siblings go to the refugee camp thing, her brother gets taken away form her? Why couldn't they stay together?
+gluetubed oh if she said that they were related, they could have stayed together...
That wasn't her brother just a kid who was on the boat with her...
This touched me in the heart just think of all the money and items we have and look at what them people have they have nothing....
i cry everytimeee
honestly they should make more of these. this poor little girl had a life with a family but it was all ripped away in what seemed like an instant
of course it is habibi.
at the end of the video i can stop looking in too her big blue eyes and felling guilty that she there and i'm on my bed looking at this when there  other  people who live the same thing
me too ! :(

Now I'm thinking about Donald trump and he's idea about that wall...
She reminds me of Ellie from The Last of Us. But this really sad either way. Thanks for raising awareness.
Oh my god these kids have such a hard life can you even think in like in 4 years your at home celebrating your birthday then after about four years your at the camp and some stranger only the stranger saying happy birthday with nothing no one just you.
I'm probably only 4 years or so older than this girl and I just wanna help but 'children' these days can't do anything else than sit in there rooms and watch what else is happening in the world without experiencing it. I cried too much😖😭
This video doesn't reflect miserable everyday reality of refugees at european borders. This girl doesn't have new iPhone 6s and  she doesn't wear any Armani clothes. Her mother doesn't have her face hooded and she didn't even throw stones on police officers! And she suspiciously eat given food greatfully instead of throwing out of a tent because it's not halal. This clip is fake and fictional. Kappa.
Why thumbs down tho?
0:55 NEDERLAAAAANNDDDD
I am showing this video to my school. This video is so powerful
They should make a movie about this
I believe so too. Both first and current videos, in your context, would have been trailers.
This is so sad
British refugees wouldn't be oppressed because they do not carry the beliefs of the Middle East
It's not happening there.... It's happening here in Greece.. thousands of kids from Syria, saved from war, are trapped here because of the closed boarders and some of them starting to die because of the poor conditions... and where are you? You want the country with worst economy in Europe, that pays annually billions in fellow European countries to save all of them?  Also I hate the fact that the kid in the add is from EU. Yeah don't put a "brown" kid, it won't make an impact...
+EonTheReal Actually a lot of Syrian children are white or just have lighter skin complexions. Plus it would be cruel if they tried to have a real Syrian refugee act in this video and relive those horrible times. I think it had an amazing representation on their struggle and we should all help them all no matter their skin color
I can't believe we are living in this kind of world its just depressing
Pray for peace fam❤️
No human deserves to go through this😿
This is such a well made video it really gets to you, and makes you realise what's going on in the world best advert ever they should make another one.
This makes me feel so weak and unhelpful knowing I can't do anything about it

in the last video there is one short sence where she is funny and calls for her dad who is locked behind her behind a fence and then in this video there is a point where she and her mom are hanging fliers. I paused the video bc I was curious of what it said, now I miss I hadn't on the fliers it says missing dad and husband. that is the part that brought me to tears.

Suddenly, my problems are hangnail important compared to this.
For  me islamisation of Europ is worst that this. And this is lying propaganda by the way, refugees are completely safe in Turkey. There is no fuckin see between Turkay and Syria. They are illegally swimming to Europe and dying on the see just for free money!!! And 90% of man 25-35yrs old. Sometimes someone is sending kids, like this little boy found dead on the beach, who's father wanted new teeth.

😂😂😂same
como de fiende a su amigo
que vonita es la nina pero vive en otro pais
This is so sad if I had money I would donate all I could
What I really don't understand is why there are so many dislikes I mean wtf !!!
When it hits you that shes the same exact age as you.
 Kids my age where I live sit here an act like their life is horrid for such minor things. (I get serious situations but i'm talking about minor). Like you sit an pout when you have a mum or dad or caregiver taking care of you, food on your plate, clothes to wear and a roof over your head. And the thing is that don't take a freaking minute to sit and think about other people because they don't want to hear about who has it worse. they would rather just drown in their pity.
The second part 😱😱
First they toke her dad away then her mom and now her only friend, I've never felt so sad over a video in my whole life. Then when I realized this is happening right now it makers me think "We need to do a change to this world"
Make a part 3...!!!
Who is also here from Reaction Time?
Me
Zainab Hadi meh
+jojo woody i know right im in the comments to get get some moodah omg
If you disliked this video you have no heart.
I actually cried so much
E
I don't know what to say...
This is so inspirational, keep making videos like this, it's not changing the world but it's raising so much awareness
is it weird that I have the same phone as her
I don't think that the mobile belongs to her. Maybe it's from one of the volunteers so she could try to call her mom.
+Its Madster yeah its a Samsung note 3
I do too
Wow
I remember the first video this is just sad
This is so sad it makes me want to cry
Who else came here from Reaction Time? still the best :( but always made me cry :'(
16th of May that's my bday yassss
+Ceira Mortimer happy early birth day!
i am crying
same, this is one of the saddest videos I've watched
I use to talk my life for granted and never say I love you but know that has all changed! I love my family and I tell them that everyday! I Love my Mom!
#save the children
This is such an emotional video even though the video is fake all that stuff happens to some kids! They need a save and secure home!

Thank you Save The Kids for making these videos!
this is so terrible. I'm so thankful for what I have. not many realize that what they have is truly amazing. and they don't think about what's going in somewhere else. thus is such a sad video but it is a great way to raise awareness. 💙
Everyone should see this. Cause people are really living their life this way and it makes me so sad.
She's my age 
OMG
Reaction time?
Yep
Yep😂
yup
Not saying that I wouldn't help or anything but I feel like a majority of these charities spend the money on the company itself like expanding offices or it goes to the workers paycheck and the very little money that's left (if any) actually goes to what the charity is stating its going to. In example, the Red Cross foundation. If a person doesn't state in the check, for the money to be donated to a specific crises,  than that check goes to renovating more offices or luxury items that are not important. Not saying they don't help out at  all but they don't help as much as they say they do or as much as they can help. Most of our money that we give to these charities actually don't go to the crisis. If all our money was actually going to where it is supposed to be going to, there would be a big difference. Do some research, you'd be surprised with the information you find and what charities are actually real.
so sad
this video has made me so thankful for everything
Imagining a my daughter leaving the states (under these conditions) and going to Saudi Arabia and wondering how she would get treated.
Reaction time bought me here. Who else???
Now this is why we need to turn the refugees away, we don't want Europe to end up like this,
@P..._...P​ K good because tge children really really need our help and support to be able to live happy, healthy and safe life's! 
+Brooklyn Young Most of the 'refugees' (who totally are not economic migrants) are adult males who should be able to fight for their county.
The Children yes we should help.
@Brooklyn Young ikr
YOU ARE HEART LESS!  THOSE KIDS NEED OUR HELP!
You sound uneducated this is what happens to people in the middle east everyday except they all die its really sad. why do you think they come as refuges to get away from the terriost an the evil people they want to be safe.
it was really sad😢
who came from reaction time ?🙋🙌🙌
yup
Me
✋
this makes me so sad i never cry and i almost cried when i was this video
sugasfault army 

The world is very corrupted these days... I hope that the goodness of the people in the world could make a large different soon...
sugasfault army  it gets worse...she dies.
Omg this was so sad!I FEEL THAT I WANT TO CRY!🤒😵😱😭😪😖😥😪
Who else is here because of Tal aka reactiontime
Me ✋

Upload in my 21st birthday; never a good omen
These videos 😪
This breaks my heart 😖💔
If the refugees are christians or jewish and 50% male/female ratio, they are more than welcome in my country. Buddhism and Hinduism are a good match for my country too.
I keep reading accusatory comments of people labelling this as being propaganda...

Propaganda for what? Justice? Perspective? Truth? What's the hidden agenda? Ya'll even know what propaganda is?

Cognitive dissonance at its finest.
+Raph Dae How it is cognitive dissonance to see this as propaganda (which it is)? It seems you don't know what CD means. Maybe you don't even understand what propaganda means. Oh, ignorance is bliss.
Yeah, multiculture is doing great in Sweden.
it is more like what will happen if we keep taking refuges
Great video. Happy to see people who understand the situation.
+putdub gamer keep it in the family
+SaveTheChildren  I understand that people are having a difficult time I didn't know that before but now I know everyone needs to appreciate  everything that they get!!!!!!
+SaveTheChildren today we have advance technology i would love to trade places with her or any other kid in a situacion like that
Thank you for watching +Ultra Silver - Laura
In 1955 there were 2.5 billion people in the world, today 2016 : 7.5 billion (!). Refugee crisis? No it is the  population bomb and it will get worse and worse and worse.
the only Solution for all problems (especially third world) is called: birth control!
is it movie tell me what is it name of the movie
wow.. the expression of her face.. perfect
jajajjajjajajaja Siempre manipulando con imagen de tristeza y esas mierdas....
most refugees are not even Syrian, they're just economic migrants taking advantage from the Syrian crisis. shame that the real people that need help are the ones left behind
Its going to happen world wide....
What a pity read comments like "Europe 2017", when your continent it was made with slavery and murder of all the others. If you have at least a little bit of humanity open your doors to those who built your castles.
Yes, we don't have humanity because of what our ancestors did years ago.
I don't care for this emotionally manipulative propaganda.

I'm all for saving children, but the face if the matter is most of the refugees need to be sent back from where they came from.
I like most people have no problem accepting families,women and children refugees in my country, but the males with no professional skills and all the religious extremists need to stay away and sort their own country out.
Maybe if 80% college aged men that are fleeing their own country and are to coward to fight for their own nation this wouldn't be a problem.
I love that people from my school were in this video !
she's cute
You should know that certain platforms are antagonizing people against your campaign by using it for click bait with headlines claiming that the girl is filming herself in her real life. Peoples' compassion goes poof when they learn they're being lied to. However real those scenes may be for many children, the footage isn't and hence the headlines are inappropriate and vexing to many who may otherwise be inclined to help.
I am deeply saddened and shocked at the amount of people who mistake the purpose of this commercial as "propaganda," and make comments about "this will happen to us if you let them in." And even more shocked at the amount of people that actually LIKE the comments. The lack of compassion for those who do go through this is very concerning. And yes, it's supposed to be emotionally driven, because it gets your attention, but for a good purpose. This is simply to help Save the Children...it's their freaking slogan! Stop being so damn emotionless and ignorant, people! This is REAL. It's not made up. What would you know, if you haven't ever gone through something like this? Step into their lives for a moment. We are all so privileged to have what we have, be it a little or a lot, that we don't realize there are others worse off, and take for granted what we are  blessed with. Stop with the nonsense comments.
she looks like a protagonist from a series like the walking dead or something, if she gonna play in a series like that i'll be the first one who'll watch xD
Those of you who keep saying that most of the migrants coming to Europe are young men, you're missing the point. Obviously.
+Taeyeon Kang (Cream) I very much agree that children should be helped. I hope you understand that when all the resources are wasted to support these economic migrant men, all the focus is there, there isn't room anymore for helping those who really need help.
+Dfective11 let's leave numbers aside if that's your problem. Even if children and women were only 0.01% of the migrants this video would still make sense since they need to be helped.
+Taeyeon Kang (Cream) "other 20% of the migrants" are you suggesting that 20% of them are women and children? I hope you are aware that many young men lie their age to get easier access to Europe. In reality something +90% out of these economic migrants are men. Some very small portion of them are actual war refugees, but they turn to be economic migrants also the second they move from one safe country to another.
+Dfective11 the fact that this video is made for the other 20% of the migrants, which consists of children and women. How is that not obvious and easy to understand?
iam living in Egypt and i have 2 empty apartments if there are any Syrian families need the help please contact me coz i can't reach any ....
Anyone know which production company they used to make this?
this is so devastating
WOW HOLLYWOOD MUCH
i thank camila cabello for telling me to watch th is
that's sad
Oh hey, it's part two of that video. Now my feels hurt.
it's crazy how they have to make the child and the mother white in order to make people care about what refugees are going through every day
This is so sad humanity is filled with evil I think but keep up the good work I think war will continue till the end of earth
Sadly but. There's also good
Yay depravity
The comment section is disgusting. Read at your own risk.
+pianolust same.
+pianolust so go to the syria and give them your life "work for them and give them your money"
+Carlota García I wish I'd seen your comment sooner. The lack of empathy makes me ill.
1:13 - 1:15  I lol'd  :D
I love how this video has the opposite effect.
propaganda at its finest
If these refugees were Jewish or Christian it wouldn't be a problem for anyone, period.
Yes, I just had to respond to some very idiotic people.
+Jiang Ming finally some one with brains
????????????????????
This was the old army advert I think
Pobres niños . Ellos no tienen la culpa de nada. Hagan algo por favot
was that the angel of the north that was on fire. Then at the start this must be set in England. I'm still confused
GamerGo123 it's supposed to  representation for what's going on in Syria right now. Yes The setting is kind of off but keep in mind it could happen anywhere even here in the US.
+Kevin Buri you can volunteer
@SaveTheChildren OK I will watch the first one then. Thanks!
Hi +GamerGo123 this video is a sequel to our original Second a Day film which showed what could happen if this was happening in Britain. In the latest video, Lily and her mum are fleeing Britain, which is why the Angel of the North is in the background. Hope this makes sense, and thanks for watching. Laura
Very good video!!!!















Allahu Akbar.
She looks like Elijah Wood
where's the video for the majority healthy military age males that show up?
And according to you, they are expected to defend their countries with what?
Most of these men have no military training, no weapons and are either wounded or have people relying on them.
It's not their fault that this war started, why should we discriminate on age and gender? My brother is of fighting age, but because we live in the UK he's not expected to fight.
So either fund them, train them, give them weapons and medical supplies and make sure their families are safe, or shut up and learn the facts.
LETS GET RIGHT INTO THE NEWS
0:29 wait why is the angel of the north there. (knowing me this was a stupid question)
@***** Oh, thankyou
Someone is here because of Camila's tweet??
This is the future accepting current 'refugees' will lead to.
This is unhuman.
Propaganda! Ofc that is sad when you represent it that way! But every story has to sides! ... Not gonna fall on this propaganda.
I don't get why people are so opposed to helping these refugees.
+Matthew Shields Bill Jenkins has common sense, you don't.
+Sophia because I care what you say. Oh wait I don't.
+Bill Jenkins hatred is just fostered by people not knowing one another. You should seek to show them the good in you why they shouldn't hate. 
But then again you seem to have irrational hate too what you've said is what people have said in the past about black people. 
Being 21 doesn't make a difference everyone has different views and age is not a factor.
+Bill Jenkins actually I've held such an opinion for quite some time now. 
What other nations would do is a sad justification. It doesn't matter what other nations would do.
And some people say that Merkel is a monster.......
+Bill Jenkins one of Soros' and other $ barons' tentacles :)
Save the Children? Fair enough, I have 0 problem with that, I have no problem with female immigrants either(in general), or boys under 12-14 years(they can still learn to live in another culture)... Sooo... I guess we can send back the 18-50 year old men?!  ...which means about 60-80% of the immigrants, that would be marvelous ...also the girl looks nothing like the girls from any of the regions people are coming from, isn't that racist, to put a white girl in this piece of propaganda? Is this how you represent the people??? Shame on you...
This happen in Ukraine too, you should know.
A prophetic video.
This is exactly what awaits Europa.
Is this video predicting the upcoming race war in Germany?

1. The refugees are 80% male
2. The refugees definitely aren't young white girls with freckles, they're going to be tanned 16+ fighting age men with hair all over their body.

This is 100% Germany 2017 and the girl in the video is a native German.
+Alfie Gibson thanks for your witty and understanding nature. just because the idiots bark louder here it doesnt mean that they are the only ones
+MrCefyou10 Agreed.
+Blade Strikes  an ADULTE MALE have to suffer? it's the same thing i m seeing a person sufruing doesn't mater if it's a male or female a chile adult, they have rights
+aNaNass what should we do with the other 20% then?
Refugges will bring this to your childrens
@guillermola Yeah when I say us I mean the western countries not civils
I dind´t bomb anybody, maybe politics and rich people but not us, Stop blame yourself people!
when europe falls there will be no place for that girl to run
+lordhefman is a weapon of creative  chaos be aware
@Zedanium Official during the ww2 some did indeed flee to the colonies but is this case going to another continent with a very big diference of culture could be not wise
+lordhefman well there s asia, africa , the americas and oceania , so there some others places that she can go
This will be great if 90% of the "refugees" were actual syrian refugees or any refugees from an actual war...
I think this is supposed to say something like "this could happen to anyone, even you." Hence the semi story revolving around this British girl.
Expect there are really never any women and children. Just able-bodied men.  :)
So, you want men who have no military training, weapons or supplies to fight an army of well funded, well trained men.
That sounds more like suicide to me.
So?
I haven't seen propaganda like this since the Soviet movie night in Tuesday's.
+Stefan Andrzejewski Western Europe 2025 the video.

i am Syrian and i wish if the world would start to give a solution to the head of the problem and end the murderer Bashar Al-Assad , because he is the reason of all this
Making that Israel actually made Isis
@Sherman Brown and what advantage of doing that he will get exactly ?!!
@Medo Homs
Then why isn't Assad telling Isis to attack Israel and I would be fans with Isis so no.
@Sherman Brown  if you have a moment just think about the facts only

that the Assad sends electricity and water and other stuff to ISIS and ISIS sends back .

it's  a known fat that ISIS sends gas and oil to Assad 

the Assad never operated an airstrike on ISIS 

the "free Syrian army" (the rebels) are at WAR with ISIS

so who do you think in interest to make ISIS

"" ISIS IS MADE BY THE ASSAD ""
You can clearly see a photojournalist tripping a refugee behind the girl at 1:14. A clear reminder of the Sept 2015 incident involving a man and his young boy falling to the ground after being tripped by photoreporter László Petra, while running from the Hungarian Police at the border.
+Bill Jenkins yeah, let's start up a charity organisation to help people who trip up and hurt kids or people carrying kids, how patriotic.

*sarcasm*
Propaganda
0:35 and I will kill you
+Yazan Shehadeh +Carolus as far as you people understand the situation, it's fine. Sorry for any misunderstanding and have a great day.
+Ultra Silver I know and because any body is american it's not ok to make jokes about the 9/11 right ? in my personal opinion jokes are jokes. when it's funny it just is.. so chill
+Ultra Silver oh please it's a joke A JOKE
+Yazan Shehadeh just because you are a refugee, it doesn't make it ok to make jokes here.
+Carolus I am not trying to make you look like an evil doer or anything. It's just not the best place to make jokes. That's what I meant.
i am speechless.
#Openbordersinisrael
Lovin' the propaganda great job! Doesn't change the fact that 81% of these 'refugees' are of the young male demographic, and now ask Cologne how that turns out??
rob wayans actually, 3/4 of refugees currently residing in turkey are women and children, sooooo
Still doesn't answer my question about how untrained men are supposed to fight, my brother is of military age, he hasn't done any military training and he doesn't have any weapons. If war broke out in the UK, why should he fight?
+rob wayans Source?
@Emma Rainbow It's not the army causing the problem, It's the Rebels and ISIS, Assad Is not the Evil Dictator the media Is making him out to be, I know a couple of people fighting In Syria and they're disgusted by the way the West has been treating them, Especially when Barrack Obama made a public speech saying that Assad had been using gas to kill civilians, when Infact It was the rebels doing It and the Government got the blame.
I wanna make a change for the refugees but I don't know how, I'm just a citizen with no job... I barely have money for me...
Same, we have two spare bed rooms in my house and we might be letting some stay with us
1:14 = hazugság.
Very powerful..
AllTime10s, You are Cancer to Youtube. Just like Cancer, It feeds more and more onto the Host body until there is nothing left, It multiplies and Multiplies. That is how it survives. Similar to how you guys survive by posting video after video basically expanding, While feeding off of Youtube's Ad Revenue. And just like Cancer, You attribute nothing good to Youtube. At Least many other Youtuber's give something to the Community, What do you guys give us? Nothing but repetitive video's everyone else has already done.
Thanks for watching +Alltime10s -Laura
Fluent english, jellycat toy rabbit.... What a true story LOL
Great video! Totally agree that we shouldn't put children  in a dingy separated from their parents and ship them  to a far far off country but put them  in safe nearby  countries *cough* (gulf states)
You let enough of those who want to enforce shria law onto you and you might just see this happen to you.  It is just a matter of time and numbers. One thousand?  Fine.  Ten thousand ? OK.  One million?  Well...
Except most of the refugees aren't even fleeing from a war zone.
@JohnTheRipper although you haven't come up with a proper counter - argument for either.
@Emma Rainbow Yes, both relevant to the current situation.
+JohnTheRipper First you said they weren't fleeing from a war zone, then you complained that they don't stay in the first country they come to.
@Emma Rainbow How did I change it?
+JohnTheRipper Also, every time I defeat your argument, you change it.
Where' the one where the healthy adult males cross perfectly safe countries to get to Germany?
This will never happen to the UK cause we live in a democracy
Hi there we meet again! Did you get my joke?
The "Did you get my joke" part is a sarcasm if you haven't figured it out yet.
You mean the same country which having the best cultural enrichments





I'm being sarcastic
but why most of the refugees are not little white girls? Why they are adult  black men?
What if they are black?
+medvedkofly can't believe six people liked your dumbass comment
nice propaganda. top notch quality
Brainwashing at it's finest. /claps
Happy Birthday! Hope you made a wish

;___ (
They even got the journalist tripping refugees in here at 1:14 wow
The Last part Damn!....
At 0:06 she is reading More Than This by Patrick Ness which is about "a teenage boy named Seth who, after drowning in the ocean, wakes up alone on a desolate suburban English street in what he believes to be hell". Powerful detail.
If I've learned anything, it's that the people who made this need to make a "Last of Us" Movie, would be amazing.
Isn't this advert really old... Why has it been re-uploaded and treated as new.
+L93bloomer :D hahaha the worst joke i ever seen in my hole life world
How can we fix this?
omg 16th may is my birthday too    small world
This video is beautifully made and really gets to point across. Makes me so sad 😢
+Vulpes Inculta 
The point is that many people of all races have a hard time understanding and sympathizing with people who are not of the same race or culture. This video is here in an attempt to make western English speaking white people empathize with the Syrian Refugees, as everything you just witnessed is an allegory of the typical journey these refugees make to arrive in western countries seeking safety. 

It is targeted primarily at white, english speaking people because currently it is white english speaking people who have the power to help, or destroy, these travelers. It is a response to the Xenophobia that has been running rampant, taking the actions of hundreds of bad, mostly dead people, and making it the stories and background of millions of good, normal humans who are just trying to survive. 

In short, it is an attempted to Re-humanize innocent people who have been ruthlessly dehumanized by many western politicians by replacing the skin color and language of foreigners with our own.
Thank you +Hannah Marie - I had the same reaction as you! Thanks so much for watching. Laura

stop voting..stop paying tax..stop joining armies..stop believing these lying murdering scum you keep voting for...just stop!
Really reminds me of Children of Men.
Yeah
Really reminds me of Children of Men.
Warning, there are some really cancerous comments down here.
no need to warn,  we'r all used to it by now,  but thanks anyway
Made me sad :(
Impactante vídeo
That's hit me hard.
@Vulpes Inculta true to be honest
+Holly Knight-Parfitt Don't worry. Give it twenty to thirty years, and between climate change, mass migration, terrorism and economic stagnation your country will look like that.
Man that was deep. Really.
Like the Mediterranean Sea for the refugees that can't swim XD
Disgusting.
Who were the amazing actors
Congratulations. You successfully made me want to give my money to charity. Y'know. If I had any.
I watched this video i while ago and then i saw camila cabello tweet about this and all the sad memories are coming back :(
Woah thats the same exact bday as me and on the same year
gg
To the children watching this video PLEASE BE AWARE. THIS VIDEO IS NOT REAL!!
It was created by an aid agency because they want you to give them your money.
Woooow..... #Speechless
Seriously, don't people realize that by taking in children from these warn torn countries in the middle east that they are saving them from being indoctrinated by extremist groups and actually giving them a chance to learn to love their fellow human beings? 

Terrorism cannot be defeated on the battlefield. in fact, that is where it is made. The only way you stop it is by removing the hate from the hearts and minds of our children.
@Emma Rainbow We're not talking about all other religions, so I don't see why. Also, the next time you talk about America's foreign policy, I will stress that you ought to talk of the crimes of the Mongols, the Chinese, the Koreans, the Japanese, the Slavs, the Huns, the Turks, et cetera.
+Vulpes Inculta I'm saying that of you are going to criticise one religion, you should criticise others that make the same mistakes.
@Emma Rainbow I am not a Christian, and I do not see how Christianity's faults excuse Islam's.
+Vulpes Inculta Christianity has some messed up ideologies as well.
Well done Lily! Burnt Mill is proud
Bloody hell I'm at the office crying like a baby just having watched this.
+Isabella Tamires go to hell this is a serious video and not somthing to laugh at.
If actors wouldn't look like people around me which I love, this movie would not have such impact on me (and propably others). That was the purpose.
 I'm waiting for the full movie, it would be propably good, especially with this girl.
At 1:14 is actually a true story. This did happen to a father and his child when a right-wing Hungarian journalist on purpose tripped them and the refugees fell on the ground.
+Zanting He was also involved in the killing of fifty unarmed Kurds during a football riot about ten years ago. Not exactly the kind of guy you'd want to have in your country.
+Atiq Khan The lies always stick.
+Zanting WOW had no idea 😑
+Atiq Khan That guy who was tripped was actually a member of al-Nusra Front.

why camila? why? I'm prying why do you do this to me? 😢
same I came here from camila and lol pry
I think it showed how it would actually be if the British were the ones that were migrating.
pesado...
So incredibly sad.
this is absolutely amazing! the saddest part (for me) was when people were treating her like filth.
this is clearly moral propaganda - accepting children and families into the UK and Germany ultimately incentivises more families risking their lives to get their children through thick and thin to get to Britain or Germany - and a huge proportion of these refugees are blatantly seeking work hidden by the chaos of the crisis  of the crisis (apparently the streets are paved with gold in London). 

Why is it the UK and the west are always morally responsible for any and every global catastrophe, and by de facto every refugee man woman and child? 

Hopefully this charity supports sending the refugee camps in safe countries nearest from where they originated and helping them there...
(Sighs) u don't understand
Says the ogrelord lover
+James Hurst There's nothing reasonable bringing in people with no background information. We saw that from Rotherham, Malmö, Calais etc.
we don't run we fight this is disgusting shame on you. and most of these economic migrants want money not safety why else would they end up crossing a continent of peace. to get to a island.
So they are meant to fight and defend their countries with what?
Most of these men have no military training, no weapons and are either wounded or have people relying on them.
It's not their fault that this war started, why should we discriminate on age and gender? My brother is of fighting age, but because we live in the UK he's not expected to fight.
So either fund them, train them, give them weapons and medical supplies and make sure their families are safe, or shut up and learn the facts.
An island* 

You knew it was coming
Conflicts that cause this are idoitic, these are children who have done nothing to anyone and yet they are still punished by some idiotic adults. Sometimes this makes me hate being the same race as the idiots who cause their suffering
+Bhuerile and this constant anti-Semitism needs to stop. I think you might actually get on with the Arabs you don't want coming here, they hate the Jews as much as you do.
This is what I hate about this debate. You lot make it a choice between two extremes- white guilt and ignorance. MaX, don't conflate what he's saying with leftism. And where is the need for you to mention autism and cuckolds? It lines your viewpoint with immaturity, and dejects people who might otherwise agree with you.
Really powerful
So did she made it to Syria?
so why do they come to Britain when there are countries right next to Syria that are not at war?
+Your Ad Here Cuz they've been brainwashed so hard by the leftists
Do western people honestly believe that people in the middle East would just simply accept us?

As a non Muslim in 2016, in peaceful Muslim majority areas, Christians etc… have had to pay a “Jizya” for decades, which is an additional tax levied by Islamic states, simply for being non-muslim. They also implement a Kharaj to non-muslims, which is an additional property tax. Both work as a forceful system to A: prevent non muslims from living in their land, and B: As an incentive for non-Muslim cultivators to convert to Islam so that they could maintain their agricultural holdings.
This girl deserves a freakin' emmy for this one.
I agree! This video has been done very well. I'm surprised it hasn't won any big awards
Powerful
This is pathetic propaganda.  Save the Children's CEOs will be getting a nice bonus after this. The majority of 'refugees' are fighting age males from African nations, not Syrian children. Europe cannot look after its own never mind the worlds poor.
+Emma Rainbow ah yes. Let's fall back on the 1% for not helping with problems in the world.
Maybe, if the top 1% chipped in then they could.
I see why the child is British, it's to reach the people who don't care about people from other ethnicities/cultures. But I don't think those people will ever react in a positive or helpful way to refugees, no matter how many times you show them that "we're not so different after all".
@*****
Your words made me cry a little ;-;
@***** By "those people", I didn't mean the British as a whole, Supreme Leader, only the bigoted ones.
+Mhuz Lord   Sadly you're right.
I been riding some coments and some people are just selfish what whoud you do if you was in the same situation?
+Sara Briddock We'll be in the same situation soon enough, due to climate change, mass migration and economic crisis.
+Sara Briddock Not invite a bunch of military aged male migrants or militants into my country. Problem solved
😭😭😭😭😭
So, people can't keep it in their pants, keep having children despite being in a horrific situation and automatically it becomes a problem for the rest of the world?
that's not the problem. The problem is what is shown in the video.
IF THE UK VOTES NO TO BREXIT, DONT EXPECT ANY AID FROM FRANCE, GERMANY OR IRELAND. ITS YOUR FAULT YOU VOTED IN YOUR DIVISIONIST POLITICIANS LIKE NIGEL FARAGE AND GEORGE GALLOWAY AND PUT THE LIKES OF PRINCE PHILLIP (WHO IS PRO EUGENICS) AND KATIE HOPKINS ON A PEDISTAL.
@The unconvenient truth You mention France and Ireland both of which to my knowledge are in a worse off position when it comes to debt than the UK and the main reason wages are staying stagnant is because of the endless supply of cheap foreign labour from both the EU and outside of the EU the British working class have been thrown on the scrapheap.
because your government of tories only is running you into record debt and a budget deficit, when they were elected to clear up the mess that labour left. They've done the complete opposite. Your country is at full employment but poverty is increasing, which is a miracle in itself. Your wages are staying stagnant. How many food banks are being opened across england over the past few years.
Why would we need aid we're the 5th largest economy in world...
Care to link a source?
You're right, we should stop letting the migrants in so we never have to go through this
+MaXiMuS54545 why do you always think negative. And by the way im only 16 i got no children nor a guy but i guess i have better thoughts than grown up people who only think in a narsessisic way.
@MaXiMuS54545 Doubt it.. I'm more likely to get hit by a car.
+Doland Trump Migrants don't do this in European countries, Americans and Europeans do this in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
And what you do turns back on you
If you help tham right now you will be helped then so stop caring only about yourself
powerful!
so effective, still remember the first one
You can't afford to let politics or race etc get in the way of the fact that children need help.  Even animals take on other animals young and we can't even do that and we're supposed to be more clever.  It's a sad tale and one that I'm sad to say will more than likely not have a happy ending.  Wish wars would stop.
There no words to describe this video
😢😭😭
why aren't you make such " touching " video about children of Ukraine which almost every day die  in Donbas  ??  ha ?
+brave edy Hey mate! That's the whole idea of the video. To connect with people who struggle to empathise with someone of another race :)
aaaaaaaah
No more wars!  Save the children! Unhuman leaders of the world!  We people must kick them out of this world...
Amazing work! :)
@Gavin 

This figure includes 2.1 million Syrians registered by UNHCR in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, 2.7 million Syrians registered by the Government of Turkey, as well as more than 29,000 Syrian refugees registered in North Africa.
Regional demographic breakdown below is based on available data from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.

Now make an educated guess who actually comes to Germany and Sweden you inbred.
+SaveTheChildren A good work from GOEBBELS STUDIES
+SaveTheChildren 

Too bad Children only make up around 15% of Refugees, while 70% being adult Males. Great work otherwise.
Truly stunning and heartbreaking. Really hope to see this continue the discussion the same way the first video did!
Hi +Liam Dryden, thanks for your comment, it really makes you think doesn't it! Laura
1:15 Anyone notice that reference to that photographer tripping a refugee a while ago?
+GiantMarkirs oh yes!
This video made me feel like changing my user right now, but I can't
I learned something today..l
Wow 😦
Damn.
I cried wow this is so sad that this is happening
Me too +olivialuxe - thanks for watching. Laura
Pt 2
Heh..I didn't cry.
It doesn't matter if you don't cry
All you need to do is to know that war in true naked form is a hell to live in, Soldiers and civillians, Children and adults, anyone
What happened to world peace eh?
+Mikaela_loves24  it never happend; it was all a lie.
No such thing if we still have leaders like this, and besides, when was there one year of this so called world peace
Another great video guys. #SaveSyriasChildren #SaveChildRefugees #SaveTheChildren
0:40 to 0:55 This is a reenactment of the death of Alan Kurdi. Rest in peace <3
+llookkaattmmee1 I dont have the power to save these people I work a job.  Go talk to Hillary Clinton, Obama and Cameron because these war mongers caused this mess.
+llookkaattmmee1 Ye i noticed that, RIP.
+llookkaattmmee1 His story broke my hear. RIP :(
Show this to Trump supporters everywhere
Absolutely heartbreaking.
Finally a video about refugees that isn't overwhelmingly disliked by racists or something !
Bloody powerful. I hope this makes a change.
@Γιωργος Καροφυλλακης It will if you donate to the link above, here it is again: http://save.tc/FC8530gaNMj, it might be a small change, but someones life will improve
Not enough 😢😢
Vulgres Ignoring the fact that 60 % of migrants coming to Europe are Women.
Inform yourself before to talk.
This will never happen to Britain
Jazza John right?!
Very powerful, very well made. Bet this'll get just as many views as the last one, if not more.
this really hit a hard note, especially the bit where the angle of the north was on fire, so close to home
+Anna Thew Yeh why would rebels set fire to the AotN though?
She has the same birthday as me!!!
Great video. Shame it had to be made.
Yes what a shame that children are in danger
@Ben Dover Please Elaborate.
Shame?
